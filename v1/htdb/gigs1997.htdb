				Sound was initially v. poor, but improved after the first song (CF
				Spacemen).  Vocals/rap handled by unknown person - sounded slightly
				unsure.  Female backing vox v. good throughout.  Musicianship
				excellent comme d'habitude.  Audience inc. sad hippy bloke but also
				luminaries such as Tim from Homer and Wotjek from BA.
				<p>
				Not just Butcher legacy here but felt that his vocals had an authority
				that was noticeably absent otherwise.  Liked new bloke though - maybe
				better sound would have helped him.  Sound problems worst for guitar.
				Lighting really good, incidentally.
				<p>
				Venue fortified, previous band quite dodgy (Rush fans), nevertheless
				fun evening - good impression made.  Girlfriend disappointed by
				rendition of CFS, and worried by presence of unfashionable sad hippy
				bloke.  Steve (raver) loved it.  Christie (teacher) liked it.  I
				thought it was brilliant.  There you go.

		From Pat Fish:  This gig is from the 12 Bar Club in London's "Tin Pan Alley", Denmark Street in the West End on Thursday 11th September 1997. Max and I booked it as a warm-up for the trip to Seattle and San Francisco. It was the first time that we had played a set together in public since 1985. You can kind of tell; both players are on their best behaviour. ðŸ™‚

			pat & max. & a kazoo. 
			wot? you don't remember the kazoo in any jbc song?  sure, you know

			well, maybe you're right. but not this night.
			max was definitely the hit of the evening. i was certainly glad of the
			chance to see him play. he really gets into it, eyes squeezed tight
			shut & grimacing. he & pat really seemed to have fun together, too.
			it'd be shame if they never did it again.
			i loved the version of zombie love--pat hit top form and it was the
			best rendition of that soung i've heard. it ended the set, right?
			angels and roadrunner were the encores i think.
			listening to _draining the glass_ now the songs seem too busy with

			Seeing Pat and Max perform together again took me back ten years.  Back to
			the days when CDs were making records obsolete.  But, I loved my
			records, especially all the JBC ones with those funny little messages
			inscribed near the label.  I had only seen the Jazz Butcher perform once
			in 1986 at the Berkeley Square in California.  Being underage at the time
			I had to use my older sister's ID to get into the club.  Little did I know
			that that would be the only time I'd see Pat and Max perform together
			until last night.  I fell off the face of the earth in 1987, left all my
			beloved music behind and only resurfaced this year.  Can you imagine I
			missed the whole music scene of the last decade?  Everything after
			Distressed Gentlefolk was new to me...But I could still sing along to all
			those familiar songs sung at the show last night.  Needless to say, those
			two gentlemen performing at the charming GAMH are still as cool and dapper
			as ever.
