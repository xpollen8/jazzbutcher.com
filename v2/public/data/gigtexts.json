Later, inspired by\n\t\t\tthe Stone Roses and Throwing Muses, Ramon picked up a guitar and started writing songs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tToday he plays hypnotically beautiful music with shimmering, clean guitars and atmospheric keyboard washes.\n\t\t\tSigned to the painfully cool Fishsoup Records (run by Bic Hayes, the \"other\" Pet Shop Boys guitarist), Ramon\n\t\t\thas recently completed his first album with ace producer Choque Hosein of Black Star Liner at the controls.

The album is the brainchild of Bristol\n\t\t\tnative Jesse Vernon, who is backed by Jim Barr and John Baggott of the\n\t\t\tbrilliant Portishead. Together, their songs place soul-rousing writing\n\t\t\tinside of atmospheres drawn from a Tom Waits dream of the afterlife. Never\n\t\t\tonce flinching into pop accessibility, the album flows on a cloudy drone\n\t\t\tthat peaks during the stellar fuzz of \"This is For You\" and ends with the\n\t\t\trousing \"Keepers of the Fire.\" So while the nu-crooner revolution may not\n\t\t\texactly be at hand, My Place in the Dust at least makes a good case for it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy Matt Charlton<br>\n\t\t\tExclaim Magazine - June 4, 2003\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tMORNING STAR<br>\n\t\t\tMy Place in the Dust (D7/Dep)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tProduced by PJ Harvey and Sparklehorse collaborator John Parish, and\n\t\t\tassisted by Portishead's Jim Barr and John Baggott, Bristol's Morning Star\n\t\t\t(aka Jesse D.

Their first, self-released album Bop Art acted as a\n\t\t\tstatement of intent, and the band soon landed an album deal with Fire Records of London. After a clutch of increasingly successful\n\t\t\treleases with Fire, in 1989 the band signed to Ensign Records who brought major label muscle to the promotion of the phenomenal\n\t\t\tSwagger album, the Sunday Times album of the year. The follow-up Beat Songs, recorded in Los Angeles and released in 1991, garnered\n\t\t\tfurther success with the critics and the public alike, and The Blue Aeroplanes continued to tour Europe, North America and Japan\n\t\t\tthroughout the nineties.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the turn of the century, Langley started his own record label, Art Star, on which the Aeroplanes released their latest and possibly\n\t\t\tmost triumphantly deranged album, Cavaliers, in 2001. The following year Langley released his first solo album, Record Player,\n\t\t\trevealing his long-standing affection for the underground rock of the seventies alongside the usual high-octane brew of poetry, malice\n\t\t\tand mayhem. At the time of writing, a new Blue Aeroplanes album has just been completed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor this exclusive acoustic appearance, Langley will be joined by Blue Aeroplanes guitarist and singer, Rodney Allen. Before joining\n\t\t\tthe Aeroplanes, Rodney was a successful solo artist in his own right, and he still occasionally tours with his own band, the Rodney\n\t\t\tAllen Experience. Expect a night of wild lyricism and distressed twenty-first century folk music run riot\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOpening the show are two talented solo artists from Northampton.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBee Church is a bright and engaging songstress, who is making her first appearance at Masters of Budvar after successful sets at the\n\t\t\tStrumpets & Pluckers night at the Racehorse in Northampton and the Deportees Club at the Castle in Wellingborough.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPaul Cox is well-known on the local scene as an acoustic balladeer and man-about-town. His classic original songwriting recently\n\t\t\tentranced the crowds at Northampton's Balloon Festival.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMasters of Budvar is a monthly live music night at the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1. It takes place on the first\n\t\t\tFriday of every month and entry is always free of charge.

With\n\t\t\this first album Foot Of Film now released and garnering warm reviews, Ramon is on his way to big things. For those who\n\t\t\tmissed his performance at Masters of Budvar last summer, Ramon plays an unbelievalbly simple, direct, honest set with\n\t\t\tacoustic guitar and voice. With these most basic of tools and a catalogue of richly melodic original tunes he charms you\n\t\t\tinto his own parallel universe.\n\t\t\tIrrational feelings of calm, beauty and warmth are the inevitable result. Could this be the start of the thaw?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tColumbus & Crusoe are a highly-rated new ensemble from Wellingborough. Young, fresh and original, they seem to be\n\t\t\tentirely unaware of the excitement that they are causing wherever they play. Another act that is high on melody...and\n\t\t\twith a glockenspiel too! Tonight they will be performing as a duo.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSpoiling the party with his ineptly recorded backing tapes and questionable guitar technique, we also present\n\t\t\tNorthampton's\n\t\t\tself-styled \"loudest solo artist\" Pat Fish. Get there early and marvel at his quaint misappropriation of mid-period\n\t\t\tTemptations guitar licks while you get the beers in.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn the record decks we have guest Superstar DJ Bic Hayes. Bic is the boss of Ramon's record label. He is also a world\n\t\t\tclass guitarist whose CV includes The Cardiacs, Levitation and Dark Star. He currently plays alongside Mark Refoy in the\n\t\t\tPet Shop Boys touring line-up.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs usual, all this comes for free in the unpretentious and genial surroundings of the Labour Club, Charles Street, NN1.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tExcerpts from a review of Ramon de Juan's first EP written by Sam Saunders, Leeds Music Scene:\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt is an exquisite piece of work. It's so much more than just mood music. Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your\n\t\t\tthing. But you have to stand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst\n\t\t\tyourself with joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one. There are some distant FX guitar touches and the\n\t\t\tlightest of electronic suggestions. It fades deliciously away, leaving a nostalgic and lonesome feeling as piano notes\n\t\t\tfall like gentle touches of silk. It is beautiful.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt isn't rock and roll, but it could save your love life.\n\t\t\tFour and a half stars\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\tPraise for Ramon's new album, Foot of Film:\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tFoot of Film does not clamour for attention; instead, it draws you in almost imperceptibly with its diet of delicate\n\t\t\tstrummery, patches of melancholy and whimsy and De Juan's pure, beseeching tones.\n\t\t\tFiona Shepherd - The Scotsman'\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.ramondejuan.com\" target=\"new\">www.ramondejuan.com</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t</blockquote>"},{"gigtext_id":365,"datetime":"2005-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Friday 1st April 2005\n\t\t\tMasters Of Budvar - at- The Labour Club, Northampton\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Moobs\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFrom Cheshire, the duo of guitarist/songwriter Jim Farmer and bassist Andy Shardlow has created a\n\t\t\tunique style that puts them at the leading edge of the developing New Acoustic scene.

When they weren't fighting for workers' rights\n\t\t\this parents introduced him to the wistful, witty and inspiring folk songs of the early 1930s American labour movement,\n\t\t\tmirrored in the union posters on the walls of Northampton's own Labour Club.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTurns out that like a fine wine you've never heard of but you know you're going to enjoy, Barry Melton is rich and\n\t\t\tsatisfying in the drinking. Far from stuck in a 1960s time warp, he recalls Woodstock psychedelia with the wry humour of a\n\t\t\tman who knows that getting wasted and writing songs about hamburgers falling in love with hotdogs is a novelty that just\n\t\t\twon't last.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tStill, he doesn't regret one moment of it, and neither do we as his awesome, and at times ridiculous, gravelly blues and\n\t\t\ttraditional union chants float into the night air, reminding Northampton that there's a vintage you can't buy on Camden\n\t\t\tHigh Street. And The Fish has it, down to a T.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<div class='credit'>\n<b>Credit</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"Northampton Chronicle & Echo\">Natasha House</a>\n\t<span class=\"hiddendate\">2005-08-05</span>\n\t<span class=\"date\">(Friday,  5<sup>th</sup> of August 2005 -\n\t18 years 27 days  ago)\n\t</span><!-- date -->\n</div><!-- credit -->\n\t\t\t</div>"},{"gigtext_id":373,"datetime":"2005-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Masters of Budvar present\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t-at-\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Labour Club, Northampton NN1\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFriday 5th August 2005\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCOLUMBUS & CRUSOE\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRising young band from Wellingborough with a uniquely chilled English sensibility and lots of mad little instruments.\n\t\t\tA welcome return to Masters of Budvar for this intriguing young band from Wellingborough.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tChilled, English and elegant is their thing.

Their 1999 waxing\n\t\t\t\"Out Of Here\" is a classic late night record, required listening for those who value the Velvet Underground's third album, Leonard Cohen or the tender\n\t\t\t(dark) side of the Perfect Disaster. More recently Tim lived and recorded in Paris, where he worked with ace French producer Kid Loco. He has also\n\t\t\ttoured and recorded with Robin Hitchcock (he can be seen in Jonathan Demme's \"Storefront Hitchcock\" movie) and played guitar with the Blue Aeroplanes.\n\t\t\tNow he is back in the UK and making a rare and precious solo appearance right here in Northampton.

He is also the kind of songwriter who can play his songs all on his own with just an acoustic guitar and\n\t\t\this unearthly voice and hold you spellbound, no less rock and roll than if he were fronting a full-on electric band with a ten-piece horn section. The boy just\n\t\t\tcan't help it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDave Kusworth has been playing professionally since 1977, and at the turn of the eighties he founded The Hawks with the great Micky Greaney and a teenaged Steven\n\t\t\tDuffy (last sighted writing the songs on Robbie Williams' new album, for goodness' sake!) He toured and recorded with UK rock legends the Dogs D'Amour before\n\t\t\thooking up with the Swell Maps' Nikki Sudden to record several albums for Glass Records, Creation Records and Glitterhouse Records under the name of The\n\t\t\tJacobites. He has toured all over the world and his wild, cracked, heartbreaking songs have been covered by The Lemonheads and Mercury Rev.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs I write this, Dave has just returned from touring Germany with his band (where he was joined onstage in Berlin by Sudden) and he has just completed his\n\t\t\tumpteenth album, the particularly magnificent \"Silver Blades\". He will be appearing solo and acoustic at Masters of Budvar, offering a rare and unmissable insight\n\t\t\tinto his astonishing knack for writing simple but devastatingly effective rock and roll songs. As a writer and as a frontline rock and roll road warrior, Dave\n\t\t\treally is in the same league as Peter Perrett or Keith Richards. We are honoured to host him and we hope that, come closing time, you will love him, yea, even as\n\t\t\twe love him.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.davekusworth.com\" target=\"new\">www.davekusworth.com</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPAUL COX & JOE WOOLLEY\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMasters of Budvar regulars will be familiar with the elegant balladeering style of Northampton artist Paul Cox.

After releasing a couple of albums on their own independent Oporto Records in 2002/3, they were snapped up by tuition (home of Go-Betweens and Kevin Ayers) in 2005.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's impossible to draw comparisons, so no one does!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHowever, their influences range from the melodic pop of The Go Betweens, through to Nick Drake, Love, Fairport Convention, The Velvet Underground right through to Erik Satie and Laurie Anderson, but this provides but a fraction of a guide to their unique musical appeal.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSpencer's unique musical talent creates sounds and landscapes which act as a cinematic canvas to singer-songwriter and former Blue Aeroplanes guitarist Caroline Trettine. Caroline, a former protegee of Billy Bragg, adds an extra dimension to The Winnebago Orchestra with her sensual and folk orientated vocal style.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe new Winnebago Orchestra album 'Born in the Sun' will be released in the UK, November 2007; Germany 25th January 2008; the USA and the rest of Europe January 2008 too.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thewinnebagoorchestra\" target=\"new\">www.myspace.com</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTHE HAVENOTS\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWell-loved local artist Liam Dullaghan and Sophia Marshall made two very well received albums as The Havenots.

NEVER SAY GOODNIGHT is the splendid second after 2003's BAD PENNIES, and the two song-writing youngsters (Liam Dullaghan and Sophia Marshall) already sound like old pros. Here they have an album solid with good songs, blends of gorgeous pop and unbridled folk-tinged melancholy.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t>From the rocky, Garbage-lite Sweetest Feeling to the fragile Ryan Adamsy Ghost to the ethereal Byrds influenced Lets Just Start Again, this bundle of tracks will no doubt to be a hit with both the alternative country in-crowd and Radio 2's more mainstream listeners. Sophia sings like a fallen angel while Liam tempers his smoky tones into a calm summer breeze. And Chicago songwriter Chris Mills guests on mandolin and synths as well as helping out with production.

By April Peter, with his teenage brother Jamie on Guitar (both sons of the ex Only Ones singer Peter Perrett) were invited to a recording session in Bethnal Green where they began work on the original recording of the Killamangiro single, which also included Seb Roachford (Acoustic Ladyland, Polar Bear) on drums. <br>\n\t\t\tWithin a week Doherty had moved into the Perrett household and they started touring around the country as Babyshambles. By June, Doherty had ended up in Thailand via The Priory and they saw less of him in person and more of him in headlines. For their 1st experience as professional musicians they were left some what disillusioned. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tAt the beginning of 2005 with a renewed thirst for playing music again, Peter and Jamie began looking for musicians to form a band. Recruiting their friend Eliot Vernon whom they met the previous year on a sound engineering D.S.S course, they played gigs like the Barfly, ULU, Rhythm Factory & Nambucca, ranging from a 4-6 piece under the working name The Cuts. Their then drummer James Kirkbright eventually had to leave due to medical reasons and the strains of commuting between Leeds and London. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tWhilst discussing the need for a replacement in their local hostelry in Kensington they were overheard by an eccentric Polish drummer, who introduced himself as their future! After an impromptu audition of table tapping and beer bottle bashing they were left convinced that the line-up was complete as the eventual 4 piece. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tWith Oskar Starski now in place and only in the band for a week, they were asked to appear at the Glastonbury Festival 2005 (in the medical tent!) where they were rewarded with free passes for the festival. At this time they did their 1st home recordings which included Psychobaby, Watery Eyes and Ten Watt Town. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tThey continued playing gigs along the way supporting Babyshambles, The Paddingtons, Cazals, The Maccabees, Selfish Cunt ... <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tNever satisfied with their band name, in January 2006 Jamie was inspired to come up with the name Love Minus Zero, not as a homage to Bob Dylan but more of a statement of intent. They set up a Myspace site and continued to gig under the new nom de guerre. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tSpring saw a flurry of gigs and a growing fan base, with a gig in Glastonbury in May being described by Jamie as \"The best reaction I've ever witnessed at a gig, even when I was in Babyshambles. An amazing show!\" <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tTheir 1st home recorded single \"Psychobaby\" was released last September on their own label and distributed through Cadiz/Pinnacle. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tReviews of Love Minus Zero:<br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\"A caustic riff-laden psychedelic maelstrom, the three track 'Psychobaby' single is the calling card of intent of Love Minus Zero. Immediate yet timeless, Love Minus Zero overthrow outmoded rock cliches with a gratifying urgency, splicing punk malice, psychedelic ska and searing guitars, as the 'Psychobaby' single attests.\" - Nina Antonia (Author and Music Journalist for Uncut and Mojo) <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\"I was seriously impressed by this group, so much so that I went to see them again the following night when they played my local!

Decades later, after several chance meetings in the UK,\n\t\t\tBarbeau approached each of them separately. \"The idea of the band really\n\t\t\ttook shape in Berlin in May 2010 when Morris and I met to record, \" says\n\t\t\tBarbeau, \"but I'd asked them each at different times, and both seemed\n\t\t\tkeen.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBarbeau began writing songs specifically for TMT in June 2010, soon after\n\t\t\tthe group's debut gig at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford. The final product, \n\t\t\tmuch of it recorded at Kimberley Rew's Remote Farm studio in\n\t\t\tCambridgeshire, sounds slightly more pared down compared to Barbeau's\n\t\t\trecent work, partly due to Metcalfe's influence as co-producer.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"I've had many bands, but this the most a part of something I've ever\n\t\t\tfelt,\" says Barbeau. \"The fact that it's with Andy and Morris is amazing\n\t\t\tfor me. I'm proud of how the album reflects the intense effort and\n\t\t\tenthusiasm we all shared from the start, shaping the unique sound you hear\n\t\t\tnow.\" \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.threeminutetease.com\" target=\"new\">www.threeminutetease.com</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPS - Keep an eye on the Youtube channel.

Dazed from the explosion, his eyes smarting in the early dawn light he stumbled into a narrow sidestreet.\n\t\t\tPausing\n\t\t\tfor a moment, back up against a wall, ever conscious of being recognised he put on his dark glasses and fumbled for a cigarette. Lighting it, he gazed up for a\n\t\t\tmoment at the stars dimly gleaming in the narrow shard of sky cut from between… the silhouetted buildings. It hadn’t always been like this, this name, this\n\t\t\tlife,\n\t\t\talways having to be running from he knew not what. He straightened, and headed off into the twisting maze of city streets. The fire and noise in his head made\n\t\t\tfinding his way difficult, and for a while he wandered unsteadily through the city, eerily deserted at that early hour. ‘You’d better get going’ a voice\n\t\t\tsuddenly\n\t\t\twhispered softly behind his left ear. Georges stiffened, and, whirling round, saw nothing but the steam gently rising from a street vent. He set off at a\n\t\t\tsprint,\n\t\t\tmaking his way to the river winding its sinuous route through the city’s heart. This time he had guessed right, the tide was still out and, clambering down the\n\t\t\tsteps to the bank he found his car still parked where he had left it. Igniting, tyres screeched as the old Ford spluttered into motion. Georges was soon at the\n\t\t\tcity\n\t\t\tlimits, the car careered out onto the main road out of town and he headed east into the slowly rising sun. Later, driving fast out on the freeway, the wind\n\t\t\twhistling on the shield, he took the rise and, looking down over the vast expanse now spread before him he remembered the song that had stayed with him\n\t\t\tthrough everything else. The music remained, a piano and saxophone was all he needed. The haze had now lifted, he now knew what he had to do…\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.georgeskaplanpresents.com\" target=\"new\">Georges Kaplan Presents</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tplus……\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJB NEWMAN & THE BLACK LETTER BAND JB Newman & The Black Letter Band bring you a shot of single malt rock ‘n roll with a shade of Noir style and a\n\t\t\tpoetic twist.\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jbnewmanmusic\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t+ Pat Fish ( The Jazz Butcher )\n\t\t\t<div class='artist_website'>\n<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/6182296219\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a>\n</div><!-- artist_website -->"},{"gigtext_id":536,"datetime":"2013-10-11T20:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Yeah, <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a>'s launching his EP record with his band.

Alan McGee picked up on the band early on, and their first single, “Think!” (CRE 004) was in the second batch of releases on McGee’s fledgling Creation label in 1984. An amazing blast of fresh air and optimism, it was recorded for the princely sum of £50 at Alaska Studios, Waterloo. Another superb single, ‘Where The Traffic Goes’, and 18 minute mini-LP ‘One Two Three Four Five Six Seven, All Good Preachers Go To Heaven’ followed in quick succession before the end of 1984. All these records had a fetching, moddish art-pop slant and received outstanding reviews, with the Minks being nominated by NME as one of the best new acts in Britain.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFollowing a European tour, supported by McGee’s new protoges The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Jasmine Minks put out a punkier, Buzzcocks inspired, single, ‘What’s Happening’ in 1985 before embarking on recording their debut full length album, set to be named ‘Everybody’s Got to Grow Up Sometime’. This eventually emerged 18 months later, self-titled and patched together from a variety of different sessions after the original tapes were abandoned.\n\t\t\tIn-between times in 1986, the band released ‘Cold Heart’, a song that McGee had originally cut from ‘Preachers’ but which turned out to be their biggest selling single, single of the week in NME, and it also secured them a John Peel session. At this point Sanderson left the band and it took some time for Shepherd to take up the reins and carve out a new future for the Minks.\n\t\t\tJasmine Minks returned in 1988 with a new line-up, helmed by Shepherd (now on lead vocals and also sole songwriter) and their best album ‘Another Age’. This was an altogether more accomplished effort with a reflective mood, including the stand-out track ‘Cut Me Deep’, which also featured on Creation’s ‘Doing It For The Kids’ compilation the following year. Sadly, The Minks new crafted and considered approach was out of touch with the baggy loved-up zeitgeist and they managed just one more album , 1989’s ‘Scratch The Surface’ before they drifted apart in the early 90s.\n\t\t\tHowever, Jim Shepherd’s restless muse has led him to reconvene the Jasmine Minks several times since then, and McGee also never forgot his “amazing, unknown gem of a band” either, funding another album ‘Popartglory’ in 2001 on Poptones, the label he started after Creation’s demise. One of the tracks on that record, ‘Daddy Dog’, attracted an unprecedented period of notoriety for the band in Scotland, helped by featuring firebrand socialist politician Tommy Sheridan.\n\t\t\tIt is now 5 years since their last shows, and Jasmine Minks will be returning in 2017 playing their classic album ‘Another Age’ in full at their comeback show at The Continental.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher Quartet\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t“The Jazz Butcher is one of the most brilliant incisive pop writers that Britain has produced since the glory days of Ray Davies and Pete Townsend. Criminally overlooked by a media obsessed with the next big thing instead of what is actually good. A truly great songwriter” Alan McGee, president , Creation Records\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher is the nom de guerre of Northampton’s Pat Fish, who over the years has masterminded various Groups, Conspiracies, Sikkorskis from Hell and, latterly, a Quartet.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA cult figure right from the start, The Jazz Butcher developed a not altogether serious sozzled Brit pop aristocrat persona, a million years before Brit Pop, with musical nods to Jonathan Richman (‘Roadrunner’ was memorably covered by the Butcher early on), Robyn Hitchcock and Lou Reed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPat formed the band in Oxford in 1982 (after he had previously been a member of Wow Federation while at university in the city) with Max Eider, who proved to be the Butcher’s most loyal co-conspirator. Max has now retired, but features on most of The Butcher’s 15 or so albums released since then, beginning in 1983 with ‘Bath of Bacon’, on Glass Records, alongside fantastic debut single ‘Southern Mark Smith’, regarded by absolutely everyone who’s heard it as one of the best songs of the eighties. Further albums on Glass, ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ and ‘Sex and Travel’ featured guest appearances from David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 1988 The Jazz Butcher instigated a transfer to Creation Records, where he became one of the label’s best loved acts, releasing seven albums for the label starting with ‘Fishcotheque’ in 1988 and ending with ‘Illuminate’ in 1995, with loads of drunken touring in-between, establishing enclaves of Butcher fanatics all over Europe and the States.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThereafter, Butchery continued, but very much underground, with only occasional peeks over the parapet such as the ‘Glorious and Idiotic’ album on Roir in 2000, until the Butcher’s legion of followers worldwide crowd-funded the ‘Last of the Gentleman Adventurers’ album in 2012.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRenowned archive trawlers Fire Records, have recently started up a Jazz Butcher reissue campaign, beginning in Feb 2016 with the long sold out ‘Adventurers’ album, and Pat is also back with a new band, the Jazz Butcher Quartet. Whilst Pat is often out and about solo in Northampton and the South, full Quartet shows are pretty rare, and he’s also not played in the North for a long time, so don’t miss this opportunity to see the legendary Jazz Butcher and his band at The Continental."},{"gigtext_id":555,"datetime":"2017-04-27T19:30:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<blockquote class=\"annotation\">\n\t\t\t<i>\"Along with Alan Moore and Rockingham Castle, Pat Fish remains a Northamptonshire institution.

Disappointment was an inevitability.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFish failed to “get” the glam rock thing (probably too much of an excitable wee football fan) and found that the seventies drove him down some fairly obscure musical paths before punk rock came along to save the day. By then, however, all those mad little songs by Eno, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen, John Cale, Peter Blegvad and Tony Moore were already locked up in his head.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFish started making records under the name of the Jazz Butcher in 1983 and nobody has quite succeeded in putting a stop to this yet. He has recorded for Glass Records, Creation Records, ROIR of New York and Vinyl Japan of Tokyo. Overall he has written and released fifteen albums of original music, three live albums and innumerable singles and compilations.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 2016 Fire Records issued the album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, originally released as a fan-funded project in 2012. In 2017 Fire will be undertaking a major re-issue programme, making several Jazz Butcher albums available once again on vinyl, CD and digital formats.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith the Jazz Butcher, Fish has toured worldwide. As a solo artist, recent shows include Hamburg, Dortmund, New York City, Tokyo, Brussels and London, as well as his adopted home town of Northampton where he still regularly turns out with his acoustic guitar to support visiting artists.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHe likes collaborations, too. Apart from his lengthy association with Northampton-based digital hooligans Wilson over the years 2001-2009, Fish has recorded and appeared on stage with David J, Spacemen 3, Bristol’s The Blue Aeroplanes, German band M Walking On The Water, French indie art rock band Chelsea Paris and acclaimed Los Angeles shoegazers, The Black Watch.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe thing about Pat Fish is that he is not tribal about music. Some people know him from his friendship with Spacemen 3, others for his fondness for Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; some know him because he has worked with members of Bauhaus, others regard him as a “classic” independent songwriter in the vein of Pete Astor or Dan Treacy. Fishy just fetches his acoustic guitar and his notebook and heads for the railway station.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHis current inspirations: as always, the Velvet Underground, Alex Chilton, Peter Laughner, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers, John Martyn, Davy Graham and many, many more.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDo you like your melodies sweet and your humour as black as pitch? Would you take a chance on something simple, intimate and direct from an artist who is on record as saying “What I do is not entertainment” but who regularly induces little bursts of outraged laughter from the audience? Do you want to see the real thing? You should maybe go and see Pat Fish.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<b>Plus</b>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSHORT STORIES: Formed in 2007 in Bristol, England by Tim Rippington and Stephen Miles. Tim and Stephen were at school together, a year apart but sharing the same musical values that made them firm friends. After school, the two went their separate ways – Tim spent the next twenty years playing in various indie bands such as the Flatmates, the Five Year Plan and later the Beatnik Filmstars. He also ran his own recording studio for five years, and produced records for, amongst others, the now legendary indie label Sarah Records. In 2003 Tim formed a new band Forest Giants, who made four great LPs before folding in 2007. In the meantime, Steve became a school teacher, dabbling only briefly in music with a spell as drummer for Bristol indie band Modesty Blaise.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 2007 the two met for the first time in 20 years, and discovered that they still had much in common and The Short Stories were born. Since then several albums and singles have been released which can be heard here, \n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"new\">https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/</a>"},{"gigtext_id":557,"datetime":"2017-05-25T19:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Labour Party social event featuring the Labour Party Candidate Kevin McKeever\n\t\t\twith a live set by the Jazz Butcher Quartet.

The term genius is bandied around all too casually in the wacky world of pop, but in this case it barely does this band's simple but beautiful songs, sometimes deeply poignant, occasionally angry, from time to time hilarious and always truthful, justice.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Television Personalities were Kurt Cobain's favourite band,  MGMT wrote 'A Song For Dan Treacy' for their 2010 album \"Congratulations\", and Alan McGee, who joins us as our DJ for the night and to whom we are indebted to for his support of this gig, once described him as \"the poet laureate of working-class London\". He credits the Television Personalities for inspiring him to start Creation Records. Their fingerprints are all over the work of every indie outfit to have followed them.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMany special guests will be invited to join musicians from the numerous and varied line-ups over the years of the TVPs. Some will be announced as we have further details, others will be surprises on the night. What we can promise you is a unique, one time only celebration of some of the most perfectly crafted and influential music of the last 40 years.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDaniel sustained a serious brain injury in 2011 and is for now receiving full time residential care. All proceeds from tonight's show will go directly to help him and his family to maintain for him the best possible quality of life.

He has recorded for Glass Records, Creation Records, ROIR of New York and Vinyl Japan of Tokyo. Overall he has written and released fifteen albums of original music, three live albums and innumerable singles and compilations.\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tThe thing about Pat Fish is that he is not tribal about music. Some people know him from his friendship with Spacemen 3, others for his fondness for Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; some know him because he has worked with members of Bauhaus, others regard him as a “classic” independent songwriter in the vein of Pete Astor or Dan Treacy. Fishy just fetches his acoustic guitar and his notebook and heads for the railway station.\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tHis current inspirations: as always, the Velvet Underground, Alex Chilton, Peter Laughner, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers, John Martyn, Davy Graham and many, many more.\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tAsbo Derek\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tAsbo Derek's sound is classic garage punk rock and they have a lot of (important) message songs but all have great choruses to join in with and many come with a running gag and punchline.

She has more recently helped write women back into the official history of punk with her book 'The Lost Women Of Rock: Female Musicians Of The Punk Era', which has interviews with The Mo-dettes, The Slits and Dolly Mixture amongst others. Helen's songs are beacons of outside of everything lyricism, and her set shall consist of songs from her new LP 'The Sea' and classics of yore."},{"gigtext_id":570,"datetime":"2019-04-06T22:30:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"La banda británica the Jazz Butcher aterriza en Valencia en formato dúo electroacústico donde repasará sus más de 35 años de carrera artística con grandes obras maestras como “A Scandal in Bohemia” “Fishcotheque” o” In Bath of Bacon” aparte de alguna versión de grupos que le influenciaron como Syd Barret o Velvet Underground.

It is likely my most prized\n\t\tpossession and it cost me nothing. They say meeting your idols can be dangerous as they may not live up to your idea of\n\t\tthem. More on that later...and sorry (not sorry) for the long post.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe Jazz Butcher has been the soundtrack of my life, from 1986 to present. Just like Thomas Peterson, Bloody Nonsense was\n\t\tmy first album, though the Canadian version differed a bit from the U.S. I never stopped listening to Pat. I loved and\n\t\tlove his music dearly. Like many of you have said, it got me through good times and bad and - I cry as I write this - I\n\t\towe him a lot.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tI'm glad I got to convey my gratitude to him over the years (many have used the word fandom in their posts) - Facebook\n\t\tMessenger is great that way for being able to reach out to people, even people you don't really know. And, as my wife\n\t\tKathleen and I planned a UK trip for April 2019 (remember travel?), I reached out to Pat and said we'd be coming up to\n\t\tNorthampton and I'd love to buy him a beer or five to show my appreciation for how much his music has meant to me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tMuch to my elation, Pat was game. We arrived in Northampton - couldn't get there any quicker, really, as we landed in\n\t\tLondon and pretty much took a train there immediately. And, after an initial scare where I didn't quite have his right\n\t\tphone number, Pat and I connected on Messenger again and agreed to meet at The Lamplighter for 7 pm. As our cab\n\t\tapproached, I saw this tall, harrowing figure walking into the pub and I knew it was him. This was happening - so many\n\t\tfeelings were swirling about inside me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWe introduced ourselves, grabbed pints and sat. And then - acutely starstruck - I pretty much forgot how to speak for\n\t\tabout 45 minutes. Luckily this rarely happens to my wife, so she held the fort during that time. I eventually came out of\n\t\tmy shell and...it was just wonderful. \n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t(BTW friends had asked me, before our trip, \"what will you ask him?\", and I purposely had no questions prepared. I didn't\n\t\twant this to be an interview and I didn't want it to be all about me. I just wanted to hang out with Pat and get to know\n\t\thim a little bit.)\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tHe was so gracious and generous. Beer and conversation flowed freely. He was kind and interested in us. We were then\n\t\tjoined by his good friend Rachel McGrath, who got me to express my fandom by asking me, at some point, what my top 5 JBC\n\t\tsongs were. I rhymed them off easily, with the top one being, since forever, Big Saturday (as I'm crying again).\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tImagine how over the moon I was when Pat invited us back to Fishy Mansions for a nightcap. How I held my cool, I've no\n\t\tidea - maybe the drink, or maybe by that time it was clear how genuine Pat was. And, around 1 am, Pat grabbed a guitar,\n\t\tand then my wife - I will forever be indebted to her - asked Pat to \"play Jean's favourite song, Big Saturday\". He\n\t\tobliged, and as I sob now, that's also me sobbing in the video at the beginning. I just lost it. I literally pinched\n\t\tmyself, couldn't believe this was actually happening.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWhat a perfect evening getting to know a lovely human being, if only a bit. Meeting my idol exceeded my expectations and\n\t\tby far.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tIt is also incredible to have read your posts and know that this kind of interaction with Pat was commonplace. He made so\n\t\tmany people so happy by being so generous.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tFinally, as all of you, I am heartbroken today. My heart goes out especially to those who knew him much more so than I\n\t\tdid, his friends and loved ones. I am so sorry for your loss. It seems Pat was every bit as good to his loved ones that\n\t\the was to simple fans like me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tI treasure the memory of having met Pat and am so grateful to him, and for the fact that we still have his music. JBC\n\t\tforever, folks.

A keen JBC fanatic, he used to\n\t\t\tbe in a band called Ringo, who did nowt, but with his good looks\n\t\t\tand his sharp lyrics, he *will* go far.  Mulreany and Allen\n\t\t\twheeled out the same set as last night, and again the only good\n\t\t\tbits were Rodney's <i>Fun</i> and their Beatles number,\n\t\t\t<i>Driving Me Mad</i>.  But what do I know?  It's a lot better\n\t\t\tthan I could do.  By the way, the girl behind me thought Mulreany was\n\t\t\tPaul Weller.\n\t\t\tThen oh my goodness!  It's the Butcher.

If you want to know how good the gig was, just\n\t\t\tthink: this didn't spoil my evening.  Made a mental note to\n\t\t\tcancel the cards, and threw myself back into it all.  If you've\n\t\t\tnever seen the Blue Aeroplanes, do so now!  Before anything\n\t\t\thappens to them.  And then see them again.  Afterwards.  Claim\n\t\t\tyou always loved them.

The backing vocalist and\n\t\t\tharmonica player looked like they were having a lot of fun: jazz dancing\n\t\t\tbehind Max's back.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCompletely agree with Jonathan about Ubu Swirl - very Velvets, very\n\t\t\tSpacemen 3 - I was on the verge of shouting out for Transparent Radiation.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe JBC:  They were a little constrained by the size of the stage: they\n\t\t\tdidn't rock out as they did at last summer's Borderline gig.  Pat looked\n\t\t\tgood in his suit, but got lost behind his shades (a bad decision), and the\n\t\t\twhole gig felt slightly hurried (Blues For Dead Dean Reed at what seemed\n\t\t\tlike double tempo) and slightly impersonal: he didn't talk between songs\n\t\t\tas much as at last year's Acoustic Conspiracy gigs, though there was a\n\t\t\tgood story about Pete Astor, a capo, and an adventurous german woman.\n\t\t\tDooj was more restrained than usual.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThey opened with Rosemary Davis, the only song from Love Bus.  Of the new\n\t\t\tstuff they did: Cute Submarines, Scarlet, Ugliest Song in the World, When\n\t\t\tEno Sings, Blues for Dead Dean Reed.  The song by the Austrian who lives\n\t\t\tin the mountains was Stereo Queen by <span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/wolfgang_tschegg.html\">Wolfgang Tschegg</a>\n\t</span><!-- person -->, which Pat has been\n\t\t\tdoing in his solo gigs for a while: it's sounding better every time: he\n\t\t\tshould record it sometime."},{"gigtext_id":235,"datetime":"1995-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Ed Carter","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Sitting as I am in an 'Internet Cafe', there's not a lot of time\n\t\t\tand I'm not really composed enough to offer a detailed description\n\t\t\tof events.

Schneck</P>\n\t\t\t<P>I got to see this show because of a vision\n\t\t\t I had.  I know that sounds mad, but I can't think of a better\n\t\t\t word.   During my lunch hour, one day in late August, I was walking\n\t\t\t to Chinatown in Boston, listening to the Jazz Butcher song \"Rosemary\n\t\t\t Davis World of Sound\" on my headphones.  I suddenly had\n\t\t\t an image in my head of being in New York with my friend Jerry\n\t\t\t and Pat Fish (a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher).  When I got back to work,\n\t\t\t I looked up the Jazz Butcher web site and saw that he was playing\n\t\t\t several shows in the US, including one in New York City.  I told\n\t\t\t Jerry and he got us tickets for the show.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>I'm not going to attempt to give a full history\n\t\t\t of the Jazz Butcher; there's a wonderful web site (actually,\n\t\t\t it's pretty much the only worthwhile thing I've seen in my limited\n\t\t\t use of the Internet) at jazzbutcher.com.\n\t\t\t  He's been around since the\n\t\t\t early eighties, but stopped playing as the Jazz Butcher a few\n\t\t\t years ago; currently he's not on a label and nearly all of his\n\t\t\t records are out of print.  His music ranges from silly drinking\n\t\t\t songs to social commentary to gorgeous romantic guitar numbers\n\t\t\t - guess which ones are my favorites!  He doesn't play in the\n\t\t\t US very often, and I really never expected to get to see him\n\t\t\t play.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>We got to the club around the time it was\n\t\t\t supposed to open, and of course it didn't open on time.  I could\n\t\t\t hear the tantalizing sounds of the Jazz Butcher's sound check\n\t\t\t coming through the metal curtains covering the entrance; I recognized\n\t\t\t \"Mr. Odd.\"  Wetlands, on Hudson Street, has the appearance\n\t\t\t of an abandoned warehouse, but Jerry had bought the tickets there\n\t\t\t so we knew we were in the right place.  We positioned ourselves\n\t\t\t on the ramp near the entrance and amused ourselves people-watching\n\t\t\t and singing \"All Tomorrow's Parties.\"  Quite a few\n\t\t\t cute people in the crowd.  Eventually they opened the curtains\n\t\t\t and turned on the lights and made us line up and wait some more.\n\t\t\t  As we were waiting, a tall, gaunt man in a suit came over the\n\t\t\t chains at the opposite side of the entrance and went into the\n\t\t\t club.  Jerry said something about him looking like he was dead.\n\t\t\t  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Finally they started letting us in.  The club\n\t\t\t was small but well laid out.  To my right as I entered were the\n\t\t\t stairs to the bathrooms downstairs and a DJ booth made out of\n\t\t\t a wrecked van; to the left were steps up to the bar.  Further\n\t\t\t back, the stage was against the right wall, with a dressing room\n\t\t\t area in the back right corner and seating along the left wall.\n\t\t\t  Jerry and Sophie got places in the back left corner and then\n\t\t\t Jerry and I went to the bar.  While he was buying drinks, I noticed\n\t\t\t the tall, gaunt man we had seen before.  He was signing autographs.\n\t\t\t  It was Max Eider, the guitarist.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>I couldn't sit still, so I found what I hoped\n\t\t\t was a good spot near the right-hand corner of the stage, and\n\t\t\t stood against a pillar drinking my beer.  I happened to look\n\t\t\t over my right shoulder and saw Pat Fish.  I felt my face light\n\t\t\t up in a big grin, and he smiled at me.  At that point, I didn't\n\t\t\t care what the rest of the evening was like.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>There was a long wait before the opening band\n\t\t\t played.  They had the unfortunate name Asseaters U.K.  Their\n\t\t\t singer seemed drunk and embarrassed, but they didn't play very\n\t\t\t long.  Someone said that the last song that they did was a Mekons\n\t\t\t song, but it wasn't one that I knew.  Immediately after they\n\t\t\t left the stage, a red-haired woman in jeans and a short-haired\n\t\t\t guy in a red t-shirt began setting up effects boxes and other\n\t\t\t equipment.  The club was quite full and I was glad that I had\n\t\t\t claimed my spot early.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Finally, Max Eider and Pat Fish came onstage,\n\t\t\t to tremendous applause.  Someone helped Max over to a stool,\n\t\t\t right in front of where I was standing.  Pat was a little to\n\t\t\t the left.  I had a great view, except that the stage lights weren't\n\t\t\t on.  Pat said, \"I'm comfortable with my sexuality, could\n\t\t\t we have some light up here?\"  He talked about how he just\n\t\t\t found out that Wetlands donates any profits they make to environmental\n\t\t\t causes, and said, \"What a good room to be in!\"  They\n\t\t\t started the show with \"Partytime.\"  As Pat sang, \"I\n\t\t\t could look at all the girls that are in this room,\" he looked\n\t\t\t around at all the girls in the front row.  He was extremely attractive,\n\t\t\t although not conventionally handsome.  Dark hair, dark eyes,\n\t\t\t great eyebrows, several teeth out - very British.  He wore a\n\t\t\t dark blue suit over a grey cotton knit shirt with buttons at\n\t\t\t the neck, and soft-looking black leather shoes.  Max was wearing\n\t\t\t a suit and black Doc Martens.  Max was playing a hollow-bodied\n\t\t\t electric guitar, Pat a solid-bodied one with a sticker of a head\n\t\t\t of a cat wearing a rhinestone collar and winking its left eye.\n\t\t\t  Several times during the first part of the set he made comments\n\t\t\t about them playing \"pussy music.\"  He also told the\n\t\t\t audience \"Relax, we're going to be up here for hours,\"\n\t\t\t and referred to the show as the last Jazz Butcher show of the\n\t\t\t century (Wetlands billed it as the last ever.)  After \"Partytime\"\n\t\t\t came \"Too Much Falling In Love,\" then Max Eider sang\n\t\t\t his song, \"Raking Up the Leaves.\"  He seemed horribly\n\t\t\t nervous or something, but his singing and playing were gorgeous.\n\t\t\t  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>They were then joined by Owen Jones, who with\n\t\t\t Pat and Max played on the earliest Jazz Butcher recordings, through\n\t\t\t 1986's <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>.  He was dressed more casually\n\t\t\t than the others, wearing a striped knit shirt, and had sandy\n\t\t\t brown hair.  Pat thanked someone at the club for lending them\n\t\t\t the accordion which Owen Jones was about to play, and said that\n\t\t\t theirs had gotten smashed by United Airlines - \"Boo United\n\t\t\t Airlines!\"  He urged everyone to fly Delta.  He then introduced\n\t\t\t \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish\" as a song about small gold\n\t\t\t fish.  The previous weekend I had bought a pair of costume-jewelry\n\t\t\t earrings for fifty cents from an eccentric old lady at a yard\n\t\t\t sale; they were strings of gold-colored fish.  I took them off\n\t\t\t the earrings and put them on safety pins, and thought that I\n\t\t\t would give one to Pat Fish if I got the chance to speak to him.\n\t\t\t  As soon as I heard him say, \"Small gold fish,\" I took\n\t\t\t off one pin and tossed it onto the stage.  He looked at it and\n\t\t\t left it lying there.  Pat also told what he referred to as a\n\t\t\t joke and said that he was testing people's reactions to it -\n\t\t\t \"In Seattle there was dead silence.\"  He said that\n\t\t\t when he was about eight, a kid came up to him on the playground\n\t\t\t and said, \"You know your dad?\" and he said yeah and\n\t\t\t the kid said, \"He drives with his brakes on.\"  Later\n\t\t\t on in the set, he finished up a song by saying, \"He drives\n\t\t\t with his brakes on, ladies and gentlemen, the Jazz Butcher.\"</P>\n\t\t\t<P>After \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\"\n\t\t\t Pat switched to bass and handed his guitar to Owen Jones, who\n\t\t\t sang his song \"<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Don't Let Me Keep You</i>\n\t<span class=\"song_author\">(<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/owen_jones.html\">Owen Jones</a>\n\t</span><!-- person -->)</span>\n\t</span>,\" which was very\n\t\t\t sad and lovely.  Max then sang \"Who Loves You Now?\"\n\t\t\t  Then Pat switched back to guitar and introduced Patrick Byrne,\n\t\t\t who he said had flown all the way from London that day to play\n\t\t\t with them.  He was wearing a light-colored suit coat over a dark\n\t\t\t shirt, and had a rather peculiar haircut with shaved sides; we\n\t\t\t had noticed him outside the club before the show.  He played\n\t\t\t kazoo and harmonica.  Max sang \"D.R.I.N.K.,\" with kazoo\n\t\t\t accompaniment by Pat, Patrick and (I think) Owen.  Pat then introduced\n\t\t\t Steven B. Ballantine, who joined them on bass.  He was someone\n\t\t\t whose name I didn't recognize - he looked young and a little\n\t\t\t shy, and was wearing a suit, I think.  Near the end of the set,\n\t\t\t Pat thanked him especially and said that he drove the van on\n\t\t\t the West Coast, played bass \"and is also the band's attorney.\"\n\t\t\t  Following the drinking theme, they played \"Soul Happy Hour.\"\n\t\t\t  On the recorded version, the introductory lyric is \"The\n\t\t\t best things in life are free/But you can give them to the S.D.P.\"\n\t\t\t (the Social Democratic Party).  When they played the song, Pat\n\t\t\t sang, \"The best things in life are free/But you can give\n\t\t\t them to Spacemen 3.\"  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>As I mentioned before, most of my favorite\n\t\t\t Jazz Butcher songs are the woozy, romantic ones from his later\n\t\t\t albums.  Since they were all recorded with a different band,\n\t\t\t I didn't really expect him to play them, and he didn't.  The\n\t\t\t one song I was really dying to hear was \"Angels,\" from\n\t\t\t <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>.  (Regular readers of <U>Feedback</U>\n\t\t\t will recall my paean to \"Angels\" a few issues back.)\n\t\t\t After \"Soul Happy Hour,\" Pat sang a couple of lines\n\t\t\t from \"The Sandman,\" and then broke into \"Angels.\"\n\t\t\t  I was ecstatic.  Superlatives fail me.  In the verse that begins,\n\t\t\t \"I can see them...\" he added the lines, \"They're\n\t\t\t up in heaven...I know because I've been there.\"  Possibly\n\t\t\t the closest thing I've ever had to an orgasmic musical experience.\n\t\t\t  Wow.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Kevin Haskins joined the band on drums, wearing\n\t\t\t a black shirt, with black hair in a sort of quiff.  Pat Fish\n\t\t\t picked up the string of fish I had thrown onstage earlier, held\n\t\t\t it up and said \"Thanks for the fish,\" then put it in\n\t\t\t the pocket of his suit coat.  He introduced the next song as\n\t\t\t about being on \"the wrong side of the Carpathians\"\n\t\t\t - \"The Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula.\"  Toward the\n\t\t\t end of the song, Pat's amp stopped working.  The roadies came\n\t\t\t up on stage and started trying to fix it.  People were yelling\n\t\t\t out song titles and suggestions.  Someone said he should play\n\t\t\t through Max's amp and Pat said, \"You don't want me coming\n\t\t\t through there,\" and Max looked horrified and shook his head.\n\t\t\t  Someone else said, \"Break up,\" and Pat said, \"We\n\t\t\t tried that.\"  After the same person yelled about four song\n\t\t\t titles, Pat said, \"Honey, I'd be happy to be able to play\n\t\t\t you ANY FUCKING THING right now.\"  He then announced that\n\t\t\t they would take a short break while \"the Cathy and Rob show\"\n\t\t\t tried to fix the amp, and then more or less ran off stage, very\n\t\t\t exasperated.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Eventually, the roadies got the fuse changed\n\t\t\t in the amp, possibly the only time I've ever participated in\n\t\t\t an ovation for roadies.  Incidentally, the crowd at the show\n\t\t\t was one of the most good-humored and positive crowds I've ever\n\t\t\t been in.  Clearly everyone was there because they really wanted\n\t\t\t to be, and most of the audience seemed to know most of the songs.\n\t\t\t  One person kept yelling, \"Stop mucking about!\" but\n\t\t\t I think they thought they were being funny.  After the second\n\t\t\t or third time, Pat said, \"Go see a band that didn't break\n\t\t\t up four years ago.\"  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Pat came back onstage without his suit jacket\n\t\t\t and said something about having his coat off now.  They played\n\t\t\t \"She's on Drugs\" and \"Mr. Odd,\" two of my\n\t\t\t favorites from 1990's <U>Cult of the Basement</U>.  Pat then\n\t\t\t introduced \"Walk With the Devil\" as \"having been\n\t\t\t written during the Cold War, when writing about St. Petersburg\n\t\t\t was supposed to be ironic.\"  They played \"President\n\t\t\t Reagan's Birthday Present\" and \"Caroline Wheeler's\n\t\t\t Birthday Present.\"  Then Max played his song \"The Long\n\t\t\t Night Starts,\" which was quite lovely.  Pat sang a verse\n\t\t\t of \"Purple Rain\" as the intro to \"Rain,\"\n\t\t\t a song that I'd never heard, yet which sounded oddly familiar.\n\t\t\t  Next was \"Girlfriend,\" another favorite of mine -\n\t\t\t \"Well, it's funny cause I thought that it could have turned\n\t\t\t out quite romantic/But it isn't like that, which is fine, cause\n\t\t\t it means I can stand it.\"  At some point in here, someone\n\t\t\t brought a beer up to the stage and tried to hand it to Pat. \n\t\t\t He had his back turned to the audience and Max Eider tapped him\n\t\t\t on the arm and said, \"Pat, someone's trying to give you\n\t\t\t a drink.\"  Pat introduced \"Old Snakey,\" from 1995's\n\t\t\t <U>Illuminate</U>, as being from \"a record that never even\n\t\t\t got released over here,\" and referred to it as \"a newer\n\t\t\t old song.\"  He made great snake movements with his hands\n\t\t\t while he was singing it.  His moves were great - he danced and\n\t\t\t did great stuff with his feet while he played, and ended a couple\n\t\t\t of songs with Max standing up and Pat falling to his knees at\n\t\t\t the end of the song.  It sounds clich&eacute; when I describe\n\t\t\t it, but it looked very spontaneous, natural and cool while they\n\t\t\t were doing it. \"Bigfoot Motel\" was next, followed by\n\t\t\t \"Zombie Love,\" which Pat introduced as being in \"the\n\t\t\t saddest of all keys, A minor.\"  I found myself liking the\n\t\t\t goofier songs a lot more when I saw and heard them being played\n\t\t\t live.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>After \"Zombie Love,\" the band left\n\t\t\t the stage and returned, after much applause, to play a cover\n\t\t\t of Camper Van Beethoven's \"Take the Skinheads Bowling,\"\n\t\t\t which Pat dedicated to \"my close personal friend Curtis\n\t\t\t E. Johnson,\" in whose band, the Stranger Tractors, Pat Fish\n\t\t\t plays drums.  They left the stage again, and returned again.\n\t\t\t  Pat sang a verse I didn't recognize about \"a thing of beauty\n\t\t\t is a joy forever,\" and then said that the next song was\n\t\t\t about a particular section of highway outside Northampton, Pat's\n\t\t\t home.  He then said, \"It's not what you think,\" and\n\t\t\t chanted the \"One-two-three-four-five-six!\" intro to\n\t\t\t the very special Jazz Butcher version of Jonathan Richman's \"Roadrunner\"\n\t\t\t with a section about \"Maximilian Eider did not know it,\n\t\t\t but he was entering the Twilight Zone/That's where he went/Said\n\t\t\t I wouldn't live next door to one if I were you...Rock and roll\n\t\t\t vegetable live next door to you/Rock and roll vegetable, vegetable\n\t\t\t stew/Roadrunner, roadrunner...\"</P>\n\t\t\t<P>This ended the show.  I went over to Jerry\n\t\t\t and Sophie.  Sophie immediately said, \"I loved him, he's\n\t\t\t so cute!\" which would have made her my friend for life,\n\t\t\t except that she already is.  Jerry said that I looked so ecstatic\n\t\t\t that he thought my facial muscles were going to cramp up from\n\t\t\t smiling (they did get sore toward the end of the show, but it\n\t\t\t was a small price to pay.)  Part of me wanted to stay and try\n\t\t\t to meet Pat Fish, and part of me was scared to, and Sophie wanted\n\t\t\t to go home, and so we left.</P>"},{"gigtext_id":261,"datetime":"1999-09-23T20:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Scott Deschaine","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Here's a feeble attempt to convey the thrill that was the Jazz Butcher\n\t\t\tConspiracy show at the Wetlands in New York City on September 23, 1999. I hope\n\t\t\tit gives a small vicarious thrill to those who couldn't make it. And for those\n\t\t\twho could have come, but had some lame reason for not attending, I hope it\n\t\t\tmakes you kick yourself.....\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Wetlands itself is an open, clean, spacious yet informal club. This place\n\t\t\tdonates all profits to environmental and political causes. There is an actual\n\t\t\tVW Bus coming out of one wall, complete with resident hippie girl passing out\n\t\t\tpolitical literature for a variety of good and questionable causes.\n\t\t\tVentilation of the club was great. The beer selection was good, if expensive,\n\t\t\tbut hey, some of that money's going to protect the environment! Give me\n\t\t\tanother, I'm saving the planet!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGot there early, and got to meet Mr. Pat Fish! He's taller than expected (6'\n\t\t\t2\"-4\"?). He courteously chatted with a variety of fans and admirers before the\n\t\t\topening act. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe crowd was mixed - young and old, male and female. Surprised at how many\n\t\t\tearly twenty-somethings were there, and how many I talked with liked The\n\t\t\tButcher's older stuff. How did they hear it?? One gent told me his first\n\t\t\texposure to the Jazz Butcher's music was hearing \"Big Questions\" used as a\n\t\t\ttheme song for a television show that reviewed music CDs! Anyone know the name\n\t\t\tof this show and other details?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere was a short set by an opening band. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMr. Pat Fish and Mr. Max Eider took the stage. Pat said, \"Welcome to the last\n\t\t\tgreat rock concert of the century!\" And then they began gently playing what\n\t\t\tthey called their \"pussy\" songs. \"Partytime\" was first. Over succeeding songs,\n\t\t\tPat and Max were joined by Mr. Owen Jones, <span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a>\n\t</span><!-- person --> (who Pat later\n\t\t\tthanked for, among other things, driving the van and being his attorney!), and\n\t\t\tanother gent whose name I missed but who flew in from England just to play\n\t\t\twith the band that night.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor those who care, to me the sound mix was fantastic, perfect. But to be\n\t\t\thonest, these guys could have been playing oatmeal boxes and kyotos and I'd\n\t\t\thave found no fault.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEarly in the show, the gents traded instruments around for different songs. On\n\t\t\tOwen's sad song \"<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Don't Let Me Keep You</i>\n\t<span class=\"song_author\">(<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/owen_jones.html\">Owen Jones</a>\n\t</span><!-- person -->)</span>\n\t</span>,\" Pat played bass. Some of the other\n\t\t\tquieter songs included \"Raking Up the Leaves,\" \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\" and\n\t\t\t\"The Long Night Starts.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd then they started getting wound up. Don't quote me on the exact order of\n\t\t\tthe songs, but along came \"Falling in Love,\" \"She's On Drugs,\" \"Soul Happy\n\t\t\tHour,\" \"D.R.I.N.K.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYou may have heard \"Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula\" before, but you never\n\t\t\theard it like these guys played it that night. Roaring along, full of sound,\n\t\t\tall cylinders hitting, fun and scary at the same time! These guys mean it!\n\t\t\tAlmost appropriately, Pat's guitar fritzed out at the end of the song. Even\n\t\t\tthe equipment was not prepared for how this band was reaching critical mass!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA quick break to fix the equipment. Good - a chance to squeeze through the\n\t\t\tcrowd for one of those beers and help support the environment some more. Then\n\t\t\tthe band was back on stage, ready to go again.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax Eider sat off to the right, in full concentration, looking up once in a\n\t\t\twhile with a smile. Several times as the show heated up, he stood and walked\n\t\t\taround, seemingly moved by the music and quite enjoying himself. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOwen Jones and <span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a>\n\t</span><!-- person --> provided a driving, solid beat, adding OOMPH to\n\t\t\tsongs that deserve it. Some live performances can't live up to recorded\n\t\t\tversions, but I've never heard some of these songs sound so rocking and full\n\t\t\tof life!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd there's Pat Fish, center stage. Singing and playing guitar with control,\n\t\t\tthen letting go with wild abandon, then pulling it all together again. Proudly\n\t\t\tshowing off the talents of the gents around him. And delivering those great\n\t\t\tsongs, one after another. Pat Fish, looking like a natural.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe place was packed, hardly enough room to even move! As the show went on you\n\t\t\tcould see ever increasing numbers of people begin to move with the music. At\n\t\t\tfirst, maybe only die-hard Butcher fans, but then more and more, until those\n\t\t\tstanding still were a small number indeed!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhat's that? A rousing \"President Reagan's Birthday Present\" that segues into\n\t\t\ta pounding version of \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" OKAY!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Rain\" - Alright!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Walk With the Devil\"\n\t\t\t\"Girlfriend\"\n\t\t\t\"Mr. Odd\" \n\t\t\t\"Bigfoot Motel\" - THEY KEEP COMING!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Forever\" (\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever...\") - sigh - too true!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSIDE NOTE - Not many songs were played from some of the more recent JBC\n\t\t\trecords and no SUMOSONIC tunes. From ILLUMINATE, only \"Old Snakey.\" This is a\n\t\t\tflat out horror story of a song - get that shocker ending!!  On stage, this\n\t\t\thad a galloping, jerky quality quite different from the slithering riotousness\n\t\t\tof the album version. When introducing the song, Pat made some comment about\n\t\t\tSony deciding not to release ILLUMINATE in the U.S. - talk about a horror\n\t\t\tstory! What's the deal there? Anyone know why they chose not to release this\n\t\t\tmonster of a disc?? \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Angels\" - HIT THE CEILING! Why that girl over there is actually crying! Who\n\t\t\tcan blame her??\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Zombie Love\" - YEAH GO! These guys are out of control! This song just\n\t\t\tCOULDN'T sound so menacing and driving, but it does!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFirst encore - \"Take the Skinheads Bowling.\" \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSecond encore - \"Roadrunner.\" The whole place was bouncing. Even people who\n\t\t\tjust sat along the back rail for the whole show jumped into the mass of\n\t\t\tdancing and shouting.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI've never seen the Jazz Butcher before - never even thought I'd get the\n\t\t\tchance! My sincere thanks to all who helped make this tour possible.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNot much comment on the list after this show and the end of the tour. Maybe\n\t\t\ttoo many mixed emotions.

September 23, 1999.</h2>\n\t\t\t<b>SPECIAL REPORT  and PHOTOS by  WILSON NEATE</b><p>\n\t\t\tThis gig was billed as \"THE LAST SHOW EVER!\" for the Jazz Butcher and\n\t\t\tat the risk of sounding overly millennial and apocalyptic, I do hope that\n\t\t\tby the time the dust settles on the history of rock, sorting the men from\n\t\t\tthe boy bands, Pat Fish will have been recognized as one of the Great\n\t\t\tBritish songwriters alongside such luminaries as Ray Davies.  The total\n\t\t\tValue-For-Money experience of the Jazz Butcher live, coupled with a decade's\n\t\t\tworth of consistently fine recordings, make you wonder how on earth it is\n\t\t\tthat Pat Fish still remains a marginal entity, his status bordering on that\n\t\t\tmost horrible of all rock cliches: the well kept secret, the, ahem, cult figure.<p>\n\n\t\t\tBut never mind, I come to praise The Jazz Butcher not to bury him/them.\n\t\t\tBesides, as Mr Fish himself pointed out last night, this band has been around\n\t\t\tthe block more than a few times already and actually split up four years\n\t\t\tago anyway; and given the reception that they got from a packed house of\n\t\t\tJazz Butcher Conspirators of all stripes, I suspect that they'll be back\n\t\t\tsometime next century.  Indeed, The Jazz Butcher draws a very eclectic,\n\t\t\tboy/girl crowd these days: suits and ties straight from their law offices,\n\t\t\tyounger indie enthusiasts who missed out on the 80s but who have a sense\n\t\t\tof history and taste, and, of course, heavy drinkers of all persuasions,\n\t\t\tshapes and hairstyles came together to sing along to two hours of the greatest hits.<p>\n\n\t\t\tWhether or not it was the last show ever, it was certainly the last show\n\t\t\ton their current North American tour, for which Fish has reenlisted his\n\t\t\tvery able former cohorts: ex-Bauhaus and Love and Rockets drummer Kevin\n\t\t\tHaskins, multi-instrumentalist Owen Jones and, of course, guitar maestro Max Eider.<p>\n\n\t\t\tThings got off to an unexpected start as this reviewer was granted his completely\n\t\t\tpathetic 15, er, seconds of fame when the Butcher opened the proceedings\n\t\t\tby introducing him to the crowd as England football celebrity and husband\n\t\t\tof Posh Spice, David Beckham.  The moral of this very short story is, if\n\t\t\tyou've got blond hair and are wearing a Manchester United football jersey,\n\t\t\tdo not stand too close to the stage when someone with wits as sharp as the\n\t\t\tButcher's is on the prowl.  It being an American audience, though, I don't\n\t\t\tthink that anyone really got the joke - I mean, people actually applauded\n\t\t\tand I even gave a polite, yet awkward, wave of recognition to play along.<p>\n\n\t\t\tBut enough about me, Pat Fish and Max Eider set the festive tone for the\n\t\t\tevening, kicking things off as a duo with, not surprisingly, <i>Partytime</i>\n\t\t\t from 1983's <i>Bath of Bacon.</i>  What followed was a two-hour-plus set\n\t\t\twith (and occasionally without) the rest of the band mapping out the finest\n\t\t\tmoments in the JB catalogue, except <i>Southern Mark Smith</i> curiously\n\t\t\tenough, despite the relentless shouting of requests for it.  But then we\n\t\t\tgot to hear pretty much everything else.<p>\n\n\t\t\tNevertheless, the set was truncated by a 20 minute intermission when Fish's\n\t\t\tguitar amp chose a particularly inappropriate time to call it a day.  Consequently,\n\t\t\tthe band retreated from the stage to regroup, the Butcher himself visibly\n\t\t\tfrustrated and uncharacteristically flustered; still, it was a special occasion,\n\t\t\t"},{"gigtext_id":264,"datetime":"2000-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"A.

I spent a lot of time looking at my notes and saying,\n\t\t\t\"What?\" \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm moving back to Lansing, Michigan next month, so this was probably the last\n\t\t\tconcert I'll see for a while - and what a great concert it was!   This was the\n\t\t\tfirst time I'd ever been to TT the Bear's.  It had a much nicer vibe than the\n\t\t\tMiddle East - friendlier employees and a nicer layout.  There's a wide entry\n\t\t\thall between the two sides of the club.  At the rear of the hall are the\n\t\t\tbathrooms.  Off the left side of the hall is the bar, with seating at the far\n\t\t\tside of it and a small room with a pool table to the left of the bathrooms. \n\t\t\tOff the right side of the hall is the stage area, with the stage at the front\n\t\t\tand the sound booth at the back.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI had thought about going to the show late, since there were three opening\n\t\t\tbands, but I got too antsy and ended up getting there a little before nine.  I\n\t\t\twas glad I did, because when I arrived, the club was nearly empty, and Pat and\n\t\t\tKathie were just standing around at the merchandise table.  I got to talk to\n\t\t\tthem a bit and got Pat to sign my Condition Blue CD insert.  Pat said, \"I like\n\t\t\tpeople who bring their own Sharpies.\"  (I always carry a Sharpie - you never\n\t\t\tknow when you're going to need to graffiti something.)  Pat said something\n\t\t\tabout not being sure what they were going to play, as it was the first show of\n\t\t\tthe tour.  I lobbied unsuccessfully for \"Racheland.\"  Forgot to mention that on\n\t\t\tApril 13, 1796, the first elephant arrived in America.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe first band, Device, introduced themselves as being \"English, like the Jazz\n\t\t\tButcher Conspiracy,\" and kept talking about how their music was drum and bass,\n\t\t\t\"so we'd all be able to recognize it when it came over here.\"  Okay.  One of\n\t\t\tthe guitarists looked like a young Mark E. Smith.  The second band, the Shelley\n\t\t\tWinters Project, had a violinist, a guitarist who was too cute and knew it, and\n\t\t\ta keyboard player/vocalist who introduced the band by saying \"We're not Devo.\" \n\t\t\tIt's true, they aren't Devo, although the singer had that Church of the\n\t\t\tSubgenius vibe.  They were reasonably amusing.  At this point a guy came up to\n\t\t\tme and asked me if I was a writer.  He was from Your Sound, a web site which\n\t\t\twas supposedly \"sponsoring\" the show.  I don't know what that consisted of,\n\t\t\tother than having a rather ugly banner hanging on the back wall of the stage. \n\t\t\tThen he wanted to know if I wanted to write for their web site.  I accepted a\n\t\t\tbusiness card and he went away.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd then it was AEUK time!  (This now seems to be the \"official\" name of the\n\t\t\tband - or at least they introduced themselves as AEUK, not Ass Eaters UK.) \n\t\t\tThey've got a new singer, who can actually sing - she had kind of a\n\t\t\tplatinum-haired Barbie doll New York look.  I thought they were better than\n\t\t\tthey were at last fall's Wetlands show, although they drove most of the\n\t\t\taudience into the bar.  They did a cover of \"Tie Your Mother Down\" by Queen, so\n\t\t\tI'll give them points for that.  \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEarlier in the evening, Pat and Max had carried a couple of the barstools\n\t\t\tacross to the side of the stage, and Pat now brought them onstage.  Owen\n\t\t\tstarted setting up his drums, Pat and Kathie were unsnarling guitar cords, Max\n\t\t\twas positioning his effects box. Then everyone went off and Pat and Max\n\t\t\treappeared, wearing sunglasses - Max's were reddish-brown and oval, Pat's were\n\t\t\tretro-shaped and silvery.  When I saw them in NYC last year, Max was at the\n\t\t\textreme right of the stage and Pat was at the center, in front of the drums. \n\t\t\tThis time their positions were reversed, with Pat at the extreme right of the\n\t\t\tstage. They seated themselves, and after a bit of a struggle with the reverb on\n\t\t\tPat's amp - he said something about sounding like Chrissie Hynde - they played\n\t\t\t\"Partytime.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHere's a phenomenon I don't understand: when Pat and Max were walking around\n\t\t\tthe club together, Max seemed shorter than Pat, but when they're both onstage\n\t\t\ttogether, Max is taller.  Can anyone explain this?  Both Pat and Max wore dark\n\t\t\tsuits, Max with a black polo-neck shirt and Doc Martens, Pat with a white knit\n\t\t\tcollarless button-neck shirt and black boots. Pat was playing a black Fender\n\t\t\twith a Schwa alien head and a Sumo sticker.  After \"Partytime,\" Owen joined\n\t\t\tthem, wearing black jeans and t-shirt, and seated himself.  Pat then pulled out\n\t\t\tsome drink tickets and asked if anyone in the audience would go and get them a\n\t\t\tcouple of beers.  A guy near the right-hand side of the stage was dispatched\n\t\t\tfor three Rolling Rocks, and Pat then said, \"That's the last we'll see of him.\" \n\t\t\tHowever, he reappeared, beers in hand, during the next tune, \"Girls Who Keep\n\t\t\tGoldfish,\" with Owen on accordion.  (Later someone kept bringing Pat bottles of\n\t\t\tBass ale.)  Pat said something about getting slower as you get older.  Kathie\n\t\t\tcame up and sat at the drum kit to provide backing vocals and percussion for\n\t\t\tthe next couple of songs.  They played Max's song, \"Baby It's You,\" which he\n\t\t\treferred to as \"being called 'Baby, Baby, Baby' or something like that.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPat removed his shades and switched to bass.  There was a persistent buzzing\n\t\t\tfrom one of the amps at the left-hand side of the stage, and he said, \"Love\n\t\t\tthat buzz!\"  One of the audience members responded, \"Waiting for the Love\n\t\t\tBuzz!\" to which Pat sternly replied, \"That's as bad as one of mine.\"  Owen\n\t\t\tplayed guitar and sang his lovely, sad song \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\"  Then\n\t\t\tKathie left the stage, Owen moved to the drums and Pat took up the guitar,\n\t\t\tsaying, \"It's like progressive rock, all this instrument swapping.\"  He then\n\t\t\tintroduced \"DRINK,\" with Max on vocals, by saying, \"It's cabaret time.\" \n\t\t\tAfterward he said, \"You should see us down the library.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSteve Valentine then joined the band on bass, standing at the left-hand side of\n\t\t\tthe stage.  Max sang, \"Who Loves You Now?\"  Next was \"Girlfriend,\" a favorite\n\t\t\tof mine, with some very fierce guitar at the end and Pat shaking his hair\n\t\t\tabout.  He introduced \"Mr. Odd\" by saying, \"This next number's not necessarily\n\t\t\tone you'd associate with this collection of individuals...\" Max stood up to\n\t\t\tplay \"Mr. Odd,\" which was followed by \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" \n\t\t\tPat then paused to tune his guitar, saying something about sounding like\n\t\t\tSpacemen 3, and then began \"Soul Happy Hour\" by singing, \"The best things in\n\t\t\tlife are free, but you can give them to Spacemen 3.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax then sang a new song, a fast rocking number called \"Rose Marie.\"  Pat\n\t\t\tintroduced the next song as being set in New Orleans on a 48-hour drinking\n\t\t\tbinge, \"where I met a lovely girl that became my girlfriend.\"  The song was\n\t\t\t\"Sweet Water,\" off of Waiting for the Love Bus, a delicious surprise.  \"She's\n\t\t\tOn Drugs\" was next, followed by a new song which Max sang, \"Diamorphine.\"  Max\n\t\t\tcommented, \"Old age is not for sissies,\" before he started the song, which was\n\t\t\tone of the highlights of the show.  My notes say, \"Pat heavy distorted guitar\n\t\t\tYES!\"  I think I cried a little, and I know the big goofy grin showed up on my\n\t\t\tace around here.  Pat mentioned that their new LP was to be called Rotten\n\t\t\tSoul, and sang another new song, \"Niagara,\" which was also excellent. \n\t\t\tAfterward Pat said, \"We should be pretty good at that round about Iowa,\" at\n\t\t\twhich the guy behind me announced that he was from Iowa City.  Pat then asked\n\t\t\tfor a show of hands from anyone who was NOT from Iowa City.  He then used, \"Be\n\t\t\tvery careful while traveling through the Midwest...\" as the introduction to\n\t\t\t\"Bigfoot Motel.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThey didn't play \"Racheland,\" but Pat introduced the next one as \"a song about\n\t\t\tjust how shitty things can get around the home,\" and they played \"She's a\n\t\t\tYo-Yo\" from Condition Blue.   This was an excellent ending to an excellent set. \n\t\t\tThe band left the stage and the house lights came up, but they returned for a\n\t\t\tvery fast encore of \"Take The Skinheads Bowling.\"  (Earlier Pat had commented\n\t\t\ton seeing the time in big glowing orange numbers on the clock across from the\n\t\t\tstage.)   Closing times in Cambridge are very early.

I won't bother with a long \n\t\t\treview, as it's all pretty much been said about the other shows so far, but \n\t\t\tit was great.  I think I preferred seeing them in the MIT over a club like \n\t\t\tLaga.  The small room created a much more intimate atmosphere, and was \n\t\t\tplenty of space for everyone that came.  Sound quality was good, the only \n\t\t\tlow point being \"She's a Yo-Yo\", when the vocals were so low in the mix \n\t\t\tthat they couldn't really be heard.  I didn't get the set list, but I think \n\t\t\tit was about the same as has been posted so far.  They played for about an \n\t\t\thour and twenty minutes total, not counting the breaks between encores.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnyway, I wanted to throw in my comments on the merchandise.  There were, \n\t\t\tof course, the CDs.  I picked up Max's album, I'd forgotten how good it is \n\t\t\t(it's been a long time since I've listened to my vinyl copy).  The shirts I \n\t\t\tfound to be rather disappointing.  There were three t-shirt designs . . \n\t\t\t.  One that just had \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" written in sort of a \n\t\t\thexagon thing (this was also available in a \"baseball\" shirt with red \n\t\t\tsleeves).  Really boring.  One with a photo of the band from 1984 and the \n\t\t\tcaption \"I thought it had stopped -- JBC 1984\".  This was the best of them, \n\t\t\tso I picked it up, though I would have much preferred one that actually \n\t\t\tsaid \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" on it.  Then there was one with the \n\t\t\tGlorious and Idiotic logo on it, but for some reason it also had AEUK \n\t\t\tplastered all over it.  If it weren't for that, I would probably have \n\t\t\tbought this one, but since I didn't really care for AEUK, it was out.  None \n\t\t\tof the t-shirts seemed particularly well printed.  Then there were the polo \n\t\t\tshirts, but I've never been particularly into polo shirts, and the concept \n\t\t\tof one with a band logo on it just seems really odd to me, so I didn't \n\t\t\treally look at them.  It's a shame the shirts weren't better done -- I \n\t\t\twould have been more than happy to pay more for a better printed one with a \n\t\t\tbetter design on it.

I didn't get home until\n\t\t\t2:30 so I'm paying for it today, but they're worth it.\n\t\t\tThe club was nice.  I had never been there before.  It's upstairs from a\n\t\t\tbowling alley.  It's pretty small, and it's half pool hall and half\n\t\t\talternative-rock club.  There's a good size dance floor, and there are\n\t\t\ttables behind the dance floor, and on platforms on either side.  We sat at a\n\t\t\ttable near the front of one platform.  At one point during the first band,\n\t\t\tPat Fish and Max Eider sat down in front of us on the platform itself (not\n\t\t\tin chairs).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI probably won't get the song titles right, but here goes.  They started out\n\t\t\twith just Pat and Max doing It's Party Time and Girls Who Keep Goldfish.\n\t\t\tThen they were joined on stage by an accordion player whose last name was\n\t\t\tJones (didn't catch his first name) who later turned out to be the drummer.\n\t\t\tThey did a couple songs like that, then Jones played guitar and sang one\n\t\t\tsong that was beautiful... it might be called I Won't Keep You or something\n\t\t\tlike that.  Then the bass player came out and the whole band was in place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThey played for about an hour and a half.  Their songs are so great!!  There\n\t\t\twas a cool song that mentioned Michael Jackson, but unfortunately I don't\n\t\t\tremember any of the other lyrics.  There was another song that had the word\n\t\t\tgirlfriend in the chorus a lot, and that was another really good one.  Some\n\t\t\tothers that I remember are Niagara, Sex and Travel, Sweetwater, Mr. Odd,\n\t\t\tGirl-Go.  They did a couple songs that Pat said were new, and I think the\n\t\t\tnames were Daughter Morphine and Come On Marie.  Come On Marie sounded\n\t\t\tMotown-ish, and Pat said he was excited about playing it in Detroit.  He\n\t\t\tmentioned several times that he likes Detroit a lot.  He was really funny\n\t\t\tbetween songs.  At one point they were having equipment problems and Pat\n\t\t\tleft the stage & returned with a notebook which must have been his tour\n\t\t\tjournal.  He told us how many eggs the band has eaten during the tour &\n\t\t\tstuff like that.  Despite the equipment problems, they looked like they were\n\t\t\thaving a lot of fun.  There weren't a whole lot of people there, but those\n\t\t\twho were there really liked the band, were yelling out song titles, etc.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMost people stood in front of the stage.

Then they left the\n\t\t\tstage, and people were still making a lot of noise, so they came back for\n\t\t\tanother encore.  I don't know what it was, but it was excellent.  My friend\n\t\t\tKaren liked them a lot, and wants to get some of their CD's (if she can find\n\t\t\tthem).\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe art gallery show was fun too.

This was the\n\t\t\tfirst show I have attended at Shuba's, and it was a real treat to see Pat\n\t\t\tand the boys in such a small, intimate venue.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI arrived at 10:00, about one hour after the show started.  I was pleased\n\t\t\tto see the sign on the door \"Tonight's Show Sold Out\".  At Shuba's that\n\t\t\tmeant a crowd of approximately 250-300.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tArriving late, I missed AEUK (thanks to Doc, who informed me I was lucky to\n\t\t\thave missed it.  It was great to meet another list member in the flesh).\n\t\t\tAt about 10:15 the next act came on, Mezodigm.  They were what you would\n\t\t\texpect from an opening band.  Not the best I've seen, not the worst I've\n\t\t\tseen, but an opening band.  They sounded like a cross between Syd Barrett\n\t\t\tand Catherine Wheel, a wall of noise with meaningless lyricks.  The best\n\t\t\tpart was when an audience member yelled \"What does Mezodigm mean?\", to\n\t\t\twhich the singer merely scowled.  After the set, I had a chance to ask the\n\t\t\tsame question to the bass player while in line for the \"facilities\", and he\n\t\t\tchuckled and said \"I get in trouble when I tell people it means 'a\n\t\t\thalf-assed paradigm'\".  That was a better reply than the singer's.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFinally, at about 11:30, Pat and Max hit the stage, both wearing black, and\n\t\t\tboth donning their sunglasses.  They launched into Partytime and, unlike\n\t\t\tthe San Francisco show, rapidly escalated into faster and louder songs,\n\t\t\twith the entire band on stage by the fourth or fifth song.  When Pat\n\t\t\tintroduced Steve Valentine, he referred to him as \"Son of Chicago, Attorney\n\t\t\tat Law and Bad-Ass-Mother-F*cker\".  I did not record the set list, but it\n\t\t\twas basically identical to the lists posted for other shows on the tour.\n\t\t\tThe sound was very good, not excellent like in San Francisco.  Also, the\n\t\t\tmix of songs tended to focus, especially as the show headed into the early\n\t\t\tmorning hours, on the faster rockers (She's a Yo-Yo comes to mind).  The\n\t\t\tthree songs from their forthcoming album were fantastic.  Normally I'm\n\t\t\tbored stiff when a band plays songs I have not heard before, but these\n\t\t\talready sounded like old friends.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe T-shirts looked cheap, like they would fit a GI Joe action figure if\n\t\t\tlaundered.  One style featured a 1984 photo of Pat, Max and Owen from the\n\t\t\tcover of (I think, I don't have it so I'm going on memory) The Gift of\n\t\t\tMusic.  The other style featured a heptagon (that's a seven-sided figure,\n\t\t\tfor the geometrically challenged) with the letters JBC in the center.  I\n\t\t\tpassed on those, but did pick up a Max Eider CD for $15.  It seemed like a\n\t\t\tlot of people were scooping up Max CDs and G&I CDs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the end of the regular set the band stood off to the side of the stage\n\t\t\tfor about 30 seconds before returning for their first encore.  Pat and Max\n\t\t\twere having a good chuckle over this, because the side of the stage was in\n\t\t\tplain view to everyone, and it was quite obvious they weren't going\n\t\t\tanywhere.  They played two encores, both short (two or so songs, I cannot\n\t\t\tremember exactly).  The crowd really glommed onto Take the Skinheads Bowling.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAll in all, an excellent evening.  The audience was very deep into the\n\t\t\tmusic.  Even during the \"quieter\" songs, the crowd was intensely listening,\n\t\t\twith very little conversation noise.  The whole band seemed to really\n\t\t\tappreciate the reception.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAdditional treat.  Pat and Max will be playing an intimate \"semi-acoustic\"\n\t\t\tset at a club called Danny's tonight.  Alas, my wife and son would not\n\t\t\tlikely look upon my attendance favorably."},{"gigtext_id":276,"datetime":"2000-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Doc","credit_url":"blueaero@yahoo.com","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Danny's is a small bar on Dickens Ave. in the Bucktown section of Chicago. \n\t\t\tIt's an old two-flat building (meaning there's two apartments, one on top of\n\t\t\tthe other).  The main bar is in the front room, off the main entrance.  There\n\t\t\tare little rooms on the main and second floors.  The bar is in an area the size\n\t\t\tof an average living room.  The next room is the main lounge, and it's roughly\n\t\t\tthe same size as the bar.  The band played in that room.  It was Pat, Max, and\n\t\t\tMister Jones (Steve Valentine was in attendance but didn't play).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhy were JBC playing there?  Mostly because the owner of the bar is a huge JBC\n\t\t\tfan.  Last year when the the JBC played the Wetlands, the owner of the bar flew\n\t\t\tto New York, saw the show, met the band, and made the offer that if they came\n\t\t\tthrough Chicago at anytime on any future tour, leave an extra day open in\n\t\t\tChicago.

I was catatonically drunk, but I remember that their set was as satisfying as the turn-out was depressing. Future hot-shit indie-frauds Death Cab for Cutie opened the show, and there were maybe fifteen people there specifically to see them. It was a complete bath for the club, Im sure, as the audience never numbered more than 25, and at least ten of those I know to have gotten in for free. So Death Cabs fifteen fans, who were all either seventeen years old or named Amber Townsend, left as soon as they finished. Death Cab also decided to leave as quickly as possible, trying to duck out before the Jazz Butcher even took the stage. When the club understandably gave Death Cab less money than they expected, members of the band apparently pitched a (no doubt very sensitive) hissy fit. Im not sure what was said, or if there was any physical contact, but whatever happened led to Death Cab being banned from the 40 Watt for almost four years. A year later Ben Gibbard briefly recounted the affair in that horrible Devil in the Woods magazine, and seemed to feel legitimately ashamed about his actions. I didnt witness the altercation, but throughout their performance, and up until the point when they left (attracting as much attention as they could from a crowd of ten), they were visibly pissed about the turn-out, and looked like theyd rather be anywhere else. This was in early 2000, right after their second album had been released, and well before they attained any notable national fame. They didnt have any reason to expect a good turn-out, and their actions made them look like presumptuous assholes.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher, meanwhile, who had much more of a right to be upset, having come all the way from England, took everything in stride. Instead of complaining or moping he addressed the situation the only way men should, with humor and alcohol. He and the Conspiracy (or whatever they were calling themselves then) put on a good, highly entertaining show, and the few of us who gave a shit about them had a damn good time. If the guys in Death Cab had stayed they would have learned something about professionalism, and/or how not to be pathetic dicks.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI got hooked on the Jazz Butcher when I was twelve, thanks to Rich Halls old Onion World program on the original Comedy Channel. Hall had lots of good bands on that program - del Amitri, the Trashcan Sinatras, Big Dipper - but the Jazz Butcher was the most prominent, and the best. Partytime and Southern Mark Smith are two of my favorite songs by the Butcher. I used to listen to them on a tape I made by hooking our television up through the stereo. These songs come from my old vinyl copy of the Bloody Nonsense compilation, which I believe is currently out of print. They sound a lot better when the Sniglet guy isnt talking over them, thats for sure. But so there are a lot of Jazz Butcher compilations out there, and for the most part you'll probably want to stick with his early '80's stuff."},{"gigtext_id":283,"datetime":"2000-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Jay Nagy","credit_url":"https://twitter.com/ServoAcademy","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The attendance at the 40 Watt was extraordinarily sparse.

The audience had shrunk by the time AEUK came on,\n\t\t\tand no one, including me, could really make out what they were on about,\n\t\t\tbut they were gone in a flash.  Pat and Max were in a good mood and Pat\n\t\t\tthanked the audience continually.  He was making jokes about the small\n\t\t\tcrowd, when Steve joined them he threatened \"soon we will outnumber\n\t\t\tyou!\"  Pat broke a string very early on, not sure what song it was. \n\t\t\tUnlike how the Cleveland show was apparently, they didn't play\n\t\t\thalfheartedly and it was a wonderful introduction for me to JBC live. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfterwards as Owen and Steve were packing up I had them sign a flier I'd\n\t\t\tpulled off the wall.  Steve told me to go around backstage to get Pat and\n\t\t\tMax to sign it.  When I walked into the room, Pat pointed at me saying,\n\t\t\t\"I think I know who you are!\"  It turns out he'd read my \"Glorious and\n\t\t\tIdiotic\" review in the Flagpole free weekly (www.flagpole.com) and had\n\t\t\tnoticed my name when I signed up for their mailing list.  (I should\n\t\t\tmention that I didn't recognize Pat who was standing right in front of\n\t\t\tme, shows what a newbie I am!)  I was beyond flattered that he'd\n\t\t\tremembered it and me and liked what I had to say.  He signed the flier,\n\t\t\t\"thanks mate, you did your best!\" Apparently not a lot of people were\n\t\t\treally excited by my praise for the album!  Still, even though I felt bad\n\t\t\tfor them playing to such a small group, it did make the gig a bit\n\t\t\tfriendlier and relaxed.

It was certainly\n\t\t\teverything we expected and more, and worth every minute behind the wheel.\n\t\t\t Anyone who has a chance to see the NYC show should do themselves a\n\t\t\tfavor, compel all their friends to attend, and allow one of the most down\n\t\t\tto earth bands to give you a night of high quality entertainment.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe show in Philadelphia started around 9:00 or so with a local band, The\n\t\t\tTrouble with Sweeney.  They helped draw some locals to the venue and fill\n\t\t\ta large dance floor/club.  As I was downstairs in the restaurant talking\n\t\t\twith Pat and Max, I didn't get to see but one or two songs of theirs.  I\n\t\t\tthink if I wasn't there to see JBC, I may have enjoyed them.  For those\n\t\t\twho are looking for a place to do some pre-show drinking, I advise you to\n\t\t\tgo to the venue itself.   At the risk of being put in the band's\n\t\t\tdoghouse, I will tell you that they made themselves available for\n\t\t\tconversation & cocktails at the bar.  I know they must have been a little\n\t\t\tuncomfortable with the attention, not to mention that they were in a\n\t\t\tsteakhouse.  \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI felt like a kid at Christmas, to be able to talk with the fellows\n\t\t\tbefore the show.  They were having a pint with a few friends from the US,\n\t\t\tbut took the time to answer a few questions I had about the history of\n\t\t\tthe band, how the tour was organized, their songwriting techniques, and\n\t\t\toverall impression of the US and its fans.  It's so refreshing to meet\n\t\t\tmusicians who are unpretentious, polite, and accessable.  If other bands\n\t\t\tI've seen acted the same way, I'm sure they would have a more devoted\n\t\t\tfollowing.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs I headed upstairs to set up the minidisc player (Yes, I tried to tape\n\t\t\tboth shows, I'll get those interested more info later - Thank you, DJ the\n\t\t\tsound man.), I stopped at the concession booth.  Kathie, a woman of\n\t\t\tmulti-talents, was very patient in answering a few more questions I\n\t\t\tforgot to ask downstairs.  She sang backup vocals on Max's new song,\n\t\t\t\"Baby , It's You.\" & Owen's tune \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\"  When she's not\n\t\t\tdoing this, she also restrings the guitars (Pat was playing with a\n\t\t\treligious fervor), drives the band around, and helps to keep them in line\n\t\t\tand make sure things run smoothly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe four song set by AEUK was not what you'd expect at a JBC show.  If\n\t\t\tany of you have listened to the Black Eg album, you'd have a pretty good\n\t\t\tidea what they're like.  Since the drummer and bassist left the tour in\n\t\t\tChicago, they were accompanied by the Barrister of Bass, who was making a\n\t\t\tstatement on global warming by performing in a Baklava.  He must be quite\n\t\t\tpassionate about the subject, as I almost passed out in a sportshirt and\n\t\t\tshorts.  Although most of the other reviews stated that the AEUK members\n\t\t\twere inaccessable, I found the exact opposite.  I talked at great length\n\t\t\tto Chris and Scott (thanks for the T's) and they actually helped organize\n\t\t\tthe tour.  They booked the clubs, helped with the driving, setting up\n\t\t\tinstruments, etc.  Diehard JBC fans, and a pair of very nice guys. \n\t\t\tSorry, I never asked what the acronym means.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt about 10:30 the JBC took to the stage.

At an objective and sober\n\t\t\tdistance it still strikes me that this was a helluva gig.  What I thought\n\t\t\twas particularly striking was the difference between this and the Boston\n\t\t\tshow; that was good, but sometimes a little hesitant (Bigfoot Motel, She's\n\t\t\ton Drugs, Mr Odd in particular didn't sound totally \"natural\") but here,\n\t\t\tafter nearly a month on the road, everyone was so clearly more familiar and\n\t\t\tflowing with each song.  I really enjoyed the way certain songs had gained\n\t\t\tnew verses or instrumental passages, Bigfoot sounded like the \"original\"\n\t\t\tHamburg version - i.e. maniacally energetic - I thought Owen sang really\n\t\t\tstrongly on his Don't Let Me Keep You, and Mr Odd and She's on Drugs were\n\t\t\tawesome here.  Diamorphine is a great song from the new album (no wah-wah\n\t\t\tthis time, when did that drop out?) , Niagara sounded a lot stronger this\n\t\t\ttime around, the sound was very good (I swear this was one of the loudest\n\t\t\tgigs I've ever been to, but then again I was standing 3 feet from the main\n\t\t\tLH speaker) and everyone had a great time.  Pat thanked the crowd at the\n\t\t\tstart for coming out on a Tuesday night - certainly it was a good turnout\n\t\t\t(200+?) and enthusiastic too.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tExcept perhaps Steve...Owen told me afterwards that he's been having pretty\n\t\t\tbad nosebleeds for a while, which explains why he didn't come out for Zombie\n\t\t\tLove - and after the show Pat came out and a little self-consciously asked\n\t\t\tif there was a doctor in the house.  There wasn't (so what happened with the\n\t\t\tJBC drawing an educated crowd??!) so he went off to hospital.  I only hope\n\t\t\tfor his sake, and for tonight, that he's better - congratulations to his\n\t\t\tstand-in on Tuesday, who did really, really well and looked to have the time\n\t\t\tof his life - but I don't think they're all just A & G!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, if you had any doubts, if you go to one concert this year, get yourself\n\t\t\tto the Mercury tonight..."},{"gigtext_id":288,"datetime":"2000-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"woj","credit_url":"woj@smoe.org","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"couple quick thoughts on last night's hoboken show...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tgoing in, i feared that this show would too similar in vibe to last year's\n\t\t\twetlands gig or _glorious & idiotic_ -- but i needn't have worried. similar\n\t\t\tstructure, yes (start slow, build up...), but not as much of a similar\n\t\t\tsetlist as i would have expected and a really smooth pace. i think this\n\t\t\tshow was the most fluid jbc gig i've seen. it all ran together effortlessly\n\t\t\tand pat, max owen and even steve seemed to be enjoying it all very much. i\n\t\t\tsuspect the lack of a broken amp may have contributed to the state of flow.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\ti was enjoying too much to keep close notes on the setlist, but it ranged\n\t\t\tfrom the usual suspects to some unexpected treats (well, unexpected to me\n\t\t\tsince i haven't been paying close attention to the posted setlists).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tnoteworthy event: for the second song of the encore, steve, for some\n\t\t\treason, neglected to appear. pat jokingly asked for a volunteer and he got\n\t\t\twhat he asked for as one audience member hopped right up on stage and\n\t\t\tmanned the bass, professing to know both A and F. with some trepidation,\n\t\t\tthey kicked into \"zombie love\" and ... it was fantastic! the guy could play\n\t\t\tand even knew the song. pat and the unnamed bassist even did the\n\t\t\tol'guitarists-leaning-on-each-other-while-playing thang. pat, max, owen and\n\t\t\tthe audience alike were pleasantly surprised.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\ta soundboard of the show was made (not by me). if/when a copy falls in my\n\t\t\thands, i'll let y'all know."},{"gigtext_id":282,"datetime":"2000-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"John Devitofranceschi","credit_url":"john.devitofranceschi@ubsw.com","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Wow.

But please be\n\t\t\tassured it was very well-lit, well-peopled, fairly clean and without any\n\t\t\tthreatening types roaming about.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe venue is called Shinjuku Loft, and being named such, you might\n\t\t\texpect it to be on a building's upper level. Good guess, however it is\n\t\t\tactually level -2, the lowest basement level. I showed up at just after\n\t\t\t6:00, opening time and more than a little concerned since I had\n\t\t\tneglected to bother purchasing an advance ticket. I was then relieved to\n\t\t\tsee that some tickets were still available. Cost was relatively\n\t\t\tprincely, at 6500 Yen. Ouch! Well, a drop in the bucket compared to what\n\t\t\tI had shelled out for this venture. At least the price included one\n\t\t\tbeverage of my choice.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWalking down the steps to the club entrance, you can see that one side,\n\t\t\tentered to the right,  is basically a small bar with a few tables and\n\t\t\tchairs; the left entrance yields a cozy room with standing area for\n\t\t\tabout 300, a decent-sized stage (for the purpose), a small bar, and on\n\t\t\tSaturday night, a girl spinning JBC tunes on two of two turntables.\n\t\t\tImmediately to the right as you walked in (providing of course, that you\n\t\t\tactually happened to be there), Vinyl Japan had set up a counter with\n\t\t\tmost of the available JBC CD's, Max's, Dislocation Dance CD's, and...\n\t\t\tmore JBC vinyl than I had ever seen (me having seen only Big Planet\n\t\t\tScarey Planet on vinyl before). So, prepare to kick your collective\n\t\t\tselves, the following were present, and I'm sure I am forgetting some:\n\t\t\tScandal in Bohemia, Distressed Gentlefolk, JBC We Love You (?), Bath of\n\t\t\tBacon, and more I'm pretty sure. And before you ask, I didn't buy any of\n\t\t\tit, 'cept for Rotten Soul, and having bought Max's CD at Virgin earlier\n\t\t\tin the day. Also present were some JBC Japan Tour T-shirts, some JBC\n\t\t\tbuttons and Dislocation Dance T-shirts.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe crowd was... about 97% Japanese (imagine that!), and by 6:30 or so I\n\t\t\twould say more than 200 were patiently and politely milling about. Pat\n\t\t\tcame out about that time, to little fanfare, and was surrounded by small\n\t\t\tgroups who patiently waited their turn to say hello and to get various\n\t\t\titems autographed. Pat was extremely gracious, as he always seems to be,\n\t\t\tand sat on the floor signing records for 10 minutes or so.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPromptly at 7:00 the show began with Max coming out and playing some of\n\t\t\this tunes, soon to be joined by Owen on accordion. What can I say? Of\n\t\t\tcourse they both did a great job, both seeming pretty relaxed. Sound was\n\t\t\treally excellent, practically perfect in the small room, and to say\n\t\t\tyou could hear a pin drop directly after and before the tunes would not\n\t\t\tbe understatement.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax played for about 30 minutes and after a short break, Dislocation\n\t\t\tDance came on.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDislocation Dance is a U.K. group that played together in the early\n\t\t\t'80's. I was told they had not played together since 1982. Vinyl Japan\n\t\t\thad re-released their CD('s?) and brought them over from U.K. The band\n\t\t\twas comprised of your typical pop instrumentation, with a female lead\n\t\t\tvocalist and a trumpet player.  The drummer and trumpet player have been\n\t\t\tplaying together professionally since the early '80's, if not before.\n\t\t\tHope my info is correct. Anyway, they were an interesting complement to\n\t\t\tthe JBC, extremely tight, extremely polished, and the trumpet player\n\t\t\tad-libbed around their tunes all night (or at least for the 60 minutes\n\t\t\tthey played). As well, they were well-received by the crowd (which\n\t\t\tincluded various members of the JBC, from whom I gleaned most of the\n\t\t\tabove info, so speaking of which...)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI was blessed to have been in the company of Max, Owen and Pat at\n\t\t\tvarious times during the DD set, as well as Max's sister Ann, and\n\t\t\tSteve's girlfriend Linda (Steve was running about somewhere but I did\n\t\t\tnot speak with him until Sunday night -- I think). They were all quite\n\t\t\tdown-to-earth, grateful to be in Japan, happy to be there, appeciative\n\t\t\tof the crowd -- you get the picture (and speaking of which I took about\n\t\t\t50 digital photos -- a smattering of which might actually be decent and\n\t\t\tI'll send to David Whittemore for his posting disgression (okay,\n\t\t\tDavid?)).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, at around 8:45 or so the JBC came on. The playlist was what you have\n\t\t\tcome to expect from this tour. A personal new favorite of mine is now\n\t\t\tDiamorphine. There was a bit of banter with the crowd, and some banter\n\t\t\tback, especially from the handful of, I believe, Japan-based Canadians\n\t\t\tthat were jumping about in some contrast to the polite and\n\t\t\tjumping-about-to-a-lesser-extent Japanese crowd. I adhered myself to the\n\t\t\tfringe of the westerners group, or perhaps more specifically to Ann, and\n\t\t\ta good time was had by all. And so I guess I did not make too much of a\n\t\t\tspectacle of myself since Ann and Linda (and the band) were still\n\t\t\tspeaking to me by the time the Sunday show rolled around. And perhaps I\n\t\t\thad been the subject of some post-show conversation on Saturday since on\n\t\t\tSunday it was known to the band that I indeed trekked over from China\n\t\t\t(hey, it's only a 3.5 hour flight and I wasn't doing anything else of\n\t\t\tnote last weekend). Pat, whom I had not given my name, came up to me\n\t\t\tSunday and said \"you must be Ray from China.\""},{"gigtext_id":281,"datetime":"2000-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Ray","credit_url":"rlkoke@public1.tpt.tj.cn","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Early afternoon before the show on Sunday, I went to Vinyl Japan -- the\n\t\t\tband had gone there on Saturday. Actually there are 3 separate parts or\n\t\t\tshops (4?) of Vinyl Japan in Shinjuku, each dedicated to one or more\n\t\t\tspecific genres. Part 2 is the one for most of us to want to visit. On\n\t\t\tarrival, what was being played but Rotten Soul. I looked through the\n\t\t\tstore's intersting indie and alt selections, finding and buying a promo\n\t\t\tBeck CD that seemed interesting. After purchasing it I asked, in\n\t\t\tEnglish, as best I could to the helpful and non-English speaking staff\n\t\t\tif I could buy a ticket for the Sunday show. What appeared to be a\n\t\t\tticket was put on the counter in front of me, at which point I tried in\n\t\t\tvain to purchase it, but my offer of Yen was somehow not accepted. I\n\t\t\ttried to explain again I wanted to buy the ticket. My attempt at\n\t\t\texplanation yielded only an offer of a second ticket which I declined.\n\t\t\tSo, feeling like I had stolen a concert ticket, I slowly backed out the\n\t\t\tdoor.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI wasn't completely sure that I had indeed received a free ticket until\n\t\t\tI got into the show, gratis (except for a mandatory 500 Yen drink\n\t\t\tpurchase).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter a bit of rest, I met up with David and his friend Ivor (sp?) (a\n\t\t\tburgeoning fan) near the train station and we made our way to the venue,\n\t\t\tarriving around 6:30. The crowd proceeded to be about 80661f what it'd\n\t\t\tbeen on Saturday night; a good turnout for a Sunday JBC show in Japan,\n\t\t\twe felt. I understand from Pat that a great deal of the crowd had been\n\t\t\tthere the previous evening as well.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSunday, Pat did not come out before the show began, but he did show and\n\t\t\tcheer on Max and Owen during the opening set. I still do not recall\n\t\t\tseeing Steve right at that time, but I may not have been looking around\n\t\t\ttoo much. Again, I attached myself to Ann and Linda, did I mention they\n\t\t\tare both delightful people? They took my obsessive JBC-ishness in\n\t\t\tstride, or at least faked it well. I did have a chance to talk with\n\t\t\tSteve a little later in the evening, and of course he was just as\n\t\t\tpleasant and approachable as the Britishers.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax played a few different tunes than on Saturday night, and was equally\n\t\t\tas well received as before. Sound was once again great, I think. The\n\t\t\tcrowd seemed a bit more animated Sunday, or maybe that was because\n\t\t\tSaturday's Canadian contingent was not there to provide the contrast. In\n\t\t\tany event, again, a good time was had by all.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDD's set seemed similar to that of the previous evening. Perhaps they\n\t\t\twere a little more at ease compared to Saturday. Anyway, they all seemed\n\t\t\tto be enjoying themselves and the somewhat more responsive crowd.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe JBC's set was a bit different than Saturday's; I believe they did\n\t\t\tnot play \"She's a Yo Yo\" on Saturday night. Also, Pat came out solo for\n\t\t\tthe first encore and played an old song about cats which I hadn't heard\n\t\t\tbefore. Very enjoyable of course. They seemed to have played a bit\n\t\t\tlonger on Sunday, and afterward we stuck around during which time\n\t\t\tvarious autographs were dispensed. Briefly we retired to the bar\n\t\t\topposite the stage side of the Loft, and despite Owen's efforts to bid\n\t\t\tme a good evening I tagged along for a pleasant and low-key dinner\n\t\t\tattended by both bands, some people from the label, and Ann and Linda.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt was all great fun, I can't say when I 've spent a more enjoyable two\n\t\t\tconsecutive evenings.

The\n\t\t\t\t drive was long, but we reached N&uuml;remberg in about 6 hours or\n\t\t\t\t so. The initial plan was to go straight on to Munich, but Pat's\n\t\t\t\t judgment at N&uuml;remberg  (pun intended) was to stay the night and\n\t\t\t\t pick up the additional two hours or so the next day.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hotel we stayed at was French, and had all of the modern\n\t\t\t\t conveniences of a plastic room with a mattress on the floor.\n\t\t\t\t Indeed, we got onto the elevator, which promptly trapped us until\n\t\t\t\t Owen smartly came to look for us. Good thing, too...for we know\n\t\t\t\t what happens when you leave a Fish too long in an elevator (don't\n\t\t\t\t we?)...Also, no phones in the room (hence, no internet connection,\n\t\t\t\t hence no report...QED)\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tI enjoyed a much needed shower and a good night's sleep, and\n\t\t\t\t in the morning, we had breakfast outside a small cafe. We again\n\t\t\t\t took to the autobahn, arriving in Munich mid-afternoon.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter setting up, the band did a rehearsal (since they hadn't\n\t\t\t\t had one...even prior to the Hamburg gig) and really tightened\n\t\t\t\t up. By soundcheck they were in the groove, and well looking forward\n\t\t\t\t to the show.\n\t\t\t   <p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe club owner prepared dinner for all, after which I went for\n\t\t\t\t a stroll. Former JBC alum Peter 'No Show' Crouch turned up, to\n\t\t\t\t everyone's delight. I ran merchandise before and after the show,\n\t\t\t\t and once again got to be 'JBC answer man', a job I am uniquely\n\t\t\t\t suited for. Pat decided that I was in charge of 'Public relations',\n\t\t\t\t and was pleased with the number of CDs that sold...so I am earning\n\t\t\t\t my keep.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe show itself was great: a nice club, a good audience, and\n\t\t\t\t the band was keen to play. Crouchy even got up (after a chant\n\t\t\t\t of 'Crou-chy, Crou-chy') and played on 'Zombie Love'. Three or\n\t\t\t\t four of the people that I sold CDs to hadn't heard of the band\n\t\t\t\t before, so that itself speaks to the performance.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tTonight we are all flopping in one big room over the club...\n\t\t\t\t Beds strewn about the floor, slumber party style. In the morning,\n\t\t\t\t the band plans to go to the pub to watch more football. (The\n\t\t\t\t good thing about not being into sports is, you get to sleep in.)\n\t\t\t\t Then we make our way back to Nuremburg for the show there. No\n\t\t\t\t cheap French hotel tomorrow though, an old friend of Owen's will\n\t\t\t\t be putting us up.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tSo to bed, to dream of windmills off the autobahn and breakfast\n\t\t\t\t strudel.

I sang Owen the ComedySportz\n\t\t\t\t birthday song, which he enjoyed (I guess if you've never heard\n\t\t\t\t it before, it's still funny). We watched football (Italy vs.\n\t\t\t\t South Korea) which was (apparently) the most exciting game of\n\t\t\t\t the cup thus far (overtime, with Korea pulling it out with a\n\t\t\t\t beautiful header in the final minutes).

We informed him\n\t\t\t\t that everyone was drinking, and therefore, no one had hands free\n\t\t\t\t to clap. Armed with this information (not to mention Pat finding\n\t\t\t\t some kind of undisclosed inspiration in-between sets), the band\n\t\t\t\t launched into the second half in high gear, filling the square\n\t\t\t\t with the 'ROCK show'...a far cry from the more pop-flavored garden\n\t\t\t\t show of two nights before. Beers were being dropped in favor\n\t\t\t\t of clapping and cheering. This was the sound of the band having\n\t\t\t\t fun, and Pat in particular going positively MENTAL. Needless\n\t\t\t\t to say, the band went after the post-show festivities with a\n\t\t\t\t similar fervor to that of the show itself.

From the release of the band’s first album Bath of Bacon on Glass Records in 1983 up to their crowd-funded and self-released most recent album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers from 2012 (reissued by Fire Records in 2016), frontman Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher himself) has led various incarnations of the group through a consistent (if somewhat sporadic in recent times) catalog of music to rival that any band out there. But much of the band’s music has been out of print for years, the victim of labels going out of business or being bought up, and of general bad luck. Fire Records has undertaken a project to right these wrongs, releasing a series of box sets collecting the band’s work. The first of these, The Wasted Years, came out last fall and collects the band’s four Glass Records-era albums. The second, The Violent Years, came out on Friday and collects the band’s first four albums (out of six total) for Creation Records. In honor of these releases, the current line-up held a performance last week at the storied 100 Club in the heart of London.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWhat might have been somewhat surprising, for a show meant to celebrate the reissue of such a storied back catalog, was how much of the night (a full half of the set) concentrated on the latest album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers. After an introductory variant on the “Jazz Butcher Theme” from In Bath of Bacon, Fish and his band went directly to four songs from that record, “Animals,” “Tombé dans les pommes,” the title track, and “Black Raoul.” The record appeared two more times later in the set, with “Shakey” and “Solar Core.” Possibly an indication that Fish is more interested in the present than in dwelling too much in the past, but the songs are still very much classic Jazz Butcher material. Certainly no one in the audience seemed to mind.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tBut Fish and his current band (which has not yet appeared on any recordings) did make several nods back to the “classic” Butcher, with “Living In a Village” from 1988’s Fishcotheque, “Mr. Odd” from 1990’s Cult of the Basement, and “Shirley Maclaine” from 1991’s Condition Blue representing The Violent Years set, and “Party Time” from In Bath of Bacon. The arrangements of the songs were updated to fit with the latest line-up (particularly the impressive trumpet and flugelhorn playing of Simon Taylor, which added a unique tone to the music) but were still instantly recognizable.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe biggest surprise of the night for many was the inclusion of a new song, “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar.” The band has been performing the track the track for a couple of years now, but it has yet to appear in recorded form. “You can’t buy this one anywhere. I guess that means it’s time for a new album,” teased Fish, to a roar of approval from the audience. Hopefully with the renewed interest that the box sets are generating, it won’t be too long until that becomes a reality.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe band closed out the evening with an encore of “Southern Mark Smith” from 1984’s A scandal in Bohemia. The enthusiasm of the audience even seemed to take Fish and the band by surprise, so they added one more song that wasn’t on the setlist, a cover of The Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner” (which the Jazz Butcher released as a single in 1984). “That’s all the songs we know!” Fish said, promising that the band would be back soon. True to his word, another set at the 100 Club, opening for The Bevis Frond, has already been announced for the end of May.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tSinger-songwriter Tim Keegan opened the show, performing songs from his most recent album The Long Game, self-released in 2015. A long-time cohort of performers including Robyn Hitchcock and The Blue Aeroplanes, Keegan had made a mark in the early-to-mid 2000s with his band Departure Lounge, but disappeared from the scene for several years. He says that he’s ready to stage a return, with a “proper” release of The Long Game followed by new material coming soon.\n\t\t</p>"},{"gigtext_id":200,"datetime":"1993-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":201,"datetime":"1993-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":202,"datetime":"1993-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":203,"datetime":"1993-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":204,"datetime":"1993-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":205,"datetime":"1993-02-21T20:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":206,"datetime":"1993-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"},{"gigtext_id":207,"datetime":"1993-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":"soundman","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=performer&q=Joe+Foster\">Joe Foster</a>"}]}
