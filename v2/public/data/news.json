			It's not often that an artist gets to do a Bowie by consciously carving their personal epitaph into the grooves of their final LP. The Highest in the Land is that rarity of an album, and it could not have been made by a more brilliantly poetic and fearlessly sarcastic writer than Pat Fish, also known as The Jazz Butcher.

		Dear Pat:<br/>
<br/>
I do a radio show for low power/internet station in Los Angeles: KHUG.rocks. I love your work. My show is a pre-recorded hour. I can send you a sample show if you wish. Sometimes I focus on one artist (JJ Cale, The Tubes, The Alice Cooper Groupâ€”week after played Caroline Wheelerâ€™s Birthday PresentðŸ˜‰&#41; and I am going to soon do an hour on TJB. If any chance I could email you some questions would love to then read your answers on air. Have also done rock journalism off and on since I was 15 fyi.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway longshot but never hurts to ask. Really love your work and have turned many fellow Angelenos and friends onto it. Have played on air Shakey, Devil, Jungle, YoYo, CWBP and Roadrunner.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are healthy after health scare in recent years. You do great stuff.<br/>

		Olof Palme was a great man and the Jazz Butcher&#39;s song about him was a great song. WT holy living F is going on with that song? You can find lyrics online, but absolutely no links to recordings, performances, videos, nothing. Is there something going on with the rights? A legal fight? Or is socialism still such a nasty word in the US that it&#39;s been culturally erased? I have the lyrics and I play it busking. I think it&#39;s such a culturally important song, it needs to be household familiar and played far and wide. I&#39;m gonna keep playing it. I&#39;m so poor I&#39;m judgement proof, so sue me. Be my guest. It needs to be heard.

the years! Grew up in Winnipeg, introduced to the JBC by <br/>
Brave New Waves, on the CBC radio. Saw you in concert in <br/>
88 or 89 when you came through on tour. Constantly <br/>
somewhere on my playlists. My kids sing along to the songs <br/>
as well! Thanks for being a meaningful part of my musical life!

		Just cranked, very loudly, the Glass/Cartel vinyl 45 of Groovin in the bus lane and Hard on my insane audiophile system here in Brentwood (Los Angeles&#41;CA. I was strutting around my house like a rooster in heat.<br/>
 I have been listening to the Butcher since about &#39;83. Saw them Many times on any tour that came within 1000 miles of me. Last show was Mercury Lounge NYC I think in early 2000s. Met Pat on several occasions. An honor. <br/>
It&#39;s hard to overstate the joy that your (and Max&#39;s&#41; music has brought, and still brings to me over almost 40 years later. I have almost all of the original vinyl. I won&#39;t listen on CD. Just isn&#39;t the same. <br/>
Your songwriting craft and wit put you among the best in the rock and roll tradition. IMHO. <br/>
Thanks Pat. For the gift of your genius.

By the way, I&#39;m still holding you to that promise of a set of those rare tunes that I need in cd quality.

I wrote some of them, so I should know... BTW, love most of your stuff I&#39;ve encountered (though have only heard through &#34;Cult of the Basement&#34;&#41;, with &#34;Scandal in Bohemia&#34; being my favorite -- truly fine stuff.

		I am curious if the Wasted years re-issue have been remastered/remixed or whatever.  I already own all these discs, though my copy of Big Planet/Scarey Planet has a very annoying skip during one of the songs.  I also thought the vocal tracks on that album were a little muddy or surpressed.<br/>

		You may well long have known this - if so sorry for repetition and for â€˜re-bringingâ€™ old bad news â€“ but I only just learned that KB Mensah died on NY Eve in Ghana. I see he&#39;s mentioned somewhere on this site, as an old school/college friend of several JB-linked musicians.<br/>
<br/>
He and I had remained good friends, though latterly only getting together occasionally, when we were both in London (heâ€™d been living back in Ghana for some years&#41; â€“ he always made a real effort to stay in touch.<br/>
<br/>
So many good (albeit, from the earliest days, often stoned&#41; memories of him, so often revolving also around music, from listening to reggae and jazz in his Oxford rooms to going together, later, in London to hear everything from Louis Moholo and other visiting Africans to various latterday manifestations of the Institution/Random Hold/Jazz Butcher â€˜familyâ€™â€¦ I wish the attached could show, and let me hear again, his laugh.<br/>

I confess, I had no small amount of trepidation approaching the new record.  Indeed, I&#39;ve had it in my possession for a year and I just completed the third listening.  <br/>
<br/>
Since the JBC hits me on a basic emotional level (even the funny stuff, always has done&#41;, I worry about the releases from my favorite artists as I age exponentially.  It&#39;s not doubt, it&#39;s just wondering where this communique will fit in the cupboard of things near and dear to me.  Either there&#39;s less space in there, or there are more items in store than I&#39;d care to admit.  <br/>

		My children are 8 and 10, girl and boy respectively.  My wife sings with a chorus on Monday nights, so I&#39;m with them exclusively those evenings.  This past Monday I told them if they brushed their teeth and got ready for bed extra quickly, I&#39;d play them a special song.  They raced through their evening ritual and came down to the living room, whereupon I played &#34;Love Kittens&#34; at a substantial volume.  (This song drives their mother up the wall, you understand, so I can only play it on Mondays when she&#39;s gone.&#41;  They laughed out loud, danced around the room, and mimed the saxophone solo.  Then they asked me to play it again and again, trying to keep up with the introductory &#34;meows&#34; and pantomiming &#34;only six inches tall...&#34;  A great time was had by three.  Thought you&#39;d like to know you brought quite a lot of joy to two little kids.  <br/>

Wanted to a&#41; thank you again for pulling together an amazing night tonight. Liams beautiful, breathy melodies were a revelation, and I will be looking him up when I can. And David J has no doubt been on and off the majority of tonight&#39;s attendees record players/ tape decks/ cd players/ mp3 thingies for the past 30 years. When you think you know what to expect from someone you have grown up with, you get hit with an extraordinary show, such as was put on tonight, marvellously accompanied by Michael Berg. and b&#41; I wanted to apologise for nicking off after you kindly went to find me a cd! I did lurk about for a while, until the call of nature took over both of us. Feel bad now for incurring you unneccesary postage costs! If you are ever passing, do pop it through the letter box, or better still..... pop in for a brew.<br/>
THANKS again for organising tonight. A very special night for everyone in attendance!!!

		The &#34;Jazz Butchers&#34; appear to be a young, serious jazz band from the Los Angeles area. I believe that they have one album out at the moment. I also believe that the first of &#34;our&#34; Jazz Butcher records was almost certainly released before any of the members of this jazz band were actually born. So I&#39;m rather looking forward to an irate letter from their management, asking us to change our band name.<br/>

 Best of luck with the new release, I looked for it on Amazon today, hoping maybe the CD&#39;S were hitting the rack.<br/>
  While there I found something by a group called &#34; The Jazz Butchers&#34;, I clicked on the 1st MP3 sample, it&#39;s some jazz-rock fission thing. <br/>
Are you aware of this group? Are they compensating you for the use of the name? What gives?

I&#39;ve been in contact with all the usual JBC fan conspirators and I know they&#39;ll agree...do yourselves a tremendous favor and pick yourselves up a copy or 3!! Pat & Max are already gearing up for a few gigs in Japan in early Dec.!! Let&#39;s see what we can do about bringing them west across the pond for a little North American action!!!

Just ordered and received (took me few decades to catch up sorry&#41; Condition Blue, Glorioius and more.  Put CB on and heard Shes a YoYo for first time.  WOW.  As exhilarating a pop song as i have ever heard up there with i Got A Line on you by SPirit.  Played it 15 times today.  No kidding.  Somehow missed tours.  53 year old Hollywood exec in LA.  You should be opening for Stranglers (Giants in more ways than one&#41; next tour.  <br/>

		Howdy Folks!<br/>
I am a longtime JBC fan.  I had the great pleasure of seeing Pat and friends several times here in Canada.  Good times.  I am also a big music collector and though I spend a great deal of time snooping the corners of the internet and cd shops all over the world I am still without a CD of In Bath Of Bacon, Big Questions Gift of Music vol 2 and the live Hamburg glass era cds.  I NEED them in my collection on cd.  I have them on vinyl and have ripped them to cd but it just ain&#39;t the same.  I have plenty of extra rare JBC to trade ( an extra Scandal In Bohemia / Sex and Travel glass era CD in mint&#41; plus a ton of extra rare jbc vinyl.  It is criminal that this wonderful music is largely out of print.  Anyone want to trade or sell me the goodies I need.  Mr. Fish, is there no chance of future re-issues?  Also while I am voicing my sob stories, why has Grooving In The Bus Lane (Bloody Nonsense version&#41; been released on cd?  Anywho, I just thought I would express my love for all eras of Jazz Butcher material and throw in a rude complaint or two.  Can&#39;t wait to hear more new stuff.  I have Max&#39;s recent cds as well as the new Pat tracks on the Northhampton cd, but do sign me up for more new cds and I would like to second someone else&#39;s suggestion of a fan funded project.  That might be the way to get reissues off the ground too.  Don&#39;t ask mw what I paid for some of my glass era cds on ebay.  Yikes!!!!<br/>

		I know that Pat is more than capable of composing his own defence, but I am pleased to see that the passage of &#39;a few years&#39; and the discovery that his critic was responsible for a &#39;load of boring old dad rock&#39; has helped the author of the Last Post to get over said criticism (if saying &#39;good luck with that lads&#39; can be called criticism...&#41; and move on with his life. Seems to slightly miss the point too that without Pat, who knows whether his (and probably most of ours too&#41; beloved Spacemen 3 would ever have made it out of Rugby.<br/>

Anyway, pleased to see that he was at least brave enough to name his band too, so we could check them out...err no he didn&#39;t.<br/>

Years later I&#39;m reading a Spacemen 3 book and I finally find out who you are so I come to your website to listen to your music and I have to say what a bunch of boring old dad rock.

Thanks for the tunes, Pat. I hope that doesn&#39;t sound flip. I was telling a friend a few months ago that I could (and will&#41; happily listen to your music, desert island or not, for the rest of my life. It makes me feel: good, thoughtful, angry, connected,...  and who doesn&#39;t need that? To that end, if funding for a new album is still pending/wanting;trying, please keep advised. Perhaps global fan funding is possible. Could you, or possibly fans, create a sort of co-op, without too much red tape?<br/>

		Still not sure. I recently imagined that I hooked up with a former co-worker at a record store, and remembered a bit of music from that time. Yours was at the forefront, for what that&#39;s worth. <br/>
Now I&#39;m most assuredly not sure, but I am &#39;happy&#39; I guess, that the man whose tunes I continue to dial up(not Itune-wise,etc.-I still use a walkman!&#41;has a forum. Thanks for maintaining the idea that kick-ass rock can sulk, and rage, and kick ass, and love, and regret, and pilfer one&#39;s own soul for a time, all the while kicking ass for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if the I-tune thing would be the better way for yourself financially. You need to thrive more.<br/>
<br/>
I typed the red word into the box, but I&#39;d still like the hose again. Rock n&#39; Roll, I guess!

		Hey Pat ... <br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Canada. Been a while - was a big fan back in the day, and we even opened for the JB at a hall in the middle of a park in Kitchener, Ontario, circa 1986 or 87. ANYWAY ... am coming to London for a bit in very early November. If you&#39;re playing it would be a blast to catch it. <br/>
<br/>
Best, <br/>

		Pat Pat Pat, you simply have to get this new albums worth of material out to us punks. It&#39;s a necessity. Even if it has to be via the evils of itunes or a simple subscription CD or vinyl deal. That would really make a haddock smile. Look forward to the Wilson DVD as well. Love and fishes Marko x

		Hey Pat!<br/>
44 days and 27 minutes after the last bloke...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m living in old Europe these days--in Dortmund,  the <br/>
Pittsburgh of Germany. Took a job causing a ruckus at the local <br/>
Stadt Theater. Woyzeck, Threepenny Opera and other teutonic <br/>
classics. <br/>
Anyway--I&#39;ve imported my music salon, Small Beast. We also do <br/>
Hamburg and Berlin.  I think Thomas T. might have mentioned to <br/>
you my cockamany idea for conjuring up the non-existent <br/>
supergroup reunion of Marcus Maria Jansen, Thomas, you and <br/>
me for a few shows. Now might be that moment. Or Spring <br/>
2012, anyway--if we can all plan that far ahead. It&#39;d be perfect <br/>
for my beastliness. <br/>
Get in touch Butcher! Tell me what ya think. <br/>
Be well!<br/>

		..as I am just sitting here listening to the aforementioned Mr Langley&#39;s new offering (and very fine it is too&#41; - although an accompanying download code would have been handy! Presumably you would need to know (on whatever format&#41; how many people were willing to buy (or indeed pre-pay&#41;, to help fund?<br/>

		Wild, really?  Is it all done-like?  Could it be put out on the interwebs?  Or is this a whole-single-unit-like and wouldn&#39;t like being split into pieces and downloaded?  Could you go the old way and press some rekkids like dear Mr. Langley has done with the new Aeros record?  What&#39;s the cost?  How much you want to make outta this deal?<br/>

		You should be fine turning up on the night, though the venue is small so don&#39;t leave it too late in the evening. Playing solo, as I shall be, I think there&#39;s a danger that Racheland might put everybody to sleep...
