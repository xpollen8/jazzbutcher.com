	<p>
	i talked recently with a friend who had been in contact with pat.<br>
	<br>
	for those of you wondering about the domestic release of _condition<br>
	blue_...  apparently the label will be restless (a division of mute,<br>
	i believe), and it sounds like they want the single to be<br>
	_shes a yo-yo_, if only for the incredibly stupid promotion<br>
	of passing out yo-yos to every college radio station in the country.<br>
	so..  from what i hear, this ablum in going to actually have some<br>
	promotion in the USofA.<br>
	<br>
	pat is in france this month recording with &quot;some group&quot;.<br>
	after that, we may see him &quot;march/april&quot;.  the line-up would<br>
	be the one they are using in their european tour:<br>
	two guitarists, bass, and a drum machine.<br>
	<br>
	wish i knew more.<br>

	&gt; She's a Yo-Yo??!!!!  That is probably the most feeble song on the record!<br>
	&gt; (Next to &quot;Honey&quot;).  I mean, if they wanted a tune that rocked, they could<br>
	&gt; have used Shirley!  But then again, I guess that all they are really<br>
	&gt; interested in is easy promotion ideas.  But if they want those, they should<br>
	&gt; have used Racheland, and passed out razor blades.<br>

	<p>
	Well, I spoke to Pat this morning.  I wanted to find out if the rumors<br>
	about an upcoming tour are based in reality.  It turns out that there will<br>
	be a JBC spring tour.  He has been using a drum machine on all of the<br>
	European dates, but he thinks that he will be brining over a real live<br>
	drummer this time around.  He says that he hopes that a drummer won't<br>
	make the tour too &quot;rock and roll&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	The tour should be starting up mid-April, and the first show will be in<br>
	Georgia(?)!  I guess that the new album is being distributed in the<br>
	US by a company based in Athens GA, so that is where they will be starting<br>
	the tour.  He is not sure of all he details yet though.  He said to try<br>
	calling him this time next month, and that he should have all of the details<br>
	by then.  He just got back from France, where he was recording a record for<br>
	a band called Chelsea (not THAT Chelsea!).  <br>
	<br>
	&gt;From what he was saying, it sounds like he has been very busy recording other<br>
	peoples records for them.<br>
	<br>
	Here is an entertaining tidbit:  Shirley MacLaine's manager called up Pat's<br>
	manager and requested that he send her a lyric sheet for the song Shirely<br>
	MacLaine!  I wonder if she is a fan or just condsidering sueing him.<br>
	<br>
	More later...<br>

	<p>
	I would appreciate it if anyone who knows where and when an upcoming<br>
	My Bloody Valentine show is going to be.  A friend wants to do a road<br>
	trip this weekend or next, and if it is withing a days drive, I might want<br>
	to go and see them again.  So if you get a chance, please consult your<br>
	local trendy newspaper and let me know.  Many thanks!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Also, I took a look at the domestic release of Condition Blue, and the<br>
	track order is totally different.  Racheland moved up 5 notches from 9<br>
	to 4, Monkeyface dropped all the way down to 9, and She's a YoYo jumped<br>
	all the way from 7 to 1.  It looks like they are trying to showcase that<br>
	one, since it is the single.  I feel like Casey Kasem!<br>

	&gt; i'm so far really impressed by it, maybe as good as fishcotheque,<br>
	&gt;if not then   definitely a step in the right direction.  <br>
	<br>
	I  don't think that I<br>
	skip over any songs on fishcotheque.  I skip over about half of the songs on<br>
	this one.  The songs on fishcotheque have this nice sublety about them, while<br>
	this one is about as subtle as (insert your own metaphor (or is it a simile?)<br>
	here)_____________.  I think that is what hurts it the most.<br>
	<br>
	When I spoke with Pat a few weeks ago, he said that this record was recorded<br>
	for only one person (his ex?) and if anyone else wanted to listen in, that was<br>
	fine, but it wasn't recorded as a spectator sport.  And if you are trying to<br>
	I get a point across to someone, sublety isn't always the best way to do it.<br>
	In that context, the lack of sublety is much more forgivable.  But that still<br>
	doesn't make it a great album.  I think that I am sounding over critical<br>
	again.  I mean, I do still play the album once in awhile, and I don't intend<br>
	to trade it in for a Grateful Dead cd, but I refuse to abandon the expectations<br>
	I have for a jbc record.  This one has some great songs, but by no stretch of<br>
	the imagination is it a great album.  I am still caught up in the production<br>
	thing.                                                                           <br>
	&gt;&gt; no cheap studio noise of Cult, either.<br>
	&gt;&gt;(Cult is impossible to get clean samples from :-)<br>
	<br>
	Yeah, but what would you rather have, Devoid, &quot;cheap studio noise&quot; or<br>
	over-done background vocals.  I would prefer the sounds of a rabid gorilla<br>
	killing people with a chainsaw in the room next door than the background vocals.<br>
	<br>
	By the way, does anyone have the &quot;New Invention&quot; 12&quot; single?  I really like<br>
	the b-side song called &quot;almost brooklyn&quot;, and I was wondering what everyone<br>
	else thought about it.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; _our friends the filth_ seems to me to be a (finally) tolerable rendition<br>
	&gt; of a type of song that is on every album... the annoying parody/exercise in<br>
	&gt; repetition and sampling...   not bad, this time.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Every album&quot;?  What is the comparable song on Basement?<br>
	As Devoid points out &quot;bubonic plague&quot; is the one on BigScarey.  But the<br>
	chicken rap from fishcotheque doesn't fit into the same category.  And<br>
	that one has become an excellent live staple.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&gt;&gt;for fish-sampling-gone-overboard-into-brilliance,<br>

	<p>
	of course, it is my personal opinion, but...<br>
	Fish-  Best Way<br>
	BPSP-  Bubonic plague<br>
	Cult-  turtle bait<br>
	Blue-  our friends the filth<br>
	<br>
	those are the ones i get most annoyed with when i listen to these albums<br>
	granted, turtle bait doesn't have any sampling, but it is certainly annoying.<br>
	Best Way is good, in small doses.<br>
	<br>
	When i was talking about the annoying songs that i sort of group together, i <br>
	just meant the ones that i usually (or sometimes) skip when listening.<br>
	Our friends the filth seems like a keeper.<br>
	<br>
	Re: what someone said about not skipping any on fishcotheque:<br>
	I agree, i can see that i will be skipping some of these new songs eventually, <br>
	when i know them a little better, but the ones i like are reminiscient of Fish.<br>
	The whole fishcotheque album gets bland faster than the previous ones, though.<br>
	<br>
	of course, my personal fave is Distressed Gentlefolk, even though Scandal in B.<br>
	had the best cover.<br>

	Well, it's finally out domestically.  I purchased a copy last weekend up<br>
	in Berkeley.  I think it's a good record.  When I first heard it a few<br>
	months ago, I really didn't like it.  But now it seems to have grown on<br>
	me.  BTW, I think I'm the only person here who still buys LP's because<br>
	no one has commented on the fact that &quot;Monkeyface&quot; is only on the CD.  I<br>
	think the muddy production is only slightly improved on the CD.<br>
	<br>
	I have to disagree with Arik about comparing &quot;Turtle Bait&quot; with &quot;Best Way&quot;.<br>
	The latter, I think, is a great song, and as has been pointed, is really<br>
	excellent(!) live.  &quot;Bait&quot; on the other hand doesn't really have much<br>
	going for it, is universally disliked and, as far as I know, is never<br>
	played in concert.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Pat's Pet Projects
	<p>
	I spoke with The Man this weekend, and he mentioned some of the stuff<br>
	he is currently working on.<br>
	<br>
	1)  A Brian Eno cover for a Eno cover compilation.  When I called, he was<br>
	experimenting with &quot;The True Wheel&quot;, an excellent pop song.<br>
	<br>
	2)  Producing a French band called &quot;Chelsea&quot;  (not THE Chelsea).<br>
	<br>
	3)  Producing a band called The Love Kittens, who cover &quot;Angels&quot;.  On the day<br>
	they were recording Angels, the singer was out sick, so Pat did the vocals.<br>
	<br>
	4)  Already in the can is something by Pat and Richard and &quot;a girl singer&quot;,<br>
	called &quot;The Vaguely Familiar&quot;.  Pat says that Sky records is &quot;eyeing&quot; it.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, none of the above is currently available.<br>
	<br>
	I am psyched for this tour.  JBC and chemical abuse.  Ask for it by name.<br>

	Does anybody happen to know when and where (and if) the Jazz Butcher will<br>
	be playing in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area?<br>
	<br>
	Also, a local record store has this CD single titled &quot;We Love You&quot; and<br>
	contains three mixes of that song, apparently a Stones cover or so the<br>
	writing credit leads me to believe.  The artist is simply listed as J.B.C.<br>
	Since it's out on Creation records it seems possible that this is the JBC<br>
	that we all know and love.  But I have my doubts.  The song isn't from<br>
	any albums I have and I'm 80% sure I've got them all.  This in itself<br>
	doesn't mean anything but it just seems so atypical of Pat to not include<br>
	any bonus tracks other than remixes of the title song.  Is this just a<br>
	case of a record store's misfiling or is this really an official Jazz<br>
	Butcher product?<br>

	<br>
	the tour:<br>
	pat is unsure how the audiences will respond to the anticipated &quot;downer&quot; set.<br>
	_susie_, _angels_, etc.  there will be no elephants or drinking songs and<br>
	not as many older songs as in the past.<br>
	the second geetarist will be the guy who played the solo on _girls say yes_.<br>
	neither paul or alex green will be along this time.<br>
	the last show they do before the north american tour will be one in london<br>
	around easter.<br>
	<br>
	pat has produced a french band named chelsea and he played saxophone<br>
	on 3 tracks of the new spectrum (sonic boom) album entitled _soul kiss_.<br>
	<br>
	one to add to the discography:<br>
	a magazine from 1984 called: what a nice way to turn 17<br>
	included a 4-song sampler with the jazz butcher song _chinese envoy_.<br>
	david j also contributed an article on john cale to this issue.<br>

	<p>
	I, for one, am actually looking forward to the downer set.  Most of my<br>
	favorite JB songs are the &quot;downers&quot; - Angels, Sister Death, Suzie,<br>
	Racheland, The Good Ones, etc.  I wouldn't object to hearing Southern Mark<br>
	Smith or Big Saturday or Girlfriend on this tour either, (but wait!  I seem<br>
	to remeber Big Saturday and Girlfriend being on the Vienna tape from last<br>
	December), but I think that if Pat is really into the set that he is doing,<br>
	then maybe the show will be a bit more intense.  I mean, he might be getting<br>
	bored with doing Caroline Wheeler and Partytime at every single show.  It would<br>
	be kind of depressing if the JBC turned into a wandering nostaligia act, wouldnt<br>
	it?<br>

	didn't see our beloved listowner at the hoboken show, but i can agree with <br>
	this description wholeheartedly. pat was *really* subdued and downright melan-<br>
	choly. even when he made light of things, he was fatalistic in his delivery.<br>
	<br>
	despite all that, the show was still fairly good. but i hope that pat cheers<br>
	up sometime soon anyways...<br>

	<p>
	Hi everyone.  I just got back from NYC, where I saw the JBC play two<br>
	sets at a club called Tramps.  I was able to catch 7 dates before I<br>
	had to return to work.  The JBC are really getting their act together,<br>
	and are starting to really rock.  They have added several songs to the<br>
	set list since the first show, and you should really catch them if you<br>
	can.  David is taping most of the shows for a possible live album, and<br>
	some of the tapes are just amazing.<br>

	<p>
	I saw this in someone's .sig on the 4AD list:<br>
	<br>
	from jeff wright's .sig:<br>
	&gt; &quot;We kept getting pushed further back in the file cabinet, towards<br>
	&gt; the Jazz Butcher and the Jasmine Minks.  When we got to the <br>
	&gt; Revolving Paint Dream, we figured it was time to leave.&quot; <br>
	&gt; -- Moonshake on leaving Creation<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, the two shows I went to were really great, with Cambridge being<br>
	better than Hoboken.  The band was tighter, more energetic, and seemed<br>
	to be having more fun.  I like &quot;Condition Blue&quot; a lot better now, after<br>
	hearing the songs live, though I'm not sure why really.<br>
	<br>
	The highlight, for me anyway, was &quot;Betty Page&quot; during the first encore<br>
	in Cambridge.  It was just Pat and Pete, and Pete did a great job with<br>
	the &quot;max-eiderisms&quot;, though he did seem a bit nervous about playing it.  <br>
	<br>
	(abrupt change of the subject to a thread going on in a completely<br>
	different mailing list)<br>
	woj, I have to disagree with you about Bloom.  I thought they would<br>
	have been ok if their singer wasn't such a posuer.  I mean, he didn't<br>
	really have to wrap himself around the mike stand, or make grotesque<br>
	movements a la Peter Murphy.  (One man's emotionalism and sensitivity<br>
	is another man's silliness?)  And I didn't like his voice either.<br>
	So were you the guy leaning up against the stage-left wall while Bloom<br>
	played?<br>
	<br>
	(back to the Butcher)<br>
	The Cambridge show was disappointing in that there were so few people<br>
	there.  I'm not good at estimating crowd size, but I'd say it was between<br>
	100 and 150.  (Hey Mitch, do you have a better estimate?)<br>
	<br>
	The band just keeps getting better.  Go to the shows in your area, and<br>
	bring all your friends!  Show Pat that we love him, and care about his<br>
	music a great deal!  And don't request &quot;Who Loves You Now?&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	If you get a chance to talk to Pat, be sure to mention you're part of<br>
	David's network.  I think he's amused by our very existence.<br>

	remember when i told you i got condition blue<br>

	who proceeded to sell it as a used tape.<br>

	i found this out when pete was in my<br>

	why does it say SKY records on it so big like this.  it seems<br>
	like some sort of bootleg or something.&quot;<br>

	i was too silly to realize that it s not the <br>
	official release, and soon read the cardboard<br>

	I'm the Butcher fiend who emailed you a couple of months ago.<br>

	My friend and I talked to him for about fifteen minutes before the concert.<br>
	I'm kicking myself for not going to Music Millenium because he played for<br>
	about an hour-stuff like Love Kittens and other old stuff.<br>
	I rate this conert much better than the previous tour (Cult of the Basement),<br>
	even though he played a lot of songs from CotB.  Speaking of last years tour,<br>
	the Butcher only netted about 300 bucks for the five week tour.<br>

	i agree entirely - pat (musically) has his shit<br>
	together, i think, and it shows.  fuckinggreat set selection.<br>
	<br>
	the in-stores are usually pretty fun, i have a couple recorded,<br>
	although the quality of those is iff-y.<br>
	<br>
	the *real* shows, though are the best live JBC recordings<br>
	i have ever heard :-)  honestly, most are very nice sounding<br>
	recordings.  what i did was took the stereo signal from the<br>
	soundboard and mixed signal from stereo microphones live to DAT.<br>
	right now i have about 20 shows taped from this tour, and i have<br>
	another 10 days or so when they pass close enough for me to<br>
	follow again.<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> frendli@cats.UCSC.EDU
	<br><b>Subject:</b> saw the show in SF
	<p>
	and here's what i thought:<br>
	first, there were a bunch of really annoying guys in front of us who had<br>
	apparently made friends with the tour manager and talking about &quot;this is the<br>
	best connection we've ever had!&quot;  and I couldn't help but chuckle.  I'm glad<br>
	they were too into themselves to pay attention to me.  Anyway, later in the show<br>
	, when they were drunk, they kind of floated around near the front of the crowd,<br>
	where I was,<br>
	and they would kind of fall on you and lean in your face and when nudged out of<br>
	the way would take great offense.  Anyway, the t-shirts are cool... i don't know<br>
	how well i like having that big &quot;puss-filled heart&quot; in the middle.  But heck, i<br>
	bought two of 'em.  I also picked up the cd of spooky; they were peddlin' a few<br>
	wares along with the shirts.<br>
	<br>
	now, the important stuff.<br>
	I thought the set was really good, nice an mellow as promised.  I was very<br>
	pleased<br>
	when they played Girlfriend and FAlling In Love, and of course, Angels.  I was<br>
	disappointed with the club, Slim's, because i would have rather been able to sit<br>
	back and relax and enjoy the show than have to fight fucked up people with too<br>
	much energy for how mellow the show was  just to be able to see.<br>
	Butch was in fine form though.  eg:<br>
	&quot;Who's mooing at me?  Raise your hand if you're mooing at me.  (As he tunes his<br>
	Tele)  I've got a good idea.  Why don't you fuck off?&quot;  and similarly:<br>
	(I didn't catch what the person said, but he replied)  &quot;Does that mean fuck off<br>
	and go home?  Because you can, you know, it's a free country.&quot;<br>
	Pete was sweet on partytime.  I was sorta lookin' forward to some more of his<br>
	own solo's... but i never mind hearing max's.  The banter was really good with<br>
	the audience, I guess that's what i'm trying to say.<br>
	<br>
	The set was excellent.  A good mix of older and new songs, and interesting e...<br>
	encore covers:  Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Take the skinheads bowling.<br>
	not to mention the treat:  &quot;Thing&quot;  per request of one of those people in the<br>
	front.  &quot;You want me to play Thing in front of people,&quot; Pat asked in disbelief.  <br>
	But then he did.<br>
	I was really hoping to hear Betty Paige.  Maybe I'll make it to the Los Osos<br>
	show tonight.<br>
	<br>
	set list, in no particular order, to follow.  Cover your eyes now if you want <br>
	be surprised at the show, if you haven't seen it yet.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Partytime/Southern Mark Smith (&quot;Light and Space&quot; version)/Girlfriend/Thing/<br>
	Falling in Love/Angels/Susie/She's On Drugs/Pineapple Tuesday/Mr. Odd/Girl Go/<br>
	Sister Death/girls say yes/she's a yo-yo/honey/shirley maclaine/racheland/<br>
	and the aforementioned covers.  Angels opened with the traditional<br>
	&quot;candy-colored clown&quot; bit... and during the break i caught  &quot;In heaven,<br>
	everything is fine&quot;<br>
	I wish they'd come through again.  A show in Santa Cruz would be especially<br>
	appreciated.  maybe never.  But hell, they're playing Los Osos for chrissake.<br>
	<br>
	anyway.  CATCH THE SHOW!  it's worth every $.  ( I think I spent $80 some after<br>
	all the T-shirts, cd, and tix for two friends)<br>
	<br>
	take care.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;If you want to see a comedy show, go see Nirvana.&quot;<br>

	whatever that means...  solo?  hmmmm.<br>
	<br>
	well.  i have been silent long enough, i suppose.  work does that to me.<br>
	being on the road for a few weeks with the jazz butcher was just what i<br>
	needed.  lots and lots of miles, time sitting around before the<br>
	shows, setting up, soundchecks, greasy french fries and beer.<br>
	<br>
	when the band connected with the audience (as i saw in baltimore, boston,<br>
	toronto, and chicago) the JBC were very good.  the off-nights (playing<br>
	in dives to 50 people, or having to deal with unprofessional club staff),<br>
	it was tense.<br>
	<br>
	it is obvious that pat and pete are the core of this incarnation of the JBC.<br>
	i am not certain how i feel about pete mimicing the eider style in _betty page_<br>
	and _partytime_, but he ripped through the newer material when needed.<br>
	_racheland_ always ended the normal set (as it does on _condition blue_ -<br>
	pat was furious that sky fucked up by switching the A&amp;B sides - _monkeyface_<br>
	is not supposed to end it all.  buy the creation release if you have the choice)<br>
	<br>
	the first day in canade, pats face blew up - an abscessed tooth made him truley<br>
	look like the elephant man.  how he continued for the 4 days until it was<br>
	finally pulled, i dont know.  chicago, i think, was the turning point.<br>
	before then, the band wasnt consistent - cock ups by the bass and drum player<br>
	were frequent.  with pats face back in order, and being back in a city he<br>
	liked, they shined for two shows.  the first one was the &quot;up&quot; set, the next<br>
	night was the &quot;down&quot; set.  they played during the 1st show a complete<br>
	improvisation piece entitled _beautiful snow white hair_, in tribute to<br>
	the fact that the soundman, iain ohiggins, had made the mistake of showing<br>
	them one of his baby pictures when he had snow white hair.  needless to say,<br>
	ohiggins nearly lost it when pat began babbling lyrics.  listening to the tape<br>
	later that night, pat was very pleased that they had pulled the improv off,<br>
	and felt that they were now ready for some serious playing.<br>
	look out california.<br>
	<br>
	through all the interviews, and hinted during stage chat, pat admits the<br>
	causes of his current state of mind.  i asked him &quot;what next?&quot; and he went<br>
	off, cursing the hipsters for embracing bands such as Carter the Unstoppable<br>
	Sex Machine, as they were once a group in pats shoes - aging, talented, but<br>
	not gaining the acceptance from serious work.  they sold out.  pat, detesting<br>
	that, probably will not.  he *is* serious about his work with the Black Eg,<br>
	and had brought rough mixes for new songs along.  i believe that the Black Eg<br>
	is not that far from the silly songs on _bath of bacon_, just that pat is<br>
	having to hide his involvement in it, so the Black Eg is as low-tech as possible<br>
	to throw people off.  &quot;maybe i will hang with the (von d&amp;auml;mmerung) brothers.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	he is not, though, the happy man he once was.  several blows to the emotional<br>
	chin have stunned him a bit, and he is coping as best he can: (of _condition<br>
	blue_): &quot;it is me screaming 'COME BACK' for 50 minutes.&quot;  the &quot;afghan vet at<br>
	a beach resort with a shotgun&quot; is the outwardly charasmatic mr fish, scarred<br>
	from life wanting to end it all, soon. it is a man who has been shielded<br>
	from normal life encounters finally on his own and not knowing how to cope,<br>
	except through a very public forum, which he has often apologised for.<br>
	<br>
	where will it lead?  i think that some solo touring would be less hectic<br>
	and expensive than a full blown tour.  he said that he hates the &quot;idea of<br>
	a drummer.  once a drum kit is on stage, the audience *expects* a rock and<br>
	roll show, which we arent, of course&quot;.  sky records had recommended a drummer<br>
	over a drum machine, even though the JBC had just finished a european tour<br>
	witth that line-up.  &quot;without a drummer, the stage is transformed - it can<br>
	become theatre.&quot;  a candleabra on the bass cabinet is a nod towards the theatre<br>
	experience.<br>

	<p>
	Hi.<br>
	<br>
	An abbreviated form of the JBC is supposed to be opening<br>
	for Downy Midlew on the west coast later in July.  It would just be<br>
	Pat and Pete doing the record store thing, I guess.  But Pat has been<br>
	talking about recording the new album in LA and Chicago, with Martin<br>
	doing half and Ian doing the other half.  They may end up spending<br>
	some time in Chicago between Athens and going back to LA.<br>
	<br>
	But it would be really nice to have Pat and Pete recording in Chicago.<br>
	<br>
	So what are the New Orleans through Athens dates?  I may just be able<br>
	to catch one more date on this tour if things work out the way I hope.<br>
	<br>
	If Pat and Pete are coming back to Chicago, you may want to give one<br>
	of them a ride back to the midwest if they need a ride.  I have no<br>
	idea what happens at the end of a tour, like if they have to hang out<br>
	in Atlanta for awhile or whatever.<br>

	Saw the JBC last night at Club Clearview in Dallas, which is a kind of<br>
	mini-Medusa's (for Chicago types) except with alcohol and no sailors.  This<br>
	means that the JBC's sound was fighting against the sound of the two adjacent<br>
	rooms (both playing disco).  Nonetheless, it was a good show.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        For trivia hounds, it may behoove one to know that Pat runs his<br>
	Telecaster through a Marshall Guv'nor pedal and a &quot;Stage Tuner&quot; pedal (I forget<br>
	who makes the tuner pedal...but it's the same company that put out a flanger<br>
	whose standard mode of operation was to invert the phase of the delayed signal,<br>
	making it weird among pedal flangers).  Dooj is the only one who uses a<br>
	wireless setup.  (Dooj is the bass player, if you didn't know.)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        The drum machine which was used by the Jazz Butcher when he went on<br>
	tour without a drummer was borrowed from Dooj.  Dunno what kind it is.  (No<br>
	drum machine is used on this tour, though.  No keyboard either.  Not even a<br>

	Hiya David! It was great to finally get to meet you. Damn I had a great time<br>
	at the Butchie shows - Boston was especially fun! Pat was just too cool, I<br>
	can see how you got to know him. He was really friendly and seemed to enjoy<br>
	talking to us all. I take it the rest of the tour went well for you too, eh?<br>
	So tell me, is there really going to be a live album culled from your tapes<br>
	after all? Heh heh...<br>
	<br>
	I've been wearing my fine JB t-shirt around, but so far only one person has<br>
	been cool enough to actually know who it was all about. And I must agree with<br>
	what someone else said, _Condition Blue_ somehow sounds better after seeing<br>
	some of it performed live. Is Pat really going to do a small solo tour? Ahh...<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> there's a mad old boy asleep on my floor
	<p>
	hello everyone.<br>
	<br>
	i caught the last couple of dates of the tour: new orleans and birmingham, AL.<br>
	the guys were obviously a little burnt out after having done the BIG loop<br>
	of north america.  neither pete, the geetarist, nor nick, the drummer<br>
	have solid jobs to return to, so they were a little depressed.<br>
	<br>
	nick more or less voluntarily gave $7 to a stranger while wandering<br>
	drunkenly around the french quarter in new orleans.  the next couple of<br>
	days, band members would walk up to nick and ask to borrow $7.<br>
	<br>
	in birmingham, after the show, a redneck-looking 40 year-old from the audience<br>
	came up to pete and drawled &quot;son, you're too talkative, and y'all're too<br>
	flamboyant up on stage&quot;.  if you had seen this tour, you know that pete<br>
	never moved, never spoke, and stared intently at his frets the whole show.<br>
	<br>
	the somewhat anticipated solo tour doesnt appear to be happening,<br>
	as pat is leaving for home the end of this month.<br>
	<br>
	pat and i have spent the weekend going over the live tapes, and he thinks<br>
	there may be enough to work with as source material for a live album.<br>
	he is thinking about making it more a documentary than a straight live album,<br>
	with bits of interview, in-stores and radio stuff mixed in.<br>
	candidate album titles: &quot;been there, done that&quot;, and &quot;the highlander&quot;.<br>
	(if you are ever in calgary, you must stay at the highlander hotel, btw)<br>
	<br>
	at some of the california shows, there were violinists on stage during<br>
	_racheland_.  if ANYONE recorded these shows, please let me know,<br>
	as pat feels those versions are essential for a live release.<br>
	<br>
	prolly tomorrow i drive him up to chicago with the selected<br>
	songs so that he &amp; martin can clean them up.<br>
	how many times *can* one listen to _angels_ without<br>
	throwing up?  round bout 100 here, feeling nauseous.<br>

	<br>
	${icon_blank}        Not true.  In Dallas, there was a 20-year-old Jazz Butcher fan (I think<br>
	her name was Melinda or Mildred...no, none of those...but it was some kind of<br>
	old-fashioned name that starts with an M...let's call her M.) who brought a<br>
	camera along to the show, hoping to get some good shots of the famous Pat<br>
	whatever-his-real-name-is.  &quot;Do you know if they would mind me taking pictures<br>
	during the show?&quot; she asked me.  I replied that I have a friend who is more<br>
	invasive than that.  (He even makes recordings!)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        When the show began, Pat accomodated the camera by moving close to the<br>
	camera, standing with one leg on the monitor nearby, and striking a number of<br>
	snapshot-ready poses.  I was impressed; not a lot of entertainers would do<br>
	that.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        Later on during the show, Pat began to get grouchy about a poor monitor<br>
	mix (supposedly the drums were too loud) and the fact that he was competing<br>
	against the sound coming out of the two adjacent dance rooms.  It didn't help<br>
	his mood that the crowd kept getting thinner as the night went on, but<br>
	nonetheless it was inappropriate for him to talk one minute about how nice it<br>
	is just to play &quot;pretty&quot; music without all that rock and roll hyperactivity,<br>
	then start griping about the soundman &quot;fucking off.&quot;  Of course, for $6 a<br>
	ticket, the JBC weren't making enough money not to complain about things, but<br>
	whatever mood he was trying to create was not enhanced by his sharp words.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        The other thing I noticed about the Dallas show was the lack of<br>
	promotion.  The only thing I was in the _Dallas_Observer_ about the show was a<br>
	sentence that went something like, &quot;From the U.K. to the U.S. comes the Jazz<br>
	Butcher at Club Clearview, etc.&quot;  Nothing beyond that.  There were some<br>
	die-hard fans there, most of whom found out about the show either by checking<br>
	the club listings in the _Observer_ or some similar entertainment guide, or by<br>
	word of mouth.  Why was the promotion this poor?  Were press releases issued<br>
	and ignored? <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        I guess that Pat is reluctant to capitalize on his association with<br>
	Love and Rockets and the Woodentops, presumably because he stands to lose some<br>
	friends of he started doing that.  That's just a guess, but honestly, I don't<br>
	understand why stuff like that wasn't mentioned in the _Observer_.  The turnout<br>
	might have been substantially better.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        Speaking of ignoring things, upon being told that Dave Whittemore has<br>
	plenty of DAT recordings of Jazz Butcher/Jazz Butcher Conspiracy performances,<br>
	M. expressed an interest in getting in touch with this Whittemore fellow.<br>
	Since I didn't know Dave's address off the bat, I gave her my work number.  She<br>
	hasn't called yet.  Maybe she thought I was trying to hustle her...<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        Oh well; less duping work for Dave to do.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        Ho ho ho, won't she be surprised when she sees my friend's name all<br>
	over the Jazz Butcher live album!  Hee hee hee.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        If anyone knows a 20-year-old Jazz Butcher fan from Dallas whose first<br>
	name starts with an M, give her Dave's address.<br>

	<p>
	Hi David.<br>
	<br>
	So have things returned to normal yet?  Are you adjusting to reality<br>
	fairly well?<br>
	<br>
	According to Pat, Karel and Otto will be<br>
	appearing at the radio station for my one hour special on The Black<br>
	Eg.  Thad (who does the show with me) and I have been working on<br>
	questions for the brothers, and have been collecting the various<br>
	rumors about the Black Eg, so that they can verify or dispel them.  I<br>
	am especially eager to ask them about the large cult of fanatical &quot;Eg<br>
	Heads&quot; who follow them all around Europe, and to ask them about their<br>
	unsuccessful attempt at the Indy 500 time trials in their super-<br>
	charged &quot;Eg-mobile&quot;.  And what's this about Emil being in a<br>
	Ecquadorian prison?  What fun this will be.  <br>
	<br>
	Hopefully, Pat will be able to pass the questions on to Karel and Otto<br>
	before the show on Friday, so that they can add anything else that<br>
	they want to talk about.  One thing I was going to ask them about was<br>
	influences and kindred spirits, and I was hoping that you will have<br>
	given Pat a tape of Vergiftung (for Karel to listen to, of course), so<br>
	that Karel could play a tape of this hot new band he discovered in<br>
	Indiana while they were there for the Indy 500.  Thad is really good<br>
	at designing and drawing, so he is working on a poster for me to copy<br>
	and post around Hyde Park in preparation for the show.  If the<br>
	interview turns out really well, we will probably transcribe it, and<br>
	use the best parts for the quarterly magazine that WHPK puts out.  But<br>
	anyway, I must get back to work now.  Talk to you later...<br>
	<br>

	<p>
	due to overwhelming demand, all of the more interesting bits which<br>
	have been posted to the jbc-list are now available in one big file.<br>
	<br>
	after the tour, when mr fish was relaxing in chicago, he had the<br>
	opportunity to go over this little document. he was chuckling frequently,<br>
	and said that it was more than he had expected from the list.<br>
	reading the section where we all tearing _turtle bait_ apart,<br>
	he yelled: &quot;Lay Off!&quot;.<br>

	yes, this ftp site is about 6 time zones away.  it took about 15 seconds<br>
	to xfer the file when i tried.<br>
	<br>
	while i was in chicago, martin and pat and i went into the studio<br>
	to give the live tapes a preliminary listen.  i got the impression<br>
	that a live release may not occur.  the enthusiasm i saw as he was<br>
	sorting through the tapes here seemed to have faded when he heard<br>
	them on a bigger sound system.  but, martin can work wonders in the<br>
	studio, so there still may be hope.  anything to add, joe?<br>
	i havent heard from martin since i was there a couple of weeks ago..<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> jbc tour 92
	<p>
	All right, all right, I realize I'm horribly delinquent with this, but<br>
	better late, right?<br>
	<br>
	I went to the San Jose (CA) show at F/X. The crowd was quite small to<br>
	begin with, but worse it seemed that at least half the people were just<br>
	there for the opening bands. I don't remember the name of the first<br>
	one, we came in the middle of their set. The F/X has a frightfully<br>
	well-tuned PA system with rather low ceiling which just bounces<br>
	everything straight off of it.  Unfortunately, we were in time to catch<br>
	all of the second opener, one &quot;Mute Angst Envy,&quot; who failed to live up<br>
	to the first part of their name and were way too loud.  An awful gloom<br>
	band in the current grindgoth style. I spent the entire time watching<br>
	their bassist who playing his bass like a rhythm guitar, moving his<br>
	hand faster than the lead guitarist!<br>
	<br>
	But this is all about the Butcher, so we endured MEA and waited patiently<br>
	for the JBC and watched people start to drift out of the club. Pat came on <br>
	and announced &quot;Hi, we're the Velvet Underground. We'd like to thank the<br>
	Mission for opening up for us,&quot; to general amusement and confused looks<br>
	from MEA wandering around in the audience. He also muttered something<br>
	about his band including no former members of Bauhaus. When Partytime<br>
	started (what was that about General Gates?), we went down to the front, <br>
	and more people left. The conspiracy seemed rather subdued and it took a<br>
	couple of songs for Pat to get in the groove. It was interesting watching <br>
	Dooj transform from shy and laid back to Townsend-style licks. It got the <br>
	feeling Pete would've been happier playing behind a curtain off stage, and<br>
	we wouldn't have missed him. He certainly lent nothing to the visual aspect<br>
	of the show.<br>
	<br>
	By the middle of the set, we were down to about 50-60 people in the club,<br>
	most up front. We were quite enthusiastic, though. Best quote of the evening:<br>
	&quot;I love you guys. You're small but perfectly formed.&quot; There were several <br>
	more VU comments throughout the set, including several variations on<br>
	is a song about Margarita but I just want to drink her tequila.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The song list seemed pretty standard, judging by the other comments, although<br>
	we were probably the only ones to be treated to a solo version of &quot;Hungarian<br>
	Love Song.&quot; Someone shouted it out and Pat couldn't believe it. He commented<br>
	that we couldn't possibly want to hear that, which of course got everyone <br>
	cheering and shouting. The rest of the conspiracy just watched in amusement<br>
	as Pat picked out the first verse and chorus, a bit uncertainly, but satisfy-<br>
	ing nonetheless. <br>
	<br>
	The standard set didn't end with Racheland--that was second to last. I think<br>
	She's On Drugs was the last one before the encore (&quot;I think it's time to pick<br>
	things up again&quot;). The encore was Take the Skinheads Bowling and something<br>
	else.<br>
	<br>
	I also caught part of an interview with Pat on the radio (San Jose State<br>
	station). He related a rather humorous tale about Andrew Eldritch of the<br>
	Sisters of Mercy. The Butcher is a Sisters fan, believe it or not. If you<br>
	haven't heard the story, I can attempt to tell it.<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> Greg.Dykema@Eng.Sun.COM (Greg Dykema)
	<br><b>Subject:</b> The Butcher Meets the Prince of Darkness
	<p>
	(I'm not sure I have the time frame right, but this is the gist of it)<br>
	<br>
	It seems one Andrew Eldritch had been spotted in Hamburg (where he lives)<br>
	going to local record stores and buying Jazz Butcher records with his own<br>
	money. Pat was rather surprised and amused to hear this, having no idea<br>
	the Prince of Darkness followed his own work.<br>
	<br>
	Sometime later, the JBC set out on a European tour. Pat noticed that the<br>
	Sisters were also on tour and were playing many of the same venues a couple<br>
	of weeks after the JBC. So Pat starting writing on dressing room walls<br>
	things like &quot;Eldritch, the Butcher is looking for you!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Eventually they arrived in Hamburg (perhaps to record the live album?) and<br>
	Pat gets a telephone call. The deep, dark voice on the other intones &quot;Is this<br>
	the Jazz Butcher?&quot; Pat allows that it is. &quot;This &lt;pause for theatrical effect&gt;<br>
	is Eldritch.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	They chat and it comes out that each is something of a fan of the other<br>
	and they agree to meet in a pub. Pat is quite disappointed to find that<br>
	Eldritch is really a short little guy with a fairly high, abrasive<br>
	voice. At any rate, they have a few pints and Pat just has to ask, &quot;So<br>
	tell me, is the Sisters all just a big joke?&quot; Eldritch just looks down<br>
	and giggles into his lager.<br>
	<br>
	That night at the show they decided to do a cover of &quot;Sympathy for the<br>
	Devil&quot; (I think) and when they get to the part where everybody goes<br>
	&quot;Wooo-ooo&quot; (high voice), everyone's singing along going &quot;Wooo-ooo&quot;<br>
	(high voice) and then Pat over and notices this little guy in black<br>
	leather and black cowboy boots and he's going &quot;Wooo-ooo&quot; (high voice).<br>
	It's the Prince of Darkness at a JBC concert, not going &quot;Wooo-ooo&quot;<br>
	(low, menacing voice), but &quot;wooo-ooo&quot; (high voice) just like everyone<br>
	else. It was great.<br>
	<br>
	And that's the story of the wag and Prince. All references to the &quot;Prince<br>
	of Darkness&quot; are Pat's, not mine, by the way.<br>

	I called Pat a last weekend, and he gave me a laundry list of things<br>
	that he has been working on:<br>
	<br>
	Stuff with Richard<br>
	A single with Sonic<br>
	Stuff with Richard and Sonic<br>
	Stuff with Joe Foster<br>
	And some other stuff I can't remember<br>
	<br>
	Oh yeah.  The JBC plays every week at a local bar.  While Nick is<br>
	officially still the drummer, they use a drum machine at those shows.<br>
	<br>
	I may have to call him back this weekend, since I seem to have lost<br>
	Pete's address.  <br>
	<br>
	Oh yeah.  You now have the ONLY existing copy of the second Black Eg<br>
	album.  Pat said that due to some mysterious circumstances, all known<br>
	copies were erased.  Imagine that.  Do you think he came to his<br>
	senses?<br>
