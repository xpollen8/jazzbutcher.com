  Somehow neglected to mention this before, but I make a cameo appearance on the new album from estimable Silverlake
  Bohemian combo, The Black Watch. The album is called Jiggery-Pokery and is out now on Stonegarden Records. I sing on
  two numbers. See www.stonegarden.com [www.stonegarden.com] for more details.

    Also planning on entering a studio in December with Donald Ross Skinner (of Copey infamy) producing.

  The Tom Hall memorial gig will take place at northamptonshire County Cricket Club, Wantage Road, Northampton              
  on Saturday 6th September 2003.
  http://www.jazzbutcher.com/images/tom_hall_flyer.gif (Pete Watkins)
  Well, Tom Hall's memorial event went off massive style. Estimates of the numbers range from 300 to 500. I reckon it       
  was nearer the latter. It was a big room and it was heaving. It was so crowded that we spent a considerable amount of     
  time out on the terrace, watching through the huge cricket pavilion windows.The evening started with an oration from      
  Alan Moore before settling into an unending parade of talent, including Curtis, Sue Figueroa, Accrington Stanley,         
  assorted Bareback Ryders and Ratcliffe Stouts, the Strung Out Sisters and Tom's son Will, who turned in some great        
  versions. I got to sing John The Road and Kissing & Killing, the latter a right royal rave-up. When there were no more    
  songs to sing Stevie Ward let the tape player rip so that we could all do stoopit wee dances to Tom and Guy's deranged    
  live version of Volga Olga. We signed the guest book and headed off to party all night. On the way home I ran into a      
  man who had come from Australia!    

2003-12-30
  Well, it's finally come to pass. Wilson's "Quality People" appears on the latest compilation from California's Heyday     
  Records, "Straight Through the Sound Barrier", alongside Marty Willson-Piper, Longwave, one David J. and many others.     
  It's out now. Want one? Try www.heyday.com [www.heyday.com] . Or get one off us at one of our gigs. Cheers.

| Master Of Budvar
| 
|   known gigs here:
|   http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/search.html?f=extras&q=nopat
| 
|   Would you consider "Acoustic Allstars" to be distinct from "Masters Of Budvar",
|   or was it simply the initial naming of that spate of events?
| 
|   Can you think of a better description than my "Pat Fish Promotes"
|   for that collection of "Masters Of Budvar"+other shows (that you
|   didn't play at, but promoted)?
|   I'd call them ALL "Masters Of Budvar", except..
|     1) No one knows what the heck that means (but you & yours)
|     2) Some of them were under a different banner, yet highlighted or
|     recommended by you (Tschegg, etc).
|   Sure, I could drop them from the site, but there's an awful lot of
|   neat information in your write-ups for those shows, and they help
|   paint a fuller picture of what you were up to in the aughts.
| 
|   Also, I SWEAR that somewhere I saw that you stated exactly how
|   many Budvar shows there were, and I don't think it was "52" - which
|   is how many are documented on the site - but I can't find the
|   reference. meh - it doesn't matter, I guess.

| 
|   1) There is zero "setlist in full" and next to zero "who played"

|     Apparently, Sumosonic had their live debut ("lots of girls on stage.

| 
|     Does anyone know any more than that?
|

|The gig was on New Year's Eve at the Rocking Horse (the music venue bit at

| WILSON
| 
|   known gigs here:
|   http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/search.html?f=extras&q=wilson
|   (88 of 'em, that's practically a real band!)
| 
|   It would be great if the line-ups were as simple as:
|     from dates A->B, it was ...
|     from dates C->D, it was ...
|   But it probably ain't that simple.
|   I didn't want to assume that everybody played all the time,
|   so most Wilson gigs are currently "player-less".  Help a brother out.
|   Here's some info from email:
|     2001-09-22: "Wilson appear to be holding steady at a 6 piece line-up"
|     2004-02-13: "With Mr. E. Wilson officially retired from active service.."
| 
|   Also:
|   2003-02-15, you said
|     "(There is film of this shit, as, indeed, there is of a lot of Wilson performances. We're going to try and get some of
|     this to you for the site before too long. But this one is particularly scary, coz E-Man is centre stage. Eek! How did
|     that occur?)"
|   Might these films still exist.. and be shared?
| 
| BLACK EG
| 
|   known gigs here:
|   http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/search.html?f=extras&q=eg
| 
|   Which brothers played which gigs?
| 
|   Also - shall this one be construed as an actual black eg gig?
| 
|     http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/1999/Jun2.html
| 
|     (it is listed soley upon an email comment - and it seems odd
| 	that this was 5 years after the brothers' previous outing.)
|     if valid, what was the venue/other details?
| 
| STRANGER TRACTORS, others
| 
|   There are a couple ST gigs here and there. Do they/should they count?
|   http://www.geocities.ws/Nashville/Stage/8818/strangertractors.html
| 
|   You've had your hand in quite a few things at different levels of
|   involvement.  From player to composer to simply liner-note writer.
|   The major projects (eg/sumo/wilson) are fairly well documented.
|   There's some info for a couple stillborn efforts (Vaguely Familiar/Coonce),
|   that could use fleshing out.  (and if there's more Eg material, hey, buddy,
|   that'll always be welcome, 'cuz that shit's good).  Mr Blagdon? I only know
|   about it because Horton Jupiter had some (which I didn't copy in '94
|   when I had the chance).
| 
|   I'm thinking a more proper side-section of the site dedicated to
|   "other projects".  (Currently, you have to hunt around in the
|   lyrics/audio tabs to find it)
|   I imagine the projects section would have explainers for the major ones
|   and a few words about the others.  If you think there's enough 3rd party
|   "played on", etc material, those items could be listed.
| 
|   discogs, for instance, has a (really incomplete/inaccurate) version
|   of what i'm talking about:

|     September with Max and I opening for Stephen Duffy. That one will be open to the paying public, and may turn out to be
|     the only JBC action this year. Details when I have them, sir."
| 
|     Q: did this ever occur?
| 
|   The 2016 gigs - anything you'd like to say about them/songlists?
| 
|   Was the 1998 "Sundaze Festival" held the same place as in 1997?

| 
| All in all, things are in a pretty good state of completeness.
| Thanks for moving stuff my way over the years.
| 
| Let me know if I've got any names/nicknames of people wrong in the
| conspirator's section. "felix graham fudger ray" in particular has
| always been confusing.  "Dave Henderson"? "D.T. Henderson"? That
| sort of thing..  Don't fret about people like Rodney Allen
| being in there.. Eventually, all players credited on albums will
| also show up.  So as to, you know, fully populate the regiment
| you have at your command.
| Your funeral's going to be one hell of a party.
| 
| ANd, finally, here is something that's not yet exposed on the
| site - you can search through the gigs by various data types:
| 
|   http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/search.html
| 

|ASK PAT
|
|	notebook questions:
|
|		"Richard" has been either "Lohan" or "Formby".
|		Is there an easy date-range to differentiate them,
|		or did their timelines cross?  I ask, because I may
|		have a small number of gigs mis-attributed.
|
|		a few mystery tunes:
|
|			"Baby Sister"/"Little Sister"
|				played around '89. covers?
|
|			"Man Sized Bite"
|				is played at several 1987 gigs.
|				is this a codename for a different song,
|				or just one that i've never heard before?
|
|			"Drag Queen"
|				http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/1987/Apr14.html
|
|			"Publicity"
|				http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/1987/May27.html
|
|			"Mandrax Inferno"
|				http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/1987/Aug2.html
|				http://www.jazzbutcher.com/htdb/gigs/1987/Jul28.html
|
|			"Lisa Says"
|				is shown a couple times in 1987, but once is crossed
|				out and "Mind Like A Playgroup" is overwritten.
|				so.. does lisa==playgroup?
|
|		date confusion:
|
|			1) "JBC Concert Chart 1989"
|				13 May - St. Edmunds Hall, Oxford
|				23 May - Zap Club, Brighton
|			Notebook says the above. The website has these two dates swapped -
|			and was sourced from your 1994-06 "All The Gigs" typewritten list.
|			Which version of you is right, 1989, or 1994?
|
|				this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWminqZ3O_k
|				say the date is "1987-03-20".
|				notebook says "Front Door To Babylon", 1987-03-21
|			Do two rights override the notebook, or is the notebook right
|			and the youtube guy maybe got the wrong date from the website?

|	2001-09-22: "Wilson appear to be holding steady at a 6 piece line-up"

|	Is that to say that all 6 played all shows between those two dates?
|
|	More or less...I can recall having to do a gig without Stevie Gordon because he was in Budapest. Curtis
|	would come and go a bit. He was certainly back in the core line-up for the last year or so. Steve
|	Beswick joined on drum kit from autumn 2004. Jonny Mattock would occasionally join us on percussion as
|	well.
