The release of this, the Jazz     Butchers first long play recording, comes after months of     rumour and report of a hot new act with a cool new sound     that leaves the others way way behind.  Now you too can hear     for yourself the new groove that has set the bohemian set     alight - in your own home!  Words alone cannot do justice to     the cordon-bleu treats of the Butcher Beat - so roll back     the carpet and swoop and dive with the fab Butcher Man!     <p />     <b>A Personal Message From The Jazz Butcher</b>:     Well, it's sometime early in the big work ethic on a Friday     morning and I'm hours away from the big bastard!  Looks like     there's precious little time for me to chuck out that work     ethic this weekend.  I've got to be a damned sight sterner     than usual in the old quality control with the discipline     that M.P.s pay high prices &amp; favour for in those suburban     bedrooms, if I'm to make it past the large sheet of paper     with <b>NO MORE MONEY</b> writ large upon it.  Bus?  Train?     - decisions, decisions!  Do we re-do the glockenspiels or     echo the little so and soes out of all recognition - a sound     you never heard before?

Since the recording of <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/bath.html'>Bath Of Bacon</a></b></span> (almost     two years before this one) we had become a 'proper' group.     For all that, we still pooled our skills in the studio,     and this isn't a bad two weeks' work.     <p />     I think that, lyrically, a lot of the songs are a bit     trite and immature, and our inability to take ourselves     seriously is much in evidence.  A record, I feel, of     its time.  We were young(ish) and cocky and I think it     shows.  I still haven't learned to sing on this one,     which bugs me too.  Still, it was cheap and cheerful,     and it helped us to meet an awful lot of people.     <p />     I was told, incidentally, that if we released this on     Glass we could expect a top global sale of 2,000.

Also, having exhausted     the initial stick of JB songs (several of the <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/scandal.html'>A Scandal In Bohemia</a></b></span>     tunes had actually been written at the time of <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/bath.html'>Bath Of Bacon</a></b></span>,     but were rejected back then as needing further development),     I was obliged for the first time to write about my life     as it was at the time, which was very different to the     way I lived when writing the first two records.     <p />     Now I was 'in a band', had left my day job, had been     to Europe... I even started to write songs that were     not self-consciously deferential and mocking.  Hence,     I guess, the arrival of the first recorded 'big ballad'     in <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/rumour.html'>Only A Rumour</a></i> </span>, where David J.  harmonies at the end STILL     give me the shivers.     <p />     I think that now we had started to learn about actually     creating recordings rather than just recording the sound     of a bunch of pals fooling around, and the disc does     have a nice, unified feel. Credit <span class='person'> <a href='/people/john_rivers.html'>John A. Rivers</a> </span> for     his high-speed mixing job.  When I think about it, this     l.p.  doesn't really have any 'great' tunes, in the sense     of numbers that people request or whatever, but it has     a nice totality, a good, atmospheric vibe.

'Hey, mister, can you SEE in them glasses?'  I get to     sing and play things like guitar, sax and piano.     Max does the electric guitar.  On bass is Rolo McGinty,     and Princess Alice Thompson plays the organ.  They're both in     the <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=The+Woodentops'>The Woodentops</a> now, a group internationally recognised as     being the shortest collection of pop musicians in the     world.

The song is by <a href='http://www.base.com/jonathan/jonathan.html' target='new'>Jonathan Richman</a>, but the sentiments     are entirely our own. The 'Twilight Zone Mix' on this     record concerns Max's inability to get from one place     to another without disappearing for long periods.  You've     heard of the Bermuda Triangle?  Well, Max has shares     in it.  <a id='rain'> <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/rain.html'>Rain</a></i> </span>, recorded at the same session,     concerns sex and the weather and the undoubted connection     between the two.

The Prime Minister, a book-burning lunatic, under whose     'leadership' the U.K. has become a police-state satellite     of the most evil and morally corrupt regime in the world.     Locked in the basement in Leamington Spa in steamy August     '84, The Jazz Butcher Group reaches for the cheese wire!

Damn, <b>damn</b> good idea in fact.     <p />     The Jazz Butcher you say?  Yes, of course I remember them,     and mostly fond memories they are too.  It was this very     song with its analysis of Adam Faith as Marxist     revolutionary that broke the mould and them internationally.     Whilst I was roving (as any good reporter must) it was my     good fortune to witness this band on the rise, and I learnt     many things.     <p />     The Jazz Butcher boys were born when Elvis Presley joined     the army; make of those two facts what you will.     <p />     After fraught and frugal years as an eager youth hatful of     songs this very record, only three million times better than     the third Frankie single (an old Queen cast off), signalled     a change in peculiarities and the nation's desire to redeem     its soild past.  The Jazz Butcher was on everybody's lips.     Herpes spread like wildfire.     <p />     They met and charmed everyone, even in 'Hi' society where     they would be forced to tell what Boy George was really like     (yes he bathed every day and yes he washed his hands before     meals) and why pop music no longer meant Doris Day.  Another     cigar Gertrude?     <p />     They wore way out of gear but never fell in love with     Russian spies.  They sang of fish (gills will be gills) and     most importantly, kept Hazel O'Connor locked in a cellar ten     feet down.     <p />     They were pop pirates in the greatest of British traditions.   'Hello there, nightowls, they would say but when the pop     concert ended and the disco resumed life was found to be     wanting.  The police kept telling the kids to move on.     Trouble was brewing; some took umbrage, others 'pep' pills     whilst some took simply outrageous liberties, controversy     fuelling chart success.  Who can forget their third album,     'Doctor Chumley Repents' and the questions asked in the     house?  A battalion of TV screens were kicked in.  Things     had to stop.     <p />     Finally they went too far, waving their winkles at Her     Majesty's Government.  Immediately, and quite     domocratically, their royalties were sequestered.     <p />     Never before in the field of human conflict has so much been     owed by so many to so few.     <p />     The debts linger on, every bit as much as their mass suicide     in Trafalgar Square.  <b>Real</b> men.     <p />     <a href='https://www.mickmercer.com' target='new'>Mick Mercer</a>     <p />     Claudi Bidi writes 'what a load of codswallop!  It was my     great fortune to be intimately acquainted with the Jazz     Butcher and I know for a fact that during those last     desparate years he fell in love with Russian Spies all the     time.'",

He was a berk, but he had a point.  Alan McGee and a number     of people in France, America and The Music Business have     called this one a 'classic album'.  People do, of course,     say much the same about 'Dark Side Of The Moon'.  Can     you hear my flesh creeping?  Germans, on the other hand,     despise it almost universally.     <p />     We were deeply confused young men when we made this record.     Max, Jones and I had all been drinking dangerously for     over a year now, and the poor bass player who replaced     David was finding it almost impossible to keep up with     our twisted thought patterns.

Tragic and sincere     or glib and ludicrous, we recorded EVERYTHING.  Sent     in to make demos for this l.p.  Max and I came out with     <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/conspiracy.html'>Conspiracy</a></b></span> where we squandered a couple of great ideas that     this l.p. so badly needs.  <span class='person'> <a href='/people/john_rivers.html'>John A.

Generally, we had it down in concert.  In     just about every other department, however, we were coming     to bits, individually and collectively, and to me this     record actually shows the morbid state of things at the     time.  Not, of course, that we really noticed any of     this until months later, when, confronted by the realitied     of having been on an accidental two-year intercontinental     binge, we retired damaged, leaving the group in pieces.

His origins remain unclear to     this day.  Some say that he swam to safety from the wreck of     doomed Liberian supertanker Gonzolo; others that he had been     planted by Speznaz to subject the English legal profession.     The most credible theory is that he had formerly been hiding     out in darkest rural Northamptonshire.. plotting.  What was     in his mind is only too blatantly set forth within the     grooves of this disc: A semi-literate pub-crawl through the     swamp of rock's rich tapestry, laced with self-destructive     recreational pursuits and maddened by the buzzing of a     thousand punk rock guitars.     Not that the sound of the Jazz Butcher and his Sikkorskis     from hell (for it is they that are likely to relate to your     scrambled transatlantic notions of what constitutes Le     Pernk).  Press him on the subject and he will sputter     through the special brew, 'of course we're a punk group -     because we do what we want to do' fair.  As they say,     enough.  To me, though, the Butcher's axe grinds somewhere     along the non-existent fusion between soul music and the     sort of dirty pop that failed to make the <a href='http://www.rocknroll.net/loureed/' target='new'>Velvet Underground</a>     famous.  Not that this would take into     account the skiffy suicide that constitutes <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/president_reagan.html'>President Reagan's Birthday Present</a></i> </span>,     or the bittersweet cushioning     that cradels the decidedly neurotic <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/big_saturday.html'>Big Saturday</a></i> </span>.

The first thing     that you have to understand about this disc is that it is     <b>not</b> an L.P.: it is a single and a radio session     nailed together for your amusement.     <p />     The single is on side A and was recorded in May 1988 at 'The     Greenhouse' in London.  It was recorded by <span class='person'> <a href='/people/iain_ohiggins.html'>Iain O'Higgins</a> </span> and     features Mulreany on drums, O'keefe on bass, Kizzy on     guitar, Alex on sax, and me on the rest.  Except for <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/best_way.html'>The Best Way</a></i> </span>     which features Bhang &amp; Olafssen on bass &amp; drums     respectively.  Confused? You ain't heard nothing yet. (Black     betty, bam-ba-lam-ooh-babee a-wop-ba-ba-loo bop-sha-la-la     na-na-na-na early-in-the-morning whoa-dubious-lou-etc.)     <p />     The radio interference may be found on side b, and was     manufactured on 5th June/Juin '88.  It was engineered by     Richard and Yves, and produced by the very wonderful Kevin     Komoda with me breathing hotly down his very patient neck.     Mulreany, O'Keefe, Kizzy and I play and sing with a cameo     appearance from Kevin on organ on <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/girl_go.html'>Girl-Go</a></i> </span>.     <p />     I hope you dig the noises on this record.  That is, after     all, the reason for our making them.     <p />    <a id='spooky'>         In March &amp; April of '88 the Fishpower J.B.C. was on tour in         europe.  One of the great attractions of Eurotrucking is the         hour-or-so of dancing to be had between packing up the         noise-boxes after the show and driving back to the hotel to         get profoundly twisted.  This year, however, we found a         severe shortage of suitable frugging material and so, on our         return to the green unpleasant land, we set about recording         our own 'Dance Record.'  The result is this, you own J.B.C         'Acid Shed' version of Classix Four's <span class='song'> <i>Spooky</i> </span>.  The         idea is that you turn it up very loud indeed and thrash         about in a carefree fashion until it stops.  Check it, as         they say, out.     </a>         <p />     <a id='best'>         In a similar vein comes the Edgar Wallace mix of <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/best_way.html'>The Best Way</a></i> </span>,         a rap which originally appeared on the indisposible         <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/fishcotheque.html'>Fishcotheque</a></b></span> L.P.         This version, specifically aimed at Italian discotheques,         was set down through a haze of paracetemol, codeine &amp; Red         Stripe Lager in defiance of the most apalling toothache         known to mankind, May '88 model.  My thanks to the revolting         O'Higgins for some serious mix magick.  Linguistic note:         'Edgar Wallace' is surrealist rhyming slang for 'serious.'     </a>         <p />     <a id='blame'>         I don't know how it is with you (I lose the capacity to read         or write after 16 hours of touring) but one of our 'great'         British cultural institutions is the vile, gutless, tabloid         gutter-press.  Hence <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/blame.html'>Blame</a></i> </span>, a savagely twisted glance         in the direction of those idiotic '68-88' retrospectives         that were filling up the space between oral-retentive breast         displays and vicious anti-homosexual/drug/human dignity         tirades this summer.  Oh, ask your mum, then...     </a>         <p />     <a id='whitfield'>         Mulreany soirs me up, giggles, and points out that the         chords to <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/whitfield.html'>Whitfield, Sarah &amp; The Birchfield Road Affair</a></i> </span> would be quite at home in the epicene         Steve Miller's <i>Take The Money And Run</i>.  He's         right, of course, but then we never get to hear records         like that in my town.  As it goes,         neither Whitfield of Sarah ever lived in Birchfield Road,         but I did, so I know what I'm talking about.  Those upset by         Sarah's gratuitous demise towards the end of this unpleasant         little narrative will be relieved to learn that she         re-appears, alive &amp; well, albeit with a change of name, in         the story <i>An Idea Of Europe</i>, gathering dust in a         bookstore near you some time in the next ten years. (The         white shirt is important.)     </a>         <p />     <a id='sex'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/sex_engine.html'>Sex Engine</a></i> </span> is a slice of insulting cak with an         interesting ending.

Without the civilising influence of <a href='/people/alex_green.html'>     Alex 'Savage But Reasonable' Green</a>     (already suitably humiliated for absence     on Canadian dates during the previous summer) or the     supertechnopower hot Casio SK-1, this really does start to     get ugly.  Which is just as it should be, really.  Did you     ask your mum yet?  No, well, it's a bit of a problem, I     agree.  Why not just fucking educate yourself instead?     <a id='girl'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/girl_go.html'>Girl-Go</a></i> </span> is for my friend Phil (ip of Walshingham)         Parfitt, singer &amp; writer with <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=The+Perfect+Disaster'>The Perfect Disaster</a> and class A-!         human being.  It is about         a number of things, with special emphasis on the popular         chord 'E'.

This is my favourite recording on this side, owing partly to         Paul &amp; Laurence's zoom groove.  (That's Laurence on         ash-trays, train-spotters.)

We were all aware that music was changing, and, more     out of interest than out of any spurious 'career' concern,     we wanted to see where we could take our pop songs using     things like breakdowns, the mixing in of 'found' voices     (which we first heard NOT from Steinski or the Bryne/<a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=Brian+Eno'>Brian Eno</a>     collaboration, but from John Stapleton, a DJ who scratched   things in at early <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=The+Blue+Aeroplanes'>The Blue Aeroplanes</a>, radical and unexpected changes     of sounds - a series of sonic events rather than plain     old verse/chorus structure.

		"liner": "'<b>Basement</b>'; the word     smacks of oily concrete parking lots, hotel elevators and     bulky, bovine [spongiform] laundry baskets.  The     Basement; as far down as we go.     <p />     It oughtn't, by rights, to have had a garden.  Oh, the     initial impression was just right!  Seedy London     frontage; scrawled cardboard messages by the bell; a     dark, intricate descent through too many doors, perfect     underground T.V. squalor, beyond the mysteries of Edgar     Wallace late at night in black and white and what's that     sudden pain in the small of my back?     <p />     Once through that final door, things would take an     unexpected turn.  I'm entering the chamber now.  Whoa!     The jackal-headed dead!  Excellent!  Music and dancing     and improbable combinations of Czech beer and     Jalapeños!  Doors flung open to an ivied yard where     the randomly seditious lounge on cushions and hoot at the     stars and that singular man next door.  Sometimes friends     of friends would come by and take it for a nightclub.     But it wasn't a nightclub, it was a basement.     <p />     The big red bedford mobile nation state rolls on, and,     rolling, cannot stop.  Miles in darkness to the appointed     spot, deep wold evil dead killers wind shelter: beans,     bitburger and no such thing as noise reduction.  Mules in     the night, mantor and eggulos tremble at the head of the     board, waiting for the great infector to make with the     knife.  Stray Americans, stray steg, nice.     <p />     Dank!  teeth and hair fall out.  Fingernails keep     growing.  The pump is out, the night is dark, we're waiting for Mary.  Don't go out to the beer shack.  Those     jackal-headed dead could be on the lurk.  Voluptuously of     course, it looked like a farmhouse.  But it wasn't a     farmhouse, it was a basement.     ;;Karel Von Dämmerung, Wien;;;;1990",

For all     the pain and crap from which this record was made, the     actual sessions were a gigantic and wonderful party.     <p />     The songs are all long because we (Paul, Joe, Lix &amp; I)     just enjoyed the playing on the 'to-be-faded' bits so     much that it seemed a shame not to let everyone hear     them.  This was warmly received by The Outside World,     less popular among those who counted themselves JBC afficionados.     Well, I couldn't have written it any other way, and I     love that everyone plays on it, so I'm not in much of     a position to know why you don't care for it. All I can     say is that I'm still well pleased with it as a recording,     and as a piece of writing about a tough subject. I mean,     <b>I</b> hate 'divorce rock' too.  It wuz a tough assignment.     <p />     Go on, give the fucker another listen.  The songs may     not make you laugh, but the playing ought to give you     a few thrills. And, after all, I'm not in a band to make     money, or be a 'professional entertainer' - I'm in a band     because I like to play very loud electric guitar.

		"liner": "Karel Von Dämmerung, writer, adventurer and self-proclaimed     beacon of the bohemian gonzo faction, has long been a legend in     the seedier cafes of central Europe.  For many years     his extraordinary fanzine <b>Sinful Beat</b> provided     a lifeline to those in Czechoslovakia and Hungary who     wanted to keep abreast of international music developments,     while his own reckless encounters with authority provided     both hilarity and inspiration to the inhabitants of grimly     over-protective regimes.  Unlikely tales of his personal     crusade on the frontiers of modern pharmacology are legion,     and there was a time when he said to be known by sight     to some two thirds of all the members of the Czechoslovakian     secret police.     <p />     Karel left his native land and settled in Vienna in 1985     after being refused re-entry at Prague airport by the     authorities.  The word is that, returning from some partially     legitimate 'Cultural Exchange' trip to Cuba, he caused     havoc at the Customs desk by presenting the official     with a large bag of high grade ganja and announcing his     intention to import two live Pygmy Crocodiles.  Somehow     he succeeded in obtaining Political Refugee status in     Austria, where for the first time he was able openly     to publish his deranged writings.     <p />     Early in 1989 two events occured which led to the formation     of the combo whose first waxings you are now holding.     First, Karel's two brothers, Otto and Emil, arrived in     Vienna, having taken advantage of the new freedoms introduced     by the enlightened government of Vaclav Havel. Second,     Karel obtained in a second hand store and ancient sequential     circuits drum machine and a primitive sampler.  <a href='https://adjective.com/htdb/eg'>The Black Eg</a> was born.     <p />     After travelling to Italy for the World Cup, where they     did their best to establishthe hitherto concept of Czech     hooliganism, the brothers Von Dämmerung travelled     across Europe, arriving in England at the end of July.     Whilst there, they circulated copies of a cassette they     had made. The general reaction was one of disbelief.     Many people were heard to make rather unkind remarks     about people who took too many drugs.     <p />     The record which you now have in your hands has been     mastered from that cassette.  Recorded on four-track     equipment in bedrooms across central Europe, it makes     no claim towards sonic sophistication.  Indeed it makes     no real claims of any kind whatsoever.  The Brothers     Von Dämmerung are only too proud to retell the story     of how, at their first and only public appearance, at     a bar in Vienna, the proceedings closed in utter confusion     after members of the public, objecting to The Black Eg's     relentlessly tedious version of Morricone's theme to     <i>The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly</i> caused a near riot     when they attacked the band with C.S. gas.     <p />     Nor are the 'band' remotely apologetic for their spectacularly     odd choice of samples.  It is tempting to speculate that     all the loops on this record derive from free review     copies sent to <b>Sinful Beat</b> in the hope of publicity.     Certainly one can detect the presence of the ansaphone machine     on many tracks.     <p />     Since <a href='https://creation-records.com' target='new'>Creation Records</a> acquired the tapes for this album they     have been unable to locate Karel Von Dämmerung or     either of his brothers.  There is a rumour that they     are currently in Los Angeles engaged on some form of     private espionage.  Other sources have them in Vietnam,     looking to collaborate with local musicians on a curious     hybrid of the native folk music and the American Twist     craze which blossomed in the mid-sixties.  Their names     have been linked with that of California's <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=Braindead+Soundmachine'>Braindead Soundmachine</a>     and east coast legend Meathook Wiliams     (Stepfather of the Blues).  It is quite possible that     no more will ever be heard from there shadowy degenerates.     Meanwhile <a href='https://creation-records.com' target='new'>Creation Records</a> is proud to offer this brief and fascinating     glimpse into the world of three foolish central Europeans     who thought they were making dance music.     ;;A.C Lionheart.

I         trust that clears things up a little.     </a>         <p />     <a id='smith'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/smith.html'>Southern Mark Smith</a></i> </span> (Big Return)         Well, the JBC really did get a big return off this         one.  It opened a lot of doors for us in Europe and         America, and listening back now I think I can see         why.  No, I mean that <i>Hammond</i>...     </a>         <p />     <a id='jungle'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/human_jungle.html'>The Human Jungle</a></i> </span>         The title comes from a rather noir little TV series          from the early Sixties wherein the great Herbert Lom         played the extremely sexy and not entirely         unbrilliant Dr. Alexander Kordu, a psychiatrist with         the handy ability to sort out even the most         appalling cases within sixty minutes. I love that         show, but I love touring better.  By the way, anyone         who makes suggestions about sex and travel is being         extremely rude.     </a>         <p />     <a id='girl'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/girl_go.html'>Girl-Go</a></i> </span>         Tu as vu toutes les étoiles?  The JBC lush         out in tribute to the (sadly departed)         <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=The+Perfect+Disaster'>The Perfect Disaster</a>, featuring a superlative         example of the <span class='person'> <a href='/people/richard_formby.html'>Richard Formby</a> </span> guitar assult.  The lead vocal was         recorded in the studio garden at one in the morning         in mid-January.  The reasoning escapes me now.         Probably, I had been very bad.     </a>         <p />     <a id='best'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/best_way.html'>The Best Way</a></i> </span> (Edgar Wallace Mix)         'Edgar Wallace' means 'serious' in surrealist         rhyming slang, which is a good way to describe the         toothache I had when O'Higgins and I did this mix.         Odd barnyard noises may be blamed on the         aforementioned <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=The+Perfect+Disaster'>The Perfect Disaster</a>, who got in there somewhere.     </a>         <p />     <a id='drugs'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/shes_on_drugs.html'>She's On Drugs</a></i> </span>         We were halfway across the rockies in supernatural         British Columbia when I realised that I had never         come across a song with this title before.         Obviously something had to be done.  Dave Francolini         (a wonderful man who should not be allowed to drive)         contributed some of the most hyperactive handclaps         that I have ever experienced.  Then we tied him up         and put him with the others.     </a>         <p />     <a id='tues'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/pineapple_tuesday.html'>Pineapple Tuesday</a></i> </span>         Is it a road song?  Is it a love song?  Is it a         mushy title or what?  I'm sorry, Jesus, every line         is true.  I never enjoyed vanilla as much in all my         life.  Watch carefully: Californian brainfried         road-accident-from-outer-space guitar in the area!     </a>         <p />     <a id='satday'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/big_saturday.html'>Big Saturday</a></i> </span>         The climactic opposite of <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/pineapple_tuesday.html'>Pineapple Tuesday</a></i> </span>,         definitely a Nordic vibe to this         one.  Except for the middle instrumental, which         always makes me think of people hang-gliding in the         Alps: I think it may have been a Martini commercial         that I once saw on TV.     </a>         <p />     <a id='panic'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/panic.html'>Panic In Room 109</a></i> </span>         The desk clerk couldn't believe it.  This drunk         comes staggering into the lobby in the middle of a         thunderstorm and starts wittering in bad German.  To         keep him from dripping all over the place the clerk         hands him a room key.  'Excellent!' burbles the         drunk, 'Room 109!'  The scarey stuff kicked in the         bathroom.  You know, I once spent an evening         indulging heart attacks in a Vancouver hotel room by         pinching my toe.     </a>         <p />     <a id='ptime'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/partytime.html'>Partytime</a></i> </span> (Original)         I guess you could say that this was the first jazz         butcher song ever written.  This recording is almost         ten years old now.  I find it staggering, but there         are hundreds of people out there (I've seen them) on         whom the irony has yet to take effect.  Perhaps it         would help them to know that the events described in         this song ended up with the writer in hospital.  We         all like a laugh, though, don't we?     </a>         <p />     <a id='angels'>         <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/angels.html'>Angels</a></i> </span>         This is still one of my favourites.  I wrote it in         1986 (the day they bombed Tripoli, in fact) about         things that would only come to pass three years         later.  Or something.  Oh God, I never make any         sense when I start to talk about this tune.  The         lyrics just showed up, like automatic writing or         something.  I love it anyway, and I hope you love it         too.     </a>",

		"liner": "<b>Cars Of Destiny</b> - <i>The view from Abington Square</i>     <p />     Built on a swamp, the natives will tell you.     <br />'The Nene Delta' I've heard it called; or 'Murder Mecca     of the Midlands'; or '<span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/chickentown.html'>Chickentown</a></i> </span>.'     <br />Anyone who's ever really thought about the place feels     it deep inside; somewhere in Northampton lies the Heart Of     Darkness.     <p />     Abington Square is more of a triangle, a wide and windy     expanse where, amid a welter of traffic islands, the     Kettering and Wellingborough roads converge.  Marooned on     one such islet stands the atheist M.P. Bradlaugh, still     wagging an admonitory finger at those who would buy their     convictions in bulk.  He was refused his seat in Parliament     because he was not prepared to swear an oath on the Holy     Bible.  Notwithstanding which, the people of Northampton     persisted in electing him over and over again.  Eventually     there was a riot in town, and the Army had to be sent for.     Recently a sad priest, who had clearly lost his flock to the     church of medicine and found the time weighing heavy on his     hands, suggested that the statue of Bradlaugh was a godless     example to the citizenry and should be pulled down.     <br />     On high days and holidays members of the Jesus Army sect     parade around town in paramilitary garb; some of them could     knock poor Bradlaugh down with their breath.     <p />     Perhaps they might pause to look for their special kind of     convert in the War Memorial that looms behind Bradlaugh on     the largets of the chain of islands.  Standing long and low     on its concrete football feet, it is inhabited largely by     advanced cider technologists and those with a nostalgia for     the golden days of glue.  Cars, lorries and buses wheel     around between the islands in a bewildering fashion; it is     possible that some of the denizens of the War Memorial have     been trapped there for some time.     <p />     Across two busy lanes of traffic, at the north-west corner     of the square, stands a bright new building.  It has huge     glass windows, for it is a motor car showroom.  All the cars     in the show room will cost you more than a house round these     parts.  The staff inside, as visible to passers-by as the     vehicles on display, are well turned out young people, and,     in an incongruous effort to bestow a human touch upon their     workplace, they have installed there a large toy leopard.     Or jaguar.  Cars of destiny - the JBC salutes you.     <p />     The November light begins to dim.  Soon it will be time to     spill out of the Racehorse and thrill to the display of     festive lights on the jeweller's shop.  But in an alley     around the back, there is work to be done.  A small man with     a bald head is standing in the remains of the afternoon sun,     holding a ferocious looking whip, the handle of which     appears to be the forelimb of some kind of deer.  He is     surrounded by microphones and a knot of inquisitive small     girls.  A taller man with long hair calls to him from the     roof above: 'You are making... a film, ja?'     <p />     For something strange is happening at The Lodge.  An unruly     association of aging sociopaths is gathering here to commit     their feelings to magnetic tape.  Here, as close to the very Heart Of Darkness as analogue equipment will permit, the JBC     squander Kremlin gold on honeyed dum-dum shells and doomed     archaeological relics through which to filter their erudite     and sickened communiques to the world beyond their most     diseased imaginings.     <p />     And you uncannily, and holding now the results of those     strange days on Abington Square.  Beasts and super-beasts,     phantom truck rides through East and West, the living and     the (jackal-headed) dead, faith and delusion, The Fear Thing     and a whole new theory of earthly evolution.  With glass     doors.     <p />     Real stories with real airbrakes - captured on an intrepid     expedition which took Herr Doktor and his trusty tape     machine deep into the very bowels of the cavernous bus     station early one Sunday morning.  (the time at which most     people disappear.)     <p />     Come trawl the zeitgeist with the JBC, where it's     one-man-one-stick, and a bed of rice really is a bed of rice.

Max Read was engineer for the session, and he also     contributed a lot of the backing vocals. He is a good looking chap,     non-smoker, very able and agreable.

Writer currently unable to establish JBC motives behind this.     Musical Dave, of Northampton combo Ubu Swirl (Do they know that the     JBC call them 'Hobo Swill'?), contributed a spiffy guitar, and there     were further vocal contributions by friends and family. The WOLFS,     I am assured, are not a sample.

		"liner": "<b>From The Sports Desk</b> <hr /> Those who saw the Jazz Butcher's earliest performances might well be forgiven for entertaining the notion that here were farcial drunks with no drummer, best euphemised as 'eccentric' and kept at a distance.  As the highly excitable Butcher and dapper, unflappable guitarist <span class='person'> <a href='/people/max_eider.html'>Max Eider</a> </span> careered from one ill-advised engagement to the next with a constantly changing band of friends, they delivered a series of wildly erratic shows driven by blind faith and the systematic abuse of cheap liquor. It was hard to tell if these people were for real.  They would roll up in an open-top Triumph Vitesse with bits of drum kit sticking out the back.  Sometimes the Butcher would ride the tube to shows, wearing his sailor hat and carrying his guitar in a cardboard box with a huge drawing of E.T. on it.  Of course, it was the only way they knew how. <p /> <a href='/gigs/1984/Jan27.html'>In January 1984</a>, Max &amp; The Butcher were engaged to appear at a London Polytechnic.  The ensuing debacle, fuelled by Carlsburg Special Brew, saw them both walk offstage at different times, and climaxed with their shadowy friend, The Antchrist, shouting pointlessly from a step ladder.  Word is that they found Mister Jones, the drummer, the following day.  Soon after, <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=performer&amp;q=Steve+Musgrove'>Steve Musgrove</a> joined in to play bass and a band existed. <p /> Glass Records supremo David E. Barker had built up some curiosity around the Butcher's deceptively professional early singles, and the group now found themselves playing to people who wanted to see them.  Some were disaffected goths, many were Japanese, one of them was <span class='person'> <a href='/people/david_j.html'>David J.</a> </span>, architect of <i>Bela Lugosi's Dead</i> and eagle-eyed pop detective.  Divid had been watching this nonsense for some time, and soon befriended all the musicians.  With a few dozen beers David signed up 'on loan' to play the bass, and made <a href='/gigs/1984/Apr21.html'>his debut with the band</a> at Alan McGee's <b>Living Room</b> club in a tiny bar in North London. <p /> That was the start of a busy year, from which many of the recordings on this collection come.  David and producer <span class='person'> <a href='/people/john_rivers.html'>John A. Rivers</a> </span> taught the band a host of tricks, resulting in the first really professional Jazz Butcher L.P., <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/scandal.html'>A Scandal In Bohemia</a></b></span>.  The band also developed an agent and a van. David told the group about The Rider, and they saw that it was good.  In December the group climbed under a duvet on the floor of a Ford Transit and headed for their first European Dates.  They played two <a href='/gigs/1984/Dec8.html'>magical</a> <a href='/gigs/1984/Dec9.html'>nights</a> in Hamburg that shaped the lives of many involved.  They drank gluehwein in a lakeside cafe on a Sunday afternoon. The Butcher, whose first reaction to being in Germany had been to hide under a table, had some kind of small epiphany.  They blew all the money in Amsterdam on the way home. <p /> Over seven extremely wintry days in January 1985 the band completed another L.P.  <a href='https://www.mickmercer.com' target='new'>Mick Mercer</a> (who pointed out that these boys were born the year that Elvis joined the army) had once prophesied that the Butcher's 3rd L.P. would be called 'Doctor Cholmondley Repents'.  But they were young, they were headstrong, they called it <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/sex.html'>Sex And Travel</a></b></span>.  It is the sound of a band at the peak of its creativity, and anyone who saw the group on the ensuing British dates would have a very different opinion to one who had watched the Butcher plummet from the stage of <a href='/gigs/1983/Nov23.html'>the Embassy back in 1983</a>. <p /> Spring 1985 was time for David to go.  The man called <span class='person'> <a href='/people/felix_ray.html'>Felix Ray</a> </span> arrived with his big Italian acoustic bass, and the endless touring began.  Between March <a href='/gigs/1985/index.html'>1985</a> and December <a href='/gigs/1986/index.html'>1986</a> the Jazz Butcher group played over 200 shows in 12 countries. They took to the life of the amplified itinerant with gusto, even surviving an early setback when the bus seized up in rural Sweden, forcing them to travel in a group with as much equipment as they could carry by train to the next date... <a href='/gigs/1985/Mar31.html'>in Zurich</a>.  They survived, but only just.  And Felix no longer believes that Switzerland is next door to Sweden. <p /> The band took to Europe and vice-versa.  There were festivals in tents with people waving flags, lost weekends in Vienna, mad nights in dimly remembered nightclubs, and vodka everywhere.  There was chocolate cake all over Room 27.  '<i>In Europe</i>', beamed The Butcher, '<i>They treat you like a human being instead of a musician</i>'. <p /> They still had their special nights.  A show in Sicily ended with the amplifiers on fire and the Butcher so drunk that he thought he'd got religion.  There was a first, brief foray into Spain that saw three of the group return physically wounded and drained of all bodily fluids.  As they leaned, croaking, on the Heathrow travolator, they were passed by a planeload of Japanese tourists, each one fresh as a daisy and keen to take a look at their first English person. <p /> In the summer of 1986 the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, as they now called themselves, found themselves headlining at a <a href='/gigs/1986/Jul3.html'>festival of Italian Communist Youth in Naples</a>.  After the show somebody asked the Butcher '<i>Where are you playing next?</i>' and he found himself having to reply '<i>New York City</i>'.  For Barker had been busy, and unbeknown to the group, <a href='/albums/nonsense.html'>a compilation of their work</a> was shooting up the American alternative charts. They arrived, bewildered, <a href='/gigs/1986/Jul17.html'>in New York</a>, to find their album at Number 2, and muddled their way through the North American summer, playing at the top of their form, drinking out of brown paper bags, and striking terror into the Americans by wearing long trousers. <p /> Felix left to court a lady in Montreal, and was replaced by <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=performer&amp;q=Richard+Lohan'>Richard Lohan</a>, while <span class='person'> <a href='/people/alex_green.html'>Alex Green</a> </span>, an associate of David J., joined on saxophone.  <span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/distressed.html'>Distressed Gentlefolk</a></b></span> was released in October 1986 and the five piece band that toured Britain and Europe in support made a mighty sound; but it was not to last.  <a href='/gigs/1986/Nov27.html'>On a particularly grim night in Switzerland</a> too much liquor, fatigue, stress and frustration drove Max and the Butcher to engage in a spectacular outbreak of dressing-room-fu, which resulted in Max receding from view on a train the following morn.  The remaining members finished the tour, the last show being in <a href='/gigs/1986/Dec20.html'>Zaragoza on 20th December 1986</a> <p /> Mister Jones moved to Germany, where he found new fame gardening for Gunter Grass, playing for the Lost T-Shirts of Atlantis and for his own band, Shakespeare And The Bible.  <span class='person'> <a href='/people/max_eider.html'>Max Eider</a> </span> released his solo L.P., <span class='release_title'><b>The Best Kisser In The World</b></span> in the summer of 1987, but was ill-served by his record company.  He can still be seen playing live in London and Hamburg.  <span class='person'> <a href='/people/david_j.html'>David J.</a> </span> is in <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=Love+And+Rockets'>Love And Rockets</a> and Felix is a photographer.  The Butcher and Alex Green resurfaced about a year down the road on <a href='https://creation-records.com' target='new'>Creation Records</a>. <p /> In the years they recorded for Glass Records the JBC made four studio albums, <a href='/albums/hamburg.html'>a live L.P.</a> and eight singles, none of which have been available for almost ten years.  This collection offers some of the best moments from that period.  From the primitive early sound of <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/bigfoot.html'>Bigfoot Motel</a></i> </span> (where the Butcher plays drums) to the elaborate soundscapes of <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/domestic_animal.html'>Domestic Animal</a></i> </span> and <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/angels.html'>Angels</a></i> </span> it charts the progress of a gang of friends who stumbled unprepared into a music scene of which they were often deeply suspicious, but which gave them more then they had ever imagined.  Here is music that won the admiration of figures as wildly diverse as Mark E. Smith, Tom Waits, REM, Andrew Eldritch, and Alan McGee. Heartfelt, thoughtless tunes of classic pop, high on hedonism and sharp of tongue: 'eccentric' perhaps by the meretricious standards of the times, but they've nearly all got drums.  Come a little closer, and enjoy. ;;Karel <span class='person'> <a href='/people/von_dammerung.html'>Von Dämmerung</a> </span>, Ho Chi Mihn City;;;;1996-05",

It is Tuesday.  Like elephants, the JBC do     not forget.  They agree that this would     make a fine soundtrack for a film of     their bus driving down a long, straight     desert road somewhere in Spain.     </blockquote>     14. <span class='song'> <i><a href='/lyrics/shirley.html'>Shirley Maclaine</a></i> </span>     <blockquote>     We're right in the middle of the 1991     firestorm here.  <span class='person'> <a href='/people/alex_lee.html'>Alex Lee</a> </span> (Gibson 335) and     <span class='person'> <a href='/people/richard_formby.html'>Richard Formby</a> </span> (sixties science-fiction Vox affair)     do battle in a darkened room full of toxic fumes.

		"liner": "The last thing anybody expected was a new Jazz Butcher album in the     year 2000.  But there is one, and it's just the sort of thing that you     hardcore JBC listeners are going to enjoy.  Stick with me.     The record is called 'Glorious and Idiotic' and it is released on 26th     January 2000 on ROIR (Reach Out International Records) of New York City.     That's right, Virginia, it's a domestic US release.  It is a live recording     of the concert which Max and Owen and I played in Hamburg's Logo club     in February 1999.  It marks Owen's return to the JBC, and, in retrospect,     it marks the return of the JBC itself as some kind of going concern.     It has by far the best sound quality of any of the Jazz Butcher live     albums or bootlegs currently available.  The performances aren't bad     either, for a bunch of old bastards.  It features lots of old favourites     and two brand new songs by Max Eider, both performed for the first time     ever at this concert.  It also features guest appearances from our Euro-buddies     Clemens, Curtis and Pat Beirne, three of the finest human beings you     could be lucky enough to meet (by the way).",

I've always been a Butcher fan, although     it's no secret that there was a brief period when I would have liked     to have killed him, dismembered his body, buried the parts at the four     corners of the earth and visited each in turn to have a bit of a dance.     I felt sure he would have done the same for me.  <i>[Actually, I never entertained     these kind of thoughts about The Talented One, but now that he comes to     mention it, it does sound like a bit of a laugh - Ed.]</i>     <p />     But that was a long time ago.     We never quite cut the knot, and so it is - through a strange mixture of complicity,     happenstances, hard liquor and Vinyl Japan - that we cam to make this record.     We have nothing but good to say of Vinyl Japan, but I'm sure they won't mind     my pointing out that it's been made     on the cheap.  This involved Pat in becoming a bass player and virtual     drummer, among other things (leave it, Crouchy), and I had many happy visits     to Northampton NN1 to pursue conversations such as: 'Barrapadap.' 'What,     brapadap?' 'No, barrapadap.' 'Oh, barrapadap ... I see.'     <p />     Anyway, the main purpose of these notes is to give thanks and thanks are     primarily due to co-conspiratorial guitar player <span class='person'> <a href='/people/peter_crouch.html'>Peter Crouch</a> </span>, who owns the     house and a good deal of the equipment and patience that made this record     possible.

Little     Jake and Hobbu thank Richard Morris.  And then there's you, of course, assuming     that you've actually shelled out some of your hard-earned cash to listen to     this product of disgusted, disappointed, dissipated and rotten souls.     <div align='right'>     ;;Max Eider;;;;2000-04 </div>",

		"liner": "In March 1985, when <span class='person'> <a href='/people/david_j.html'>David J.</a> </span> joind <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=act&amp;q=Love+And+Rockets'>Love And Rockets</a>, the Jazz Butcher Group introduced     their new bassist <span class='person'> <a href='/people/felix_ray.html'>Felix Ray</a> </span> to a hundred or so unconcerned punters in a conference     suite in a Northampton basement.     <p />     Soon after that night, promoted by ace photographer <span class='person'> <a href='/people/mitch_jenkins.html'>Mitch Jenkins</a> </span> (who also happened     to be the Butcher's flatmate at the time), the Hand Of Hinc intervened, with the     result that the band swiftly grew accostomed to ceaseless touring, stumbling and     shouting their way across England, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Austria,     Switzerland and Spain.     <p />     Sometimes they would play two shows in the same evening.  Sometimes there was trouble     'Is he always like that?' was becoming something of a catch phrase.  It had reached the point where,     if he wasn't actually playing a show or making a record, the Butcher would spend his time shouting     at his long-suffering agent down the phone because, frankly, having 'gone professional', he no     longer had anything else to do.     <p />     But the summer of 1985 was good to the JBC in a violent sort of way.  Despite the many injuries     sustained during the band's first brush with Spain, they were in high spirits.  Possibly they     thought they were indestructible.  (Given that at the time of writing they have just completed     their seventh US tour and their first club dates in Japan, perhaps they are.  We may never know).     <p />     So let us join our ungainly crew as they jet off one September Friday with a view to playing     a festival date in the south of Germany <a href='/gigs/1985/Sep7.html'>the following night.</a>     Having been met by their promoter,     a very small man in a very large Mercedes, the band are delighted to discover that the     festival is in a tiny Alpine village rejoicing in the locally typical but nonetheless     laughably quaint name of Trochtelfingen.     They drink like sailors and demand money with menaces from the promoter (successfully,     as it goes, poor mug!) before retiring in a polite and orderly fashion to their small,     charming, family-run village hotel.  Friday night in Schwaben.  No problem at all.     <p />     Saturday dawns bright and lovely.  The hotel is all abuzz, for there is to be a wedding.     The JBC nod and beam sweetly at the natives before leaving to do a lunchtime soundcheck     in a massive candy-striped tent in an Alpine meadow.  It is a fine, professional soundcheck,     it goes on for awhile, during which the band do not waste the opportunity to renew their     still fresh and passionate affair with German beer.     <p />     In the afternoon the band's German agent, Joachim, takes the JBC to the extraordinary     Schloss Liechtenstein nearby.  As they explore the mad fairy-tale castle perched high on a     cliff above the village, The Butcher and <span class='person'> <a href='/people/max_eider.html'>Max Eider</a> </span> are faintly spooked while Felix beams, resplendent     in grey leather trousers, black shirt open to the waist and fake leopardskin jacket.     <span class='person'> <a href='/people/owen_jones.html'>Owen Jones</a> </span> is nowhere to be seen, but those who are curious about his movements are     recommended to check out his recordings with his band Shakespeare And The Bible.     The posse sits and smokes thoughtfully under a huge and ancient tree outside the castle.     It is a peaceful and idyllic afternoon.  With beer.     <p />     In a disturbing prophetic photograph the JBC can be seen posing at the castle gates.     The Butcher is good-naturedly throttling his German agent, while <span class='person'> <a href='/people/kizzy_ocallaghan.html'>Kizzy O'Callaghan</a> </span> is     taking the opportunity to thrust his half-eaten Mars Bar into the singer's ear.     <p />     It is around teatime that the cracks begin to show.  Returning to the hotel, the JBC     discover a number of things and the number is four:     <br />1. The wedding party is in full swing in the restaurant.     <br />2. There is a trolley loaded with all manner of elaborate     German cakes just sitting there all on its own in the hall.     <br />3. The newlyweds have left their hotel room door open.     <br />4. Nobody is paying any attention to the JBC     <p />     Felix is straight into action.  Seeing that many of the cakes     have already been partially eaten, he figures that nobody is going to miss them, now.     With commendable foresight he decides to liberate a few of them for later in the evening, in case     anyone feels a bit peckish, like.  It is while stealthily concealing the cakes in Room 27 that he and     the Butch find the happy couple's door open.  Within minutes their bathroom is entirely stuffed     with the hotel's extensive collection of massive pot plants, with a large and elaborate model boat     awaiting any intrepid expolorer who makes it as far as the bathtub.     <p />     As the sun goes down the JBC slip discreetly from the hotel and up to the massive candy-striped tent.     Here all is rock and roll, although, with hindsight, the photographs do indicate that the stage     lights might have tended towards a possibly unnecessary shade of hot pink.  Still, the JBC     rock the tent, take the cash money and continue their research into the amount of     vodka that can be poured down the singer's throat.     <p />     The Butcher doesn't know it yet, but he has already eaten the last meat that will ever     pass his lips. As the band troop into a local restaurant for a well-earned dinner     the excitable singer spots a tank full of live crayfish.  'Uh-oh' he thinks, 'Its' a     Which-One-Would-You-Like-Murdered-And-Delivered-To-Your-Plate Sir Scenario'.     <p />     In a fit of well-meaning but spurious solidarity The Butcher joins Messrs Eider and Jones on the     vegetarian tip.  It later transpires that the crayfish are, in fact, house pets.  By     such misunderstandings do we change our lives.     <p />     Back at the hotel, all is quiet.  Sadly, it appears that the band has missed the shrieking     from the bridal suite.  The JBC gather for vodka and cake in Room 27.  The mood is satisfied,     peaceful. There is happy, animated conversation and none of it is about trashing hotel rooms.     Drinks and cakes are passed around.     <p />     There is no way of predicting the moment.  The Butcher is sitting on the floor,     leaning against Felix's bed enjoying a massive and particularly well-preserved     chocolate cake when in a moment of festal stupidity he makes the fatal mistake     of taking a tiny lump of chocolate and flicking it towards the lead guitarist.     In seconds Eider is upon him, seizing the cake and grinding it in its entirety into     the hapless Butcher's face forever.  It all goes off.     <p />     Remember: these are men who have had their whole lives in the shadow of the Cold War Bomb.     They understood concepts like 'escalation' and 'massive pre-emptive strike'.  Within     minutes large areas of Room 27 are chocolate-plastered no-go zones and Eider finds himself     forcibly imprisioned in the bathroom, a wardrobe pushed up against the door for     added security.  He responds as any reasonable man would under the circumstances.     He riots.     <p />     Negotiations go on for some time before The Talented One succeeds in arguing his     way to freedom.  Sadly not for the first time European treaty is soon betrayed     and once again appaling cake abuse breaks out.  By now there is not a white surface     in the room.  Eventually the Konditoreisturmgruppe runs out of vodka and curls     up in the wreckage to sleep.     <p />     At an unusually early hour on Sunday morning the JBC are in the car park, loading     into the back of the van.  They move suprisingly quickly and silently for men in     their condition.  Kizzy and Mister Jones have spent the last half hour desperately stuffing     slick brown bedclothes into the wardrobe of Room 27.  As they make their final exit from     the hotel they pass a pair of young chamber maids heading in the opposite direction.     Just as they gain the lobby they hear a great and deeply comical shriek from upstairs.     <p />     The JBC bus goes tearing out of the car park, headed for Stuttgart Airport at some speed.     After some five or ten miles the band spot a German Police car on the road behind them.     Giggling hysteria is not far away as the tour manager puts on his best German accent     to announce: 'Ja... we would like to have a word with you about some... cakes.'     <p /> ;;Pat Fish;;;;2001",

		"liner": "<b>FREE LUNCH</b>     <p />     Curtis E. Johnson once said to me about the JBC: 'You're not a band. You're     a crack team of international restaurant critics.' Guilty as charged.     Stevie G and I were talking about it just the other day. All over the world     you can meet people, who, in a desperate attempt to let you know that     they're bang up to date with what's going on out there, will tell you:     'There's no such thing as a free lunch'; whereas to us musicians the free     lunch is a central shaft of our cosmology.     <p />     Next time some patronising time-server feels like letting you in on the Big     Secret and tells you 'there's no such thing as a free lunch', buy him one.     Take him to a restaurant, sit him down, wine him and dine him. Then send     him on his way with the Star of India's finest dhansak in his belly and a     flea in his ear. Who knows? You might just have tweaked his worldview a     point or two towards the sunnier side of the street. You'll certainly have     shown him that he didn't know what he was talking about.     <p />     There is the remote possibility that, once the espressos have been drained     and it's time for you to shell out, your new companion might try to go for     his wallet. 'No, no, I couldn't possibly let you pay the bill,' he     declaims. Waving of hands may be involved. Here is a man in particular need     of your immediate and practical help. Here you are, trying to pay for his     lunch, but his personal Weltanschauung won't permit it. How far up himself?     All the way, I'm afraid, season ticket holder, sits on the board of the     Consumers' Action Council, organises the knees-up every Christmas, salt-of-     the-earth.     Oh, I'm sorry. Remain firm. Pay the bill for both of you.     <p />     Alan McGee, in his foreword to Jackie Young's book 'Backward Glances'     (Creation 1995), wrote that whenever one of his deluded pop singers phoned     up from abroad to moan about life on the road, he'd remind them that they     could always try working down a mine. Right on the money once again, Mister     President.     <p />     A lot of the stuff you read about little rock bands touring the globe is     foolish myth. The expected tales of wild excess, for example, perpetuated     by writers who could barely handle the lifestyle for more than a couple of     days at some cushy location carefully selected by the record company, which     is paying their fare and their minibar bill. Then we have to wrestle with     the myths of Dreadful Squalor. These tend to be perpetuated by a certain     kind of musician, who can't handle the lifestyle either, God bless, but who     has sublimated this beneath a preening self-importance which renders     perfectly good gigs, hotels, vehicles and restaurants into an unending     slough of Things Which Are Not Good Enough For Him. (Or Her, Miss Carey.)     For example, has anybody ever read 'Nico; Songs They Never Play On The     Radio' without having, ever so fleetingly, the feeling that something is     up? If things are truly as vile and debased as the author likes to make     out, doesn't that make him just a bit of mug for being a part of it? Or is     he taking a hypocritical pot-shot at his old touring companions?     <p />     He does, it must be said, paint a glorious picture of The Great Paolo     Bedini.     <p />     Paolo Bedini is one of the truly wonderful things about touring what the     ignorant, the ungrateful and the chemically-dependent like to describe as     'the toilets'. A chess prodigy, he was thwarted when his mother wouldn't     permit him to go to an important championship in the Soviet Union, so     somehow he became a music promoter. Paolo stirs two teaspoonfuls of sugar     into a small glass of orange juice. For some time the windscreen of his car     was held on by gaffa tape.     <p />     When you work for Paolo you enter a zone of un-knowingness, where matters     like time and space are seen from a completely different, serenely detached     viewpoint high in the foothills of modern Italian consciousness. If you     persist on trying to follow your normal, sadly materialist agenda, you will     find yourself growing ever more confused and frustrated, as you try to     establish     <p />     Where you are now;     The relationship between where you are now and where you are, in fact,     supposed to be now;     Where you are supposed to be later on;     When that might be;           and     What you should be doing to ensure that it might be so.     <p />     It is hot in Italy and if you think this way you will go mad. Your brain     will shrivel to the size of a walnut and you will die alone and insane in a     sanatorium just outside of Guildford as the crows on the plane tree outside     your window say vile things about your evil, useless life.     <p />     The truth is that there is learning, enlightenment and many free lunches to     be had from a Bedini Special. In September 1985 the JBC were flattered to     land a show in the ancient Greek ampthitheatre in Syracusa in Sicily. (Call     that a toilet, if you dare.) The PA caught fire and the show ended in     enthusiastic pointless shouting and the singer getting a visit from Jesus.     The following morning all the members of the JBC and their hangovers were     told that they could not fly home on the appointed aeroplane, something of     a nuisance, which the bass player darkly intimated to be work of the Mafia.     'So, if they don't like us.why do they want to keep us here on their     manor?' reasoned the marginally more logical players. We sat and drank     coffee in the airport while Bedini was sent for.     <p />     We knew that Paolo would have a scheme. On this occasion it turned out that     the first step was to book the entire band onto a flight to Milan. This was     achieved without too much difficulty. Arrived at Milan, we watched open-     mouthed as a van was rented. We then drove through the gathering twilight     across hill roads to Genoa. A plane would take us home from Genoa airport:     this was the not-entirely-convincing official line from our promoter. Of     course, we arrived to find Genoa's tiny airport closed up for the night. It     must have been at least eight thirty in the evening.     <p />     Entirely unphazed, Paolo had us drive on into Genoa where he booked the     whole crew into a downtown hotel before taking us out to dinner. We could     not believe our luck. He was acting as though it was the most normal thing     in the world.     <p />     Over dinner, which, being Italian, was exceptionally fine, Plan B was     revealed to a shell-shocked and disbelieving band. Pretty self-evidently,     all this piling around Italy in various forms of transport had taken     something of a toll on the finances, and Paolo explained that it would be a     lot easier and cheaper for him to send the band home in separate groups of     two or three by train. One or two could go tomorrow, the others a day or     two later when Paolo had sorted out the necessary wedge. It was decided     that Max and Owen would be the first to set off, the following morning. The     rest of us got to stay in the hotel for two or three days, milling around     Genoa (which is lovely) and meeting up regularly with Paolo for endless     free lunches and dinners. I still can't believe my luck.     <p />     Later, back in the UK, I found out that the reason that Paolo acted so     calmly, as though everything was normal, was that - as far as he was     concerned - it was. My pal Rolo had had an almost identical experience with     Il Gran Bedini only a few months before. Days of free lunches! What a     gentleman! The JBC loved him so much that we named an Award after him,     specifically the Award for local promoter of the year, which from 1985 on     became known as The Golden Bedini.     <p />     And while I'm talking about Italy, a big shout must go out to our friends     and supporters, Giancarlo Susanna and Leo Mansueto, without whom all our     Italian adventures would probably never have come to pass, and I would     never have met Paolo Bedini.     We love you!     <p />     The great truth of all this is that life on the road is positively     luxurious in comparison to the lives that most musicians live when they are     not working. You get to stay in hotels, eat out in restaurants, learn     languages, history and politics. You get to show off, you drink stupid     quantities of free liquor, you get into nightclubs for free. You get to DJ     on foreign radio stations (Once, in Wisconsin, they even let me read the     news), the gas stations sell beer, cigarettes are cheap and the drugs are     free. Let's face it, the only people you ever meet are the ones that either     like your music or have to pretend to as part of their job. (Well, them and     The Authorities.) All you have to worry about is where you are supposed to     be at six o'clock tomorrow evening.     <p />     All right: strictly, the touring musician adventurer tends to enjoy a lot     more free dinners than lunches, when kindly local promoters try to feed you     up in readiness for el gran espectacolo del rock. I once knew a German tour     promoter who thought it was a very dubious idea for the drummer to be a     vegetarian. And, yes, it's probably true that these luxurious dinners out     are accounted for in some contingency fund among the promoter's expertly     and cautiously calculated expenses; but it's not as though you, the     musician, will ever see any of that paperwork. No, from where you're     sitting, that is near enough to a free lunch for jazz. And over the years,     the JBC have enjoyed some very good ones.     <p />     I've heard and read terrible stories about British bands going abroad and     complaining incessantly about the absence of good old Kwiksave favourites     like Captain Birdseye or canned beans. There are the tales, almost too sad     to be told, of allegedly creative people dragging a massive tea urn around     with them wherever they play. Just about everybody in the JBC was happy to     make do and mend with whatever came along in the way of food and drink,     and, having gazed thereupon, I'm not surprised.     <p />     Years after the event, certain dinners stand out every bit as strongly as     certain shows. It is time to give credit where it has been due.     <p />     <b>Taberna Bar Bajamar, Calle Gorbea, Gasteiz - Spring 88</b>     <p />     Simple, unpretentious, endless dining delight, served by a telepath.     A legendary dining experience, universally agreed by all who were there to     be the finest meal that this band has ever been served.     <p />     <b>Restaurant Kalash, Clermont-Ferrand - Spring 94</b>     <p />     A Pakistani restaurant of staggering sophistication in a back street in     France's answer to Sheffield. An unexpected oasis of calm and civilisation,     to be sure, but the food was so delicate, so delicious, so plentiful that     it remains unforgettable.     <p />     <b>The Opera Nutter, Reggio nell' Emilia - December 1986</b>     <p />     Somewhere in the countryside the Red Bus pulled up at a barn. A barn with     flashing disco lights and opera playing at brain-crushing volume. In these     unlikely surroundings we were served endless courses of transcendentally     good Italian peasant cooking by a dangerous maniac. I can hardly believe it     really happened.     <p />     <b>God-Fearing Erie, Pa. - Spring 2000</b>     <p />     In a guerilla-booking operation, a pack of JBC lovers invited us to play     their local pub, using their flat as a base camp. Here they installed their     pal, who just happened to the head chef at the best restaurant in town.     Roasted elephant garlic with brie and custom-made quesadillas, all     accompanied by beers of the highest quality, Polish vodka and jazz     cheroots, while watching Premiership football on TV - in America! Superb!     <p />     <b>Vereinhaus, Dornbirn - Mar 88</b>     <p />     When the JBC first stumbled upon this fine Austrian dining room at Easter     1985 we discovered that they did a rather wonderful thing with deep-fried     mushrooms. We have been going back there ever since. Of course, these days     'breaded mushrooms' have come to the pubs and restaurants of the UK. But     what a nasty little mess of microwaved cack they truly are when compared     with the Real Thing. Available only at the Vereinhaus, a JBC classic!     <p />     <b>Honorary mentions must surely also go to:</b>     <p />     <a href='/press/20020709_starindia.html'>The Star of India</a>, NN1<br />     Indian Veg, Chapel Market, Islington (the two great originals for us lot)<br />     Scholars Inn, Bloomington, Indiana (well classy)<br />     Himalaya, Madrid (our base over three mental days in 1991)<br />     Seoul Restaurant, Druselplatz 2, Kassel (surprise fruit a speciality)<br />     Weinstein, Aachen (snakes on the piss!)<br />     Scenic India, San Francisco (featuring Flying Horse beer)<br />     Mr. Jones' &amp; Fraulein Nudow's Kitchen, Hamburg (too right!)<br />     Restaurant Tibet, Hamburg (wear clean socks)<br />     Elmer's Diner, Portland Oregon  (chilli relleno omelette of the millennium)<br />     Black Bear Diner, Eureka, California ('I could handle a logger right now.')<br />     Joseph's,Yucca &amp; Ivar, LA, California (breakfasts of genius)<br />     Citrouille, Morlaix, Brittany, France (it's all about the pumpkins)<br />     Hotel Regina, Vienna (imperial breakfasts)     <p />     Thank you all.

		"liner": "<b>LAST OF THE GENTLEMAN ADVENTURERS</b>     <p />     The Cuban heels are worn down to their cuticle and the spring-loaded derringer has rusted in position up a shiny sleeve. Crows bowl across the Racecourse like black boa tumbleweeds and far too many of the other wanted-poster names are long since taken down: that absent rack of painted clogs in Birchfield Road, an admixture of alcohol and DNA still percolating through Jack Lansbury's spit-trap, Freddy Fingers' glass eye rolling to a standstill on the empty dance-floor, all gone, all auditioned for the Boot Hill Boogie Boys or otherwise dispersed. Inside the legendary saloon, its bar-length mirrors and its framed reclining nudes all plasterboarded now, conviviality swept out through a swing door the moment everybody's cards were on the table. This must be the famous palace that those four-lane highways of excess were always leading to, that makes a body scrape a chair up and take stock.     <p />     With blood from an interminable improv on his cleaver ... people say he uses every last bit of a slaughtered solo clarinet except its squeal ... the Jazz Butcher, one of this threadbare island's greatest living songwriters, herein purveys his choicest cuts. All left to hang as part of their extensive maturation process, melodies so tender that they're falling off the bone, a gamey sweetness in the lyrics, this sumptuous salmagundi has the flavour of a signature dish, something left till last.     <p />     A work that speaks from a hard-earned perspective and means every word of it, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers is a delightfully ill-humoured reassessment of contemporary culture and the dwindling amount of room remaining for a gentleman adventurer within it. From the atavistic primate yearnings for a vanished jungle-land in `Animals' to the elegiac message-in-a-bottle bobbing on an eerie Californian surf in `Shakey', what we're offered is a scuffed and well-stamped passport to the gone world, stained with Tokay, singed by oval cigarettes you'll never see again. The fatalistic Gallic shrug of `Tombé dans les pommes' lifts a dismissive brow at life's vicissitudes, while `Count Me Out' speaks of the dignified withdrawal from a situation that's no longer either interesting or acceptable.     <p />     Far from a weary resignation letter, though, the pieces here more accurately represent a flinty and determined manifesto, a defiant staking out of the unsupervised and teeming wasteland to which our illustrious former territory has been reduced, a vital roster of remaining freedoms. Whether that be in appreciating the bohemian elan of next-door's quadruped or instigating a romance we may be hard pressed to survive, these songs are testimonials to life, perhaps especially to life at bay. The bluesy and relentless rocket of `Solar Core' provides a glorious reminder to select our destination carefully, and never be found wanting in ambition. `All the Saints' and its affecting coda spell out the emotionally conservationist agenda, with a spirited dismissal of irrelevant modernity in favour of pursuing vitally important individual dreams.     <p />     This luminous, enduring truth resides at the collection's beating, beaten heart, reiterated eloquently in the title track itself, curling its lip at those who have mistaken BUPA and increased consumer choice for liberty, inciting us to man up and define that precious resource for ourselves. With Messrs Harries, Eider and Mattock as his bearers, the last of the gentleman adventurers here buckles up his pith-helmet and mounts a reckless foray into the interior, heads in the last remaining unexplored direction, the implicit fifth point on our compass. Follow at your peril, from the trail of snapped conventions left behind him, to a province still outside captivity. I'll see you there.     <p />     Alan Moore<br />     Northampton<br />     September, 2012<br />",

After years of wandering, confused, through the digital wreckage of the record business, we have alighted upon this brilliant model for getting our music to those who want it most. So here we are, appealing to you to help us front up the necessary for the recording and manufacturing of that album. <p /> The record will draw on the best of Pat’s compositions since the recording of Rotten Soul back in 2000. Unlike that album, it will be made in a proper studio with the best producer we know. <p /> By pledging here you secure your copy of the album. Think of it as a kind of long-term pre-ordering system. We also have some interesting exclusives to offer, from a signed lyric sheet to Pat’s Fender El Rio guitar. Check out what’s on offer in the sidebar. <p /> If we’re lucky enough to attract more than our target amount, we shall be making a donation to the Citizens’ Advice Bureau. Anything else will go towards the setting up of a celebratory thirtieth anniversary tour. <p /> If we fail to reach our target, everybody gets their money back and we’ll go back to playing cribbage and dribbling into our beer as we struggle to recall our exact whereabouts. But let’s not think about that, eh? <p /> Please give generously.",

Here again, this compilation-tape came with a fanzine and was     also available as a limited package with the 'Uncle Arthur's     Pop Parlour' compilation-tape in addition. ;;Perfection As A Hipster;;https://pressplayandrecord.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/abigails-birthday-party-1987/;;2000-10-10 $$     1984, my friend Dave Seabright bought the ‘Marnie’ 7” and I bought the 12”. ‘Butch’ became my first musician ‘mate’. I don’t mean we used to hang out and drink together but for a while we corresponded regularly: letters and postcards, long phone calls and we’d swap tapes and suggest bands that each other should listen to.     <p />     When Dave Driscoll and I decided to put the ‘Abigail’s Birthday Party’ tape together, we approached a number of bands asking for contributions. There were a lot of no replies and a lot of 'nothing to spare' messages which put a huge dent in our confidence. Then we received a tape from Pat with about half a dozen songs to choose from! That’s how we ended up with ‘Olof Palme’, an exclusive at that time! ;;Tony Jenkins;;https://thenewfools.bandcamp.com/track/something-fishy-going-on;;2021-12-18",

Barker</a> </span> was checking master vinyl copies of classical recordings for glitches - they don't make jobs like that anymore. In his spare time he discovered innovative souls struggling to make music and welcomed them to his Glass Records label. The roll call included Teenage Fanclub, Spacemen 3, The Pastels and The Jazz Butcher.     <p />     The 'Butcher' delivered a gaggle of albums and many 45s for Glass from 1983 to 1986, the jacket notes on the dusty tome that recalls this period mentions Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased), Thatcher, DIY post-punk, LSD, surrealist cabaret, The Velvet Underground, a bottle of Cointreau or two, the Amstrad 7090 and Ronco's 'Black Magic' compilation. All that led to the 'The Wasted Years': Four albums, many visions...     <p />     '<span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/bath.html'>Bath Of Bacon</a></b></span>' was an experiment in sound, conjoining that Ronco platter to Todd Rundgren, a guitar from Wes Montgomery's cupboard and mentions of imaginary monsters set to some funky chops. 'The sound of a few mates failing to take note that they've an LP to make!' claims the JB site. It's pop meets bluesy scat with plenty of deadpan irony - a theme that will recur.     <p />     '<span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/scandal.html'>A Scandal In Bohemia</a></b></span>' took a 'competent little rock band' with a bassist who'd served time in Bauhaus into a world chorused by multi-track vocals and bathroom ambience. 'A top-shelf diamond of a record that is filled with excellent, memorable songs.' (All Music).     <p />     '<span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/sex.html'>Sex And Travel</a></b></span>' offered a broadening perspective. Competence and European travel beget a narrative akin to an impressionistic cold war spy movie, a 'mess of styles' that became coherent. 'A great album,' muses All Music before comparing JB mainman Pat Fish to Ray Davies circa 1969. It's an 'accidental' concept album prone to fleeting melancholy.     <p />     '<span class='release_title'><b><a href='/albums/distressed.html'>Distressed Gentlefolk</a></b></span>', ahead of the original band's demise through 'fatigue and liquor' was the Butcher's stab at making their 'greatest album ever'. 'A beautifully romantic record of soft rock ballads and jazzy torch songs,' enthused Trouser Press. There's a folky edge scratching away beside the inevitable romp through pop music's historical lineage.     <p />     Four albums, then. The '80s recast at an ironic party of malcontents. Indie pop as a soundtrack. Songs that shouldn't fit together - but do. 'Wasted Years'? Yeah, really.",

Now hopelessly out of print, the session gets new life as part of the Brave New Waves series from Artoffact Records. This release includes a never-heard bonus track, a download card with bonus interviews, and completely updated and revised artwork, partially modified from the original Spooky sleeve art.     <p />     Led by Oxford philosophy graduate Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher himself) and featuring a dazzling array of co-conspirators (including David Jay of Love And Rockets and Bauhaus fame), The Jazz Butcher is one of the longest running and most cult pop bands in Britain, having recorded some 15 albums since its founding in 1982. The band was one of the gems on the Creation Records roster, and has recently seen an incredible reissue series on Fire Records.     <p />     The Jazz Butcher's Brave New Waves session was recorded on <a href='/gigs/1988/Jun5.html'>June 5th, 1988</a> in CBC Studio 13 in Montreal. The recording features cameos by both <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=performer&amp;q=Kevin+Komoda'>Kevin Komoda</a> (Rational Youth) and <a href='/gigs/search.html?f=performer&amp;q=Brent+Bambury'>Brent Bambury</a> (the Brave New Waves host).

		"notes": "Starting in the early 2000’s a friend of mine, Andy Clarke, started recording a Christmas Album each year to give away to friends and clients. They started as a bit of a joke based around his fictional alta ego “Uncle Andy” best described as a lecherous, fraudster, man of the cloth. Over the next few years more and more musicians became involved not just from The New Barcelona but from around the world, some still jokey but more and more they became serious production numbers. <p /> In 2007 the storyline for that years album was Uncle Andy’s huge charity gig, which at the end of he obviously stole all the takings. That year we finally asked Pat if he wanted to record one and he said he wouldn’t do a Christmas song, but he would record something … and oh did he do something special for us. He came round and recorded a beautiful version of Afterhours from the 3rd Velvet Underground album.;;Mark Cotton;;www.audiowrangler.co.uk;;2021-11-15 01:57:36",

The line-up was myself, Richard and Sumishta Brahm (13 Frightened Girls). <p /> Basically, I did the drum programming, bass and large electric guitars (note how I 'invented' Slowdive on Pedby's Grace), Richard did the mad ethnic instruments and a bit of bass and guitar, Sumishta sang, played the lap steel guitar and did a bit of electric 12-string. Any glockenspiels are probably down to me. <p /> Richard and I went on to try and rub the project up into a finished album with a big session at Woodhouse in November 92 (during which Richard also got into glockenspiel action, as I recall), but although we committed a further ten or so backing tracks (including the truly awesome 'My Milkfloat' featuring a casio playing 'My Desert' to itself under a barrage of early sixties electric milkfloat noises, which Richard insisted sounded just like Jimi Hendrix), we never finished them off. I still have the instrumental roughs at home. Richard and I often talked of finishing it all off, but neither of us likes the phone very much and it never got done. <p /> I have spotted bits and pieces from some of those aborted tracks showing up on Richard's Triumph 2000 LP. <p /> According to my cassette, we recorded five numbers",

Dodgers, who at the time had Darryl Strawberry on their team. Darryl had fled New York after cynical home fans had started chanting 'Oh Daaaaaryl...' at him when he was off form (most of the time, as it goes). <p /> Imagine our delight when the L.A. crowd started doing exactly the same thing! In addition, Darryl had recently become a follower of The Lord, a piety that did not seem to do anything very much for his game. Hence the 'put that Bible back!' line. <p /> The original version of 'Traffic' was credited to 'Cambodia', which was also the working name for Sumosonic throughout much of 1996. You can probably guess why we never ended up going public with that name.",
