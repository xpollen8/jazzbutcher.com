I happen to remember the Sunday afternoon I wrote it vividly. I was coming out of a good big meal washed down with wine at my parents' house. With nothing else to do, I returned home and started playing a chord suite used in Stairway to Heaven . For three or four hours, I worked on this damn thing, to conclude, at tea time, that it was really young music, useless and pretentious, and that it was better that I pass to something else. Released, I started to strum the A minor and the MI, in the very basic way of Patrick Fitzgerald, a punk songwriter, quite popular at the time. At that time, I was also listening to Charles Trenet and Jean Sablon a lot , and, for some reason, La mer came to me. Suddenly, I remembered all those crazy little songs we were taught at school, to make us learn French. Most of these songs were about elephants in one way or another. I started with this crazy literal translation of The sea comes in, the sea goes out . I stopped for a moment and laughed, “You can't do that!”, a usual thing in my writing process. And, in a few minutes, in a very strange way, the whole scene went by, in French in the text. After having struggled for hours, the sea was writing itself, in ten minutes. To be honest, I didn't think anyone, after that lonely Sunday afternoon, would ever hear this song, and certainly not in France! When we first performed there in 1986, the band asked me if we were going to play La Mer . “ Are you crazy? We're going to get killed! ” . This shows how wrong we can be.

The phrase came up some time in conversation\n\t\tand was duly seized upon. I think that it may well have been some\n\t\tkind of reference to Gerard Langley. We'd been to see the\n\t\tAeroplanes quite early on in their career on account of a review\n\t\tin the NME written by our pal Campbell Stevenson, which went under\n\t\tthe headline: \"Exploding! Plastic! In Bristol???\"\n\t\tBut, you know, Mark E. Smith is so steroptypically northern that\n\t\tthe very phrase \"southern Mark Smith\" comes across to me like \"lush\n\t\tSahara\"or \"wise and noble Bush\". So there's that too.\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tThe tune got \"written\" into a tape recorder during the BBC evening\n\t\tnews broadcast on Easter Sunday 1983.  References to Lady Di had\n\t\talready been excised by the time we recorded the single version, which was at\n\t\tthe beginning of September 1983. Ah well.\"\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tGood. There's that one wrapped up in a tidy little package. Now\n\t\tif someone cares to explain \"I Need Meat\"...\n\t\t<p />\n\t\t<b>A little later...</b>\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tI saw a bit of correspondence on the site about this \"Southern Mark Smith\" business. Our dear friend\n\t\tMister Berman appears to have had a fair stab at explaining what may or may not have been on my mind\n\t\tat the time (it is, frankly, not much use asking me at this advanced stage of the game...), but then\n\t\tanother fellow (Hank, is it?) steps in with some rather more speculative stuff about one \"McGinty\".\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tOur pal is referring to \"Pat, Trip Dispenser\", which was the b-side to the Fall's single \"C.R.E.E.P.\"\n\t\tTowards the end of the tune, things go quiet and Mister Smith is heard intoning (and I write from\n\t\tmemory) \"McGinty thought he could fool the Fall with his imitation speed!\" (My memory is about 100%\n\t\ton this one, though.)\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tNow, \"C.R.E.E.P.\" came out not long after we had recorded \"Southern Mark Smith\". Somebody at JBC\n\t\tCentral (Mitch?) brought home a copy. We heard the b-side and were struck down with fear, for we\n\t\tourselves were not sure whether somebody was having a pop at our gang (with Lolo Mcginty) or not. The\n\t\tman on the website clearly felt the same way, for he writes authoratitively for anyone who is paying\n\t\tattention that the McGinty hereinabove referred to was indeed the talented wee monkey boy who played\n\t\tbass for us.\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tYou can see what is going on here - there is a \"Pat\" in the title, a \"McGinty\" in the lyric and it\n\t\tcame out about the same time as our \"Smith\" record. You can see the way that Hank's mind is working\n\t\there, can't you, Mister Holmes?\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tTrouble is...it's not right. \"Pat, Trip Dispenser\" was already in the can before the Fall even heard\n\t\tour record. It is therefore definitely NOT an \"answer record\" to \"Southern Mark Smith\". And, as ever,\n\t\tthe clue is in the title. Those who know the history of the Fall well will tell you that the song is\n\t\tin fact a blast at infamous Manchester dealer, Pat McGinty. (Oh yeah - Pat, Trip Dispenser!) There\n\t\thad been a bit of customer dissatisfaction on the band's part, and this was their way of getting back\n\t\tat the naughty pharmacist (no, don't start...)\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tSo there you have it. Not the JBC, but some dodgy Mancunian c***.\n\t\tHope that clears things up.\n\t\t;;Pat Fish email;;;;2003-02-24 08:45:31","others_say":"","credits":"","tablature":"","tablature_credit":"","annotated":"","is_instrumental":"","images":"","video":"","dtcreated":"2024-10-12T02:53:24.000Z"},{"lyrics_id":158,"project":"sumosonic","href":"sumosonic_sputnik.html","title":"Sputnik","lyrics":"The satellites that circle us are witness to God's grace:\n\t<br />He could pluck them from their orbits, cast them into Outer Space,\n\t<br />But he lets them keep revolving as the Earth moves round the Sun,\n\t<br />The only truly brilliant thing we've ever done.\n\t<p />\n\tPhotographs of his creation - all the seas and land,\n\t<br />Beamed to us from our space station help us understand.\n\t<br />And the ladies in Los Angeles and the gentlemen in Perth\n\t<br />See them up there, circling the Earth.\n\t<p />\n\tFrom Siberia to the Sun\n\t<br />More than 90 million miles.\n\t<br />Take the People's Train to the Academy of Science.\n\t<br />Use the People's instruments, do the People's work:\n\t<br />Put it up there, circling the Earth.\n\t<p />\n\tWe all know the space heroes like Yuri Gargarin,\n\t<br />But unknown thousands gave their lives to bring us this machine.\n\t<br />Now everybody can see what their sacrifice was worth,\n\t<br />Coz it's up there, and it's circling the Earth.\n\t<p />\n\tThe satellites that circle us shine brightly as Big Stars,\n\t<br />They can see the Memphis soul men driving in their Big Black Cars,\n\t<br />And if you call them on the phone you might just hear the sound\n\t<br />Of the satellites as they go round and round.\n\t<p />\n\tHear your voice repeating when you're talking on the phone,\n\t<br />Know that they are up there, know that we are not alone.\n\t<br />And one day we'll all know what this life of ours is worth\n\t<br />Coz they're up there, circling the Earth.\n\t<p />\n\tCircling the Earth (x3)\n\t<br />For ever\n\t<br />For ever\n\t<br />Circling the Earth\n\t<br />Encircling the Earth\n\t<br />For ever.","mp3":"https://sumosonic.com/audio/sputnik.mp3","mp4":"","embed_link":"/video/sumosonic/sumosonic_sputnik","caption":"Demo Version","found_on":"thisissumo","pat_says":"","others_say":"","credits":"© <span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"https://patfish.com\">Pat Fish</a>\n\t</span>;;;;1996","tablature":"","tablature_credit":"","annotated":"","is_instrumental":"","images":"","video":"","dtcreated":"2024-10-12T02:54:16.000Z"},{"lyrics_id":145,"project":"","href":"still_and_all.html","title":"Still & All","lyrics":"I'm living in a film\n\t<br />Every day I leave the cameras rolling\n\t<br />And before I get the chance to light a cigarette\n\t<br />The lights come on - Action! - gimme tears\n\t<br />And if I were going to die\n\t<br />You'd be the girl I'd want to die for\n\t<br />Yeah I know that that's not right\n\t<br />But the hanging-on takes all the strength I have\n\t<p />\n\tDid you think you were doing me a favour girl\n\t<br />It's the strangest kind of failure girl\n\t<br />Hate the guide, drop the pilot, kill the messenger as well\n\t<p />\n\tSat outside the erzatz English bar\n\t<br />I knew enough to wish upon a star\n\t<br />I didn't figure on there being no stars where you are\n\t<br />Hadn't realized it had gone that far\n\t<br />And if I were going to die\n\t<br />I know the railway bridge I'd jump from\n\t<br />It's covered in lost causes anyway\n\t<br />I guess we'll never know who wrote them\n\t<p />\n\tDid you think you were doing me a favour girl\n\t<br />It's the strangest kind of failure girl\n\t<br />Hate the guide, drop the pilot, drown the orchestra as well\n\t<br />Did you think you were doing me a favour girl\n\t<br />It's the strangest kind of failure girl\n\t<br />Hate the guide, love the placement, the Replacements even?
