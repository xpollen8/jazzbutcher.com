			A quick report on last night's jazz butcher show for you....
			<p>
			I arrived in time for the last 15 minutes of max eider's set - he
			came on at 8.30, finshed just after 9. Finished with "It had to
			be you" and "Drink," looked cool in shades, backed by a girl
			singer and man in cardigan playing harmonica.
			<p>
			Middle band, Ubu Swirl, bass, cello acc & elc gtrs, drony &
			velvety, Ok for 10 minutes, kinda dull for 40.
			<p>
			Jazz Butcher Conspiracy were HOT to match the conditions.
			Pat & his bass player were dumb enough to wear 3-piece suits
			but managed to survive.I didn't recognise much of what they
			played (new stuff, I guess, plus one cover of a Strange Attractors
			song who Pat apparently place drums for, and one song by some
			guy that lives in the Alps).
			<p>
			Got called back for one encore, where Pat called Max up on stage
			(back from propping up the corner of the bar) where after a little
			on-stage cuddle he got to play guitar on a rocking "Zombie Love."
			Then it was curfew and we had to go home. The JBC hadn't played
			for a while, but that only showed in enthusiasm and not sloppiness.
			<p>
			Good fun, very hot.
			<p>
			Ciao,

			Mike Kelly and myself made it to the gig. We missed both the support,
			so no comment there. The band looked very smart - apparently because
			Pat has to dress up when he plays drums for the Strange Attractors!
			<p>
			Mostly new stuff from Illuminate. Opened with Rosemary Davis (one of
			my favourites). Played Cute Submarines, When Eno Sings amongst others
			- a pen would have come in handy.
			<p>
			Overall they were pretty hot - the best I have seem them, but they
			only played for an hour which was a bit disappointing. Crowd was
			biggish, enthausiastic and there was even dancing!
			<p>
			Later,

			Just to add a few details: Max Eider was *excellent* - I'd never seen him
			live before, and the songs from Distressed Gentlefolk and Best Kisser
			worked better, to my mind, in these reduced versions than they do on the
			albums.  Can't remember what he opened with, but shortly afterwards he
			jeopardised his indie cred by playing a Don Henley song.  He did a version
			("a song from Pat's 'cute' period") of Girls Who Keep Goldfish; also
			Raking up the Leaves, and Who Loves You Now.   The backing vocalist and
			harmonica player looked like they were having a lot of fun: jazz dancing
			behind Max's back.
			<p>
			Completely agree with Jonathan about Ubu Swirl - very Velvets, very
			Spacemen 3 - I was on the verge of shouting out for Transparent Radiation.
			<p>
			The JBC:  They were a little constrained by the size of the stage: they
			didn't rock out as they did at last summer's Borderline gig.  Pat looked
			good in his suit, but got lost behind his shades (a bad decision), and the
			whole gig felt slightly hurried (Blues For Dead Dean Reed at what seemed
			like double tempo) and slightly impersonal: he didn't talk between songs
			as much as at last year's Acoustic Conspiracy gigs, though there was a
			good story about Pete Astor, a capo, and an adventurous german woman.
			Dooj was more restrained than usual.
			<p>
			They opened with Rosemary Davis, the only song from Love Bus.  Of the new
			stuff they did: Cute Submarines, Scarlet, Ugliest Song in the World, When
			Eno Sings, Blues for Dead Dean Reed.  The song by the Austrian who lives
			in the mountains was Stereo Queen by ${wolfi}, which Pat has been
			doing in his solo gigs for a while: it's sounding better every time: he
			should record it sometime.

			Sitting as I am in an 'Internet Cafe', there's not a lot of time
			and I'm not really composed enough to offer a detailed description
			of events. However, I will say that it was a rocking show.
			<p>
			Set List: First off, Stranger Tractors. Loads of S/T songs, none of
			which I'd never heard before because I've never seen them play.
			Good band, actually. Pat looked cool on drums.
			<p>
			Then teeny tiny micro-mini set of Pat'n'Max. Three songs: Partytime,
			Drink (Max on vocals) and Girls who keep goldfish.
			<p>
			At this point, I crossed the thin line between sobriety and sheer
			intoxication [a line crossed some hours before by other members of the
			jbc-list by the looks of things] [and for which I owe Joe some beer if
			he ever wants to claim]. Fortunately, I managed to snarf the set list
			so I can tell you what they played: ODR [no idea], Mr Odd,
			Bakersfield, Our Friends the Filth, Old Snakey, Harlan, She's a yoyo,
			Scarlett, She's on Drugs, Sister Death.
			<p>
			Applause, disappearing band, more applause, reappearing band, encore:
			Take the skinheads bowling, Angels.
			<p>
			Angels was a stormer: everyone who has ever played guitar for the JBC
			on stage strumming away like they were going out of fashion (whoops,
			which they are).  so much so that they omitted the listed second
			encore: Caroline Wheeler.  Good job too, actually. No fitter ending
			than Angels, IMHO.
			<p>
			Pat has a copy of the show, which (when I get to send him a tape and
			some stamps) he'll duplicate on to me and David. Copies can no doubt
			filter out from these.
			<p>
			Took loads of photies. Enjoyed myself. Did not cry. Web site in memoriam
			when film is developed and I get somewhere other than this stinking caff
			to sit.
			<p>
