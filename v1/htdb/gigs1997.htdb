				Sound was initially v. poor, but improved after the first song (CF
				Spacemen).  Vocals/rap handled by unknown person - sounded slightly
				unsure.  Female backing vox v. good throughout.  Musicianship
				excellent comme d'habitude.  Audience inc. sad hippy bloke but also
				luminaries such as Tim from Homer and Wotjek from BA.
				<p>
				Not just Butcher legacy here but felt that his vocals had an authority
				that was noticeably absent otherwise.  Liked new bloke though - maybe
				better sound would have helped him.  Sound problems worst for guitar.
				Lighting really good, incidentally.
				<p>
				Venue fortified, previous band quite dodgy (Rush fans), nevertheless
				fun evening - good impression made.  Girlfriend disappointed by
				rendition of CFS, and worried by presence of unfashionable sad hippy
				bloke.  Steve (raver) loved it.  Christie (teacher) liked it.  I
				thought it was brilliant.  There you go.

		(verbatim from youtube) From Pat Fish:  This gig is from the 12 Bar Club in London's "Tin Pan Alley", Denmark Street in the West End on Thursday 11th September 1997. Max and I booked it as a warm-up for the trip to Seattle and San Francisco. It was the first time that we had played a set together in public since 1985. You can kind of tell; both players are on their best behaviour. ðŸ™‚

		I see no one's given any feedback on Thursday's 12 Bar Club gig. Well,
		what can I say ? Pat & Max were nothing short of excellent. Anyone
		going to S.F. is certainly in for a treat.

		I was there too: Pat and Max were great, not taking it too seriously at
		all ('Drink' was particularly silly), enjoying every moment of it. Max
		was in fine and distinctive voice, and as nimble fingered as ever. Apart
		from that, I don't want to give too much away, but I should think those
		of you lucky enough to be as the All American Music Hall (or whatever)
		will be treated to many cuts from the Bath of Bacon, and the Scandal in
		Bohemia (no Human Jungle, but I didn't notice its absence until I got
		home).
		<p />
		Robyn Hitchcock was later sighted skulking in the toilets, looking
		grizzled and misanthropic. I suspect the secret of Pat's eternal youth
		involves some sort of Picture of Dorian Grey arrangement. Anyway, enough
		of these ramblings: "enjoy", as I believe they say in America.

		Just got back from my European trip, which included the 12 Bar show, my
		first JB concert. Thouroughly enjoyed it. Bath of Bacon & Scandal in Bohemia
		predate my collection, so a good chunk of the material was new to me, but a
		lot of fun. Max has a kind of interesting expression when he plays, sort of
		an amused 'I knew that was going to happen' look. And I agree with the
		Dorian Grey comment previously posted.
		<p />
		Incredibly small room - I've never seen a set list taped to the front of the
		balcony before! We were close enough to the stage that when Pat introduced a
		song about 'small household pets' and I said to my non-JB familiar
		girlfriend, 'Domestic Animal', Pat looked up and said 'not that one'.
		<p />
		Snared Pat for a few seconds after the encore and gave him a couple of
		Fishirts I'd brought - T-shirts a friend of mine makes, one of a kind prints
		using real (not live) fish, which he graciously accepted.
		<p />
		I love seeing music in London. Also caught John Otway at the Weavers just
		before we left - hadn't seen him since '84, but he's as good as ever, and
		has really developed as a comedian - the talk side of his show is very good
		without being too polished. Believe my friend was actually much more taken
		with John than with the Butcher. Am now the proud owner of the Really Free
		20th anniversary of the hit t-shirt.
		<p />
		Looking forward to the news from the front after the S.F. show.

			beloved music behind and only resurfaced this year.  Can you imagine I
			missed the whole music scene of the last decade?  Everything after
			Distressed Gentlefolk was new to me...But I could still sing along to all
