    Here it is at last!  The hep young sound of todays beat
    élite, direct from the soul kitchen and served, still
    blazing, to your table!  The release of this, the Jazz
    Butchers first long play recording, comes after months of
    rumour and report of a hot new act with a cool new sound
    that leaves the others way way behind.  Now you too can hear
    for yourself the new groove that has set the bohemian set
    alight - in your own home!  Words alone cannot do justice to
    the cordon-bleu treats of the Butcher Beat - so roll back
    the carpet and swoop and dive with the fab Butcher Man!
    <p />
    <b>A Personal Message From The Jazz Butcher</b>:
    Well, it's sometime early in the big work ethic on a Friday
    morning and I'm hours away from the big bastard!  Looks like
    there's precious little time for me to chuck out that work
    ethic this weekend.  I've got to be a damned sight sterner
    than usual in the old quality control with the discipline
    that M.P.s pay high prices & favour for in those suburban
    bedrooms, if I'm to make it past the large sheet of paper
    with <b>NO MORE MONEY</b> writ large upon it.  Bus?  Train?
    - decisions, decisions!  Do we re-do the glockenspiels or
    echo the little so and soes out of all recognition - a sound
    you never heard before?  Which is The Voice to tell you
    about ${party}?  And will ${zombie} ever
    sound as good as The Zombies?  We're a long way from the
    truth yet poppets.  This is my first record all by myself.
    It's been a pleasure, which is good because that's what they
    should be isn't it?  It's been a worry to - still is - and
    loads more besides.... I'll let you know how we get on.

	The one nobody ever talks about, even though a surprising
    number of you seem to have it.  Recorded for just £300
    (Kevin Shields please take note...), it's really just the sound
    of a few mates failing to take seriously the fact they they've
    got an l.p. to make. ${gloop} and the unfinished ${engine} make me
    squirm a fair bit, but ${zombie}, ${gold}, and ${party} have all been
    good friends.
    <p />
    It seems VERY early eighties now, but you must remember that
    there was a LOT of crap for us to clear out of the way in those

    Concerns a number of conflicting feelings (yes, we do have them)
    about the strangest summer I ever spent.  Yes, it is a shame,

    The Albatross.  Since the recording of ${bacon} (almost
    two years before this one) we had become a "proper" group.
    For all that, we still pooled our skills in the studio,
    and this isn't a bad two weeks' work.
    <p />
    I think that, lyrically, a lot of the songs are a bit
    trite and immature, and our inability to take ourselves
    seriously is much in evidence.  A record, I feel, of
    its time.  We were young(ish) and cocky and I think it
    shows.  I still haven't learned to sing on this one,
    which bugs me too.  Still, it was cheap and cheerful,
    and it helped us to meet an awful lot of people.
    <p />
    I was told, incidentally, that if we released this on
    Glass we could expect a top global sale of 2,000.  We
    released it on Glass and sold about 25,000 copies.

    One day's rehearsal in Kevin Haskin's living room, five
    days' recording and two days' mixing was all it took
    for us to make my favourite of the Glass records.
    <p />
    Now that the band had done a few dates with decent p.a.
    systems and stuff, I was beginning to have some sort
    of a bead on this singing business.  Also, having exhausted
    the initial stick of JB songs (several of the ${scandal}
    tunes had actually been written at the time of ${bacon},
    but were rejected back then as needing further development),
    I was obliged for the first time to write about my life
    as it was at the time, which was very different to the
    way I lived when writing the first two records.
    <p />
    Now I was "in a band", had left my day job, had been
    to Europe... I even started to write songs that were
    not self-consciously deferential and mocking.  Hence,
    I guess, the arrival of the first recorded "big ballad"
    in ${rumour}, where David J.  harmonies at the end STILL
    give me the shivers.
    <p />
    I think that now we had started to learn about actually
    creating recordings rather than just recording the sound
    of a bunch of pals fooling around, and the disc does
    have a nice, unified feel. Credit ${rivers} for
    his high-speed mixing job.  When I think about it, this
    l.p.  doesn't really have any "great" tunes, in the sense
    of numbers that people request or whatever, but it has
    a nice totality, a good, atmospheric vibe.
    This one I'd actually defend at length if I had to.

    <p />
    I rather like having them all in one place like this
    - it makes for a nice, noisey muck-it-up sort of disc
    that is ideal for leisure time at home, on the beach,
    in you local club.... hell, ANYWHERE!!!  Let me tell you about it.
    <p />
     ${smiff} and ${count} were recorded in the summer
    of 1983 in a place called Wellingborough, a small town in the
    middle of England where even the children are scarey!
    "Hey, mister, can you SEE in them glasses?"  I get to
    sing and play things like guitar, sax and piano.
    Max does the electric guitar.  On bass is Rolo McGinty,
    and Princess Alice Thompson plays the organ.  They're both in
    the ${tops} now, a group internationally recognised as
    being the shortest collection of pop musicians in the
    world.  Playing the drums is Kevin Haskins, a charming
    neighbour of mine, and veteran of the ${haus} conspiracy.  Miaowula!
    <p />
     ${marn} and  ${zombie}
    were the hot spots from my second single,
    recorded in London one Sunday afternoon in January 1984.
    ${marn} is an attempt to force a meeting between the
    steaming tropical jungles of Bangladesh (where the tigers
    live) and the frozen stepps of Siberia (where the Siberian
    tigers live).  ${zombie} is just sick. Max and Rolo and
    me again, with Jody Palmer on drums, bongoes and "Oi'm jest
    a rual boy on a day out in London, guvnor".
    <p />
    ${road} features me, Max, David J.  on bass, and Mr Jones
    on drums, and was recorded in Wellingborough again in
    April '84.  The song is by ${richman}, but the sentiments
    are entirely our own. The "Twilight Zone Mix" on this
    record concerns Max's inability to get from one place
    to another without disappearing for long periods.  You've
    heard of the Bermuda Triangle?  Well, Max has shares
    in it.  <a id="rain"> ${rain}, recorded at the same session,
    concerns sex and the weather and the undoubted connection
    between the two.  Incidentally, it didn't rain once during
    the three days we were in the studio!
    <p />
     ${men} and ${jbpm} see the Jazz Butcher Group (me and
    Max and Dave and Jones) in vaguely political mood.  In
    other words, feisty.  Real Men, the kind who never sit
    together on buses in case they get their medallions tangled.
    The Prime Minister, a book-burning lunatic, under whose
    "leadership" the U.K. has become a police-state satellite
    of the most evil and morally corrupt regime in the world.
    Locked in the basement in Leamington Spa in steamy August
    '84, The Jazz Butcher Group reaches for the cheese wire!
    Gasp at the awesome sound of a guitar massacre in Parliament!
    <p />
    Lastly, from the same summer sessions, comes ${h2o} Max
    and I, late at night, contemplating the curious tale
    of the talking elephants, and the endless search for
   supplies of free drink...

    Damn good idea these retrospective re-releases; teach the
    bawling brats a thing or two about <b>real</b> music.
    Damn, <b>damn</b> good idea in fact.
    <p />
    The Jazz Butcher you say?  Yes, of course I remember them,
    and mostly fond memories they are too.  It was this very
    song with its analysis of Adam Faith as Marxist
    revolutionary that broke the mould and them internationally.
    Whilst I was roving (as any good reporter must) it was my
    good fortune to witness this band on the rise, and I learnt
    many things.
    <p />
    The Jazz Butcher boys were born when Elvis Presley joined
    the army; make of those two facts what you will.
    <p />
    After fraught and frugal years as an eager youth hatful of
    songs this very record, only three million times better than
    the third Frankie single (an old Queen cast off), signalled
    a change in peculiarities and the nation's desire to redeem
    its soild past.  The Jazz Butcher was on everybody's lips.
    Herpes spread like wildfire.
    <p />
    They met and charmed everyone, even in 'Hi' society where
    they would be forced to tell what Boy George was really like
    (yes he bathed every day and yes he washed his hands before
    meals) and why pop music no longer meant Doris Day.  Another
    cigar Gertrude?
    <p />
    They wore way out of gear but never fell in love with
    Russian spies.  They sang of fish (gills will be gills) and
    most importantly, kept Hazel O'Connor locked in a cellar ten
    feet down.
    <p />
    They were pop pirates in the greatest of British traditions.
	  'Hello there, nightowls, they would say but when the pop
    concert ended and the disco resumed life was found to be
    wanting.  The police kept telling the kids to move on.
    Trouble was brewing; some took umbrage, others 'pep' pills
    whilst some took simply outrageous liberties, controversy
    fuelling chart success.  Who can forget their third album,
    'Doctor Chumley Repents' and the questions asked in the
    house?  A battalion of TV screens were kicked in.  Things
    had to stop.
    <p />
    Finally they went too far, waving their winkles at Her
    Majesty's Government.  Immediately, and quite
    domocratically, their royalties were sequestered.
    <p />
    Never before in the field of human conflict has so much been
    owed by so many to so few.
    <p />
    The debts linger on, every bit as much as their mass suicide
    in Trafalgar Square.  <b>Real</b> men.
    <p />
    ${mercer}
    <p />
    Claudi Bidi writes "what a load of codswallop!  It was my
    great fortune to be intimately acquainted with the Jazz
    Butcher and I know for a fact that during those last
    desparate years he fell in love with Russian Spies all the
    time."

   A Sri Lankan gentleman once sat down beside me in a bar
    in Bremen, asked me to sign his copy of this record,
    and then, even as I wrote messages of good luck and global
    harmony, announced sternly "This is a very...bad record."
    He was a berk, but he had a point.  Alan McGee and a number
    of people in France, America and The Music Business have
    called this one a "classic album".  People do, of course,
    say much the same about "Dark Side Of The Moon".  Can
    you hear my flesh creeping?  Germans, on the other hand,
    despise it almost universally.
    <p />
    We were deeply confused young men when we made this record.
    Max, Jones and I had all been drinking dangerously for
    over a year now, and the poor bass player who replaced
    David was finding it almost impossible to keep up with
    our twisted thought patterns.  Do you like my bass playing?
    That's me on ${shame}, ${sa} and a couple of others.
    <p />
    By now, effectively, Max and I had totally lost any sense
    of quality control on my writing.  Tragic and sincere
    or glib and ludicrous, we recorded EVERYTHING.  Sent
    in to make demos for this l.p.  Max and I came out with
    ${conspir} where we squandered a couple of great ideas that
    this l.p. so badly needs.  ${rivers} you'll notice, has
    bought a new reverb unit, a Lexicon, in fact.  He's also
    taken to recording digitally.  The ensuing absurd gloss,
    matched with an absence of native intelligence around
    the bottom end, gives a lot of the songs a sound that
    I dislike.  ON THE OTHER HAND, there's ${angels}, ${fall}, ${world}.
    <p />
    Still, in 1986 the best plan would be to buy the
    <a href="angels.html">12" single</a> and go see the band
    in concert.  Generally, we had it down in concert.  In
    just about every other department, however, we were coming
    to bits, individually and collectively, and to me this
    record actually shows the morbid state of things at the
    time.  Not, of course, that we really noticed any of
    this until months later, when, confronted by the realitied
    of having been on an accidental two-year intercontinental
    binge, we retired damaged, leaving the group in pieces.
    Oh, and another thing about <b>Gentlefolk</b>... it's
    pretentious too.

	The Jazz Butcher and his group are not in the business of belonging; they are too old and too obstreperous to conform to some attention-seeking image or commercially viable formula. Rather, they bring their not inconsiderable talents to bear on whatever happens to be in the way at the time. The results can only be described as essential.
#define	albums[16]->liner
    The Jazz Butcher first appeared in Bohemian London in 1983,
    clutching a battered acoustic guitar called Lenin and
    looking for a place to stay.  His origins remain unclear to
    this day.  Some say that he swam to safety from the wreck of
    doomed Liberian supertanker Gonzolo; others that he had been
    planted by Speznaz to subject the English legal profession.
    The most credible theory is that he had formerly been hiding
    out in darkest rural Northamptonshire.. plotting.  What was
    in his mind is only too blatantly set forth within the
    grooves of this disc: A semi-literate pub-crawl through the
    swamp of rock's rich tapestry, laced with self-destructive
    recreational pursuits and maddened by the buzzing of a
    thousand punk rock guitars.
    Not that the sound of the Jazz Butcher and his Sikkorskis
    from hell (for it is they that are likely to relate to your
    scrambled transatlantic notions of what constitutes Le
    Pernk).  Press him on the subject and he will sputter
    through the special brew, "of course we're a punk group -
    because we do what we want to do" fair.  As they say,
    enough.  To me, though, the Butcher's axe grinds somewhere
    along the non-existent fusion between soul music and the
    sort of dirty pop that failed to make the ${vu}
    famous.  Not that this would take into
    account the skiffy suicide that constitutes ${reagan},
    or the bittersweet cushioning
    that cradels the decidedly neurotic ${sat}.
    And Max Eider's ${drink} (dedicated to his hobby) is
    another sack of potatoes altogether.  The Jazz Butcher and
    his group are not in the business of belonging; they are too
    old and too obstreperous to conform to some
    attention-seeking image or commercially viable formula.
    Rather, they bring their not inconsiderable talents to bear
    on whatever happens to be in the way at the time.  The
    results can only be described as essential.

    This sold rather well, which was pleasing, and seems

    Howdy!! Welcome to the J.B.C release.  Thanks for the money.
    We'll be spending it on weapons and drugs.  The first thing
    that you have to understand about this disc is that it is
    <b>not</b> an L.P.: it is a single and a radio session
    nailed together for your amusement.
    <p />
    The single is on side A and was recorded in May 1988 at "The
    Greenhouse" in London.  It was recorded by ${iain} and
    features Mulreany on drums, O'keefe on bass, Kizzy on
    guitar, Alex on sax, and me on the rest.  Except for ${best}
    which features Bhang & Olafssen on bass & drums
    respectively.  Confused? You ain't heard nothing yet. (Black
    betty, bam-ba-lam-ooh-babee a-wop-ba-ba-loo bop-sha-la-la
    na-na-na-na early-in-the-morning whoa-dubious-lou-etc.)
    <p />
    The radio interference may be found on side b, and was
    manufactured on 5th June/Juin '88.  It was engineered by
    Richard and Yves, and produced by the very wonderful Kevin
    Komoda with me breathing hotly down his very patient neck.
    Mulreany, O'Keefe, Kizzy and I play and sing with a cameo
    appearance from Kevin on organ on ${go}.
    <p />
    I hope you dig the noises on this record.  That is, after
    all, the reason for our making them.
    <p />    <a id="spooky">
        In March & April of '88 the Fishpower J.B.C. was on tour in
        europe.  One of the great attractions of Eurotrucking is the
        hour-or-so of dancing to be had between packing up the
        noise-boxes after the show and driving back to the hotel to
        get profoundly twisted.  This year, however, we found a
        severe shortage of suitable frugging material and so, on our
        return to the green unpleasant land, we set about recording
        our own "Dance Record."  The result is this, you own J.B.C
        "Acid Shed" version of Classix Four's ${spooky}.  The
        idea is that you turn it up very loud indeed and thrash
        about in a carefree fashion until it stops.  Check it, as
        they say, out.
    </a>
        <p />
    <a id="best">
        In a similar vein comes the Edgar Wallace mix of ${best},
        a rap which originally appeared on the indisposible
        ${fishco} L.P.
        This version, specifically aimed at Italian discotheques,
        was set down through a haze of paracetemol, codeine & Red
        Stripe Lager in defiance of the most apalling toothache
        known to mankind, May '88 model.  My thanks to the revolting
        O'Higgins for some serious mix magick.  Linguistic note:
        "Edgar Wallace" is surrealist rhyming slang for "serious."

	<div class="annotation">Early 1989 was, indeed a strange and desperate time after all that triumphalist Tory looting that had been going on. We listened to a lot of hip-hop and soul music at the time, and I think that we considered ourselves sufficiently HARD to take the whole fucker on in an l.p. Possibly with a more "clued-in" producer and a bit more self-discipline we could have come up with something like what we were looking for.</div>

    This was a real "band" album by a touring unit which
    had become really quite ferocious.  In choosing to work
    with ${rivers} again we felt that we were sufficiently
    noisy and fierce to cope with any over- tidy production
    strokes he might pull.  "Clean *that* up, then, ya bastard"
    was out declared policy in the group.
    <p />
    Of course, we under-rated him.I wanted to start to mess
    with the pretty traditional song structures we were using.
    We were all aware that music was changing, and, more
    out of interest than out of any spurious "career" concern,
    we wanted to see where we could take our pop songs using
    things like breakdowns, the mixing in of "found" voices
    (which we first heard NOT from Steinski or the Bryne/${eno}
    collaboration, but from John Stapleton, a DJ who scratched
	  things in at early ${aero}, radical and unexpected changes
    of sounds - a series of sonic events rather than plain
    old verse/chorus structure.  I probably did too much
    pre-production on my (new) 4-track at home, and the whole
    thing sounds a bit stillborn.

    "<b>Basement</b>"; the word
    smacks of oily concrete parking lots, hotel elevators and
    bulky, bovine [spongiform] laundry baskets.  The
    Basement; as far down as we go.
    <p />
    It oughtn't, by rights, to have had a garden.  Oh, the
    initial impression was just right!  Seedy London
    frontage; scrawled cardboard messages by the bell; a
    dark, intricate descent through too many doors, perfect
    underground T.V. squalor, beyond the mysteries of Edgar
    Wallace late at night in black and white and what's that
    sudden pain in the small of my back?
    <p />
    Once through that final door, things would take an
    unexpected turn.  I'm entering the chamber now.  Whoa!
    The jackal-headed dead!  Excellent!  Music and dancing
    and improbable combinations of Czech beer and
    Jalapeños!  Doors flung open to an ivied yard where
    the randomly seditious lounge on cushions and hoot at the
    stars and that singular man next door.  Sometimes friends
    of friends would come by and take it for a nightclub.
    But it wasn't a nightclub, it was a basement.
    <p />
    The big red bedford mobile nation state rolls on, and,
    rolling, cannot stop.  Miles in darkness to the appointed
    spot, deep wold evil dead killers wind shelter: beans,
    bitburger and no such thing as noise reduction.  Mules in
    the night, mantor and eggulos tremble at the head of the
    board, waiting for the great infector to make with the
    knife.  Stray Americans, stray steg, nice.
    <p />
    Dank!  teeth and hair fall out.  Fingernails keep
    growing.  The pump is out, the night is dark, we're
	waiting for Mary.  Don't go out to the beer shack.  Those
    jackal-headed dead could be on the lurk.  Voluptuously of
    course, it looked like a farmhouse.  But it wasn't a
    farmhouse, it was a basement.

    Well, if things seemed weird back in February 1989, by
    January 1990, when we made this baby, the Weird were
    going shopping on bikes.  With Kizzy sick and unable
    to tour, ${richard} had joined and, during a long
    US/Canadian tour has turned us all on to Can and a lot
    of other weird things.
    <p />
    In a farmhouse in the dead of winter, in personal circumstances
    too bizarre and complex to relate, we set about making
    our "commercial suicide" album.  When we delivered it
    to ${creat} they did their nuts and said it was the best
    thing we'd done in years. It took me a while to figure
    it out, but then I agreed with them.
    <p />
    For the first time, I felt, we had made an album that
    really sounded like us.  In retrospect, one or two of
    the tunes are a touch throwaway, and EVERYBODY hates
    poor ol' ${bait}, but you get ${go}, ${drugs} AND ${sis} AND
    ${odd} all on one record! Goodness!  This record does have
    personality.  It also has ${lix} on guitar, the start of another
    beautiful friendship. One of my favourites, this.

    Four desperate men, all too desperate to notice how desperate

    the pain and crap from which this record was made, the
    actual sessions were a gigantic and wonderful party.
    <p />
    The songs are all long because we (Paul, Joe, Lix & I)
    just enjoyed the playing on the "to-be-faded" bits so
    much that it seemed a shame not to let everyone hear
    them.  This was warmly received by The Outside World,
    less popular among those who counted themselves JBC afficionados.
    Well, I couldn't have written it any other way, and I
    love that everyone plays on it, so I'm not in much of
    a position to know why you don't care for it. All I can
    say is that I'm still well pleased with it as a recording,
    and as a piece of writing about a tough subject. I mean,
    <b>I</b> hate "divorce rock" too.  It wuz a tough assignment.
    <p />
    Go on, give the fucker another listen.  The songs may
    not make you laugh, but the playing ought to give you
    a few thrills. And, after all, I'm not in a band to make
    money, or be a "professional entertainer" - I'm in a band
    because I like to play very loud electric guitar.  This
    IS the sound of me having fun, and getting me to do that

The Black Eg was born.
#define	albums[33]->liner
    Karel Von Dämmerung, writer, adventurer and self-proclaimed
    beacon of the bohemian gonzo faction, has long been a legend in
    the seedier cafes of central Europe.  For many years
    his extraordinary fanzine <b>Sinful Beat</b> provided
    a lifeline to those in Czechoslovakia and Hungary who
    wanted to keep abreast of international music developments,
    while his own reckless encounters with authority provided
    both hilarity and inspiration to the inhabitants of grimly
    over-protective regimes.  Unlikely tales of his personal
    crusade on the frontiers of modern pharmacology are legion,
    and there was a time when he said to be known by sight
    to some two thirds of all the members of the Czechoslovakian
    secret police.
    <p />
    Karel left his native land and settled in Vienna in 1985
    after being refused re-entry at Prague airport by the
    authorities.  The word is that, returning from some partially
    legitimate 'Cultural Exchange' trip to Cuba, he caused
    havoc at the Customs desk by presenting the official
    with a large bag of high grade ganja and announcing his
    intention to import two live Pygmy Crocodiles.  Somehow
    he succeeded in obtaining Political Refugee status in
    Austria, where for the first time he was able openly
    to publish his deranged writings.
    <p />
    Early in 1989 two events occured which led to the formation
    of the combo whose first waxings you are now holding.
    First, Karel's two brothers, Otto and Emil, arrived in
    Vienna, having taken advantage of the new freedoms introduced
    by the enlightened government of Vaclav Havel. Second,
    Karel obtained in a second hand store and ancient sequential
    circuits drum machine and a primitive sampler.  ${eg} was born.
    <p />
    After travelling to Italy for the World Cup, where they
    did their best to establishthe hitherto concept of Czech
    hooliganism, the brothers Von Dämmerung travelled
    across Europe, arriving in England at the end of July.
    Whilst there, they circulated copies of a cassette they
    had made. The general reaction was one of disbelief.
    Many people were heard to make rather unkind remarks
    about people who took too many drugs.
    <p />
    The record which you now have in your hands has been
    mastered from that cassette.  Recorded on four-track
    equipment in bedrooms across central Europe, it makes
    no claim towards sonic sophistication.  Indeed it makes
    no real claims of any kind whatsoever.  The Brothers
    Von Dämmerung are only too proud to retell the story
    of how, at their first and only public appearance, at
    a bar in Vienna, the proceedings closed in utter confusion
    after members of the public, objecting to The Black Eg's
    relentlessly tedious version of Morricone's theme to
    <i>The Good, The Bad & The Ugly</i> caused a near riot
    when they attacked the band with C.S. gas.
    <p />
    Nor are the "band" remotely apologetic for their spectacularly
    odd choice of samples.  It is tempting to speculate that
    all the loops on this record derive from free review
    copies sent to <b>Sinful Beat</b> in the hope of publicity.
    Certainly one can detect the presence of the ansaphone machine
    on many tracks.
    <p />
    Since ${creat} acquired the tapes for this album they
    have been unable to locate Karel Von Dämmerung or
    either of his brothers.  There is a rumour that they
    are currently in Los Angeles engaged on some form of
    private espionage.  Other sources have them in Vietnam,
    looking to collaborate with local musicians on a curious
    hybrid of the native folk music and the American Twist
    craze which blossomed in the mid-sixties.  Their names
    have been linked with that of California's ${braind}
    and east coast legend Meathook Wiliams
    (Stepfather of the Blues).  It is quite possible that
    no more will ever be heard from there shadowy degenerates.
    Meanwhile ${creat} is proud to offer this brief and fascinating
    glimpse into the world of three foolish central Europeans
    who thought they were making dance music.

        Not, obviously enough, about the dear lady herself,
        more about a miserable rainy night in Camden and the
        extraordinary things that some people read these
        days.  Remember, when somebody writes a "self-help"
        book that's exactly what they are doing: helping
        themselves.  Flipper says "hi", by the way.

        If you let me out on my own in that condition, what
        do you think is going to happen?  Butcher and
        Twilight Zone collide on the streets of Hollywood,
        resulting in ongoing art-misery attack and some
        deeply aquamarine guitar from that nice

        Uh... in the Sixties Beirut was a real playground
        for the rich, like Cannes or Ibiza or something.  A
        nice place to visit.  Sometimes things really do
        just slide right out of control, don't they?
        Lexicographical note: to anyone who finds the
        juxtaposition of the words "Beirut" and "filth" a
        tad obvious, I would just say that "filth" is an
        agreeable little lowlife term that one uses in
        London to describe our wonderful police force.  I
        trust that clears things up a little.

        ${smiff} (Big Return)
        Well, the JBC really did get a big return off this
        one.  It opened a lot of doors for us in Europe and
        America, and listening back now I think I can see
        why.  No, I mean that <i>Hammond</i>...

    <a id="jungle">
        ${jungle}
        The title comes from a rather noir little TV series

        from the early Sixties wherein the great Herbert Lom
        played the extremely sexy and not entirely
        unbrilliant Dr. Alexander Kordu, a psychiatrist with
        the handy ability to sort out even the most
        appalling cases within sixty minutes. I love that
        show, but I love touring better.  By the way, anyone
        who makes suggestions about sex and travel is being
        extremely rude.

        ${perfect}, featuring a superlative
        example of the ${richard} guitar assult.  The lead vocal was
        recorded in the studio garden at one in the morning
        in mid-January.  The reasoning escapes me now.
        Probably, I had been very bad.

    <a id="best">
        ${best} (Edgar Wallace Mix)
        "Edgar Wallace" means "serious" in surrealist
        rhyming slang, which is a good way to describe the
        toothache I had when O'Higgins and I did this mix.
        Odd barnyard noises may be blamed on the
        aforementioned ${perfect}, who got in there somewhere.

        We were halfway across the rockies in supernatural
        British Columbia when I realised that I had never
        come across a song with this title before.
        Obviously something had to be done.  Dave Francolini
        (a wonderful man who should not be allowed to drive)
        contributed some of the most hyperactive handclaps
        that I have ever experienced.  Then we tied him up
        and put him with the others.

        one.  Except for the middle instrumental, which
        always makes me think of people hang-gliding in the

        that I once saw on TV.

        The desk clerk couldn't believe it.  This drunk
        comes staggering into the lobby in the middle of a
        thunderstorm and starts wittering in bad German.  To
        keep him from dripping all over the place the clerk
        hands him a room key.  "Excellent!" burbles the
        drunk, "Room 109!"  The scarey stuff kicked in the
        bathroom.  You know, I once spent an evening
        indulging heart attacks in a Vancouver hotel room by

        ${party} (Original)
        I guess you could say that this was the first jazz
        butcher song ever written.  This recording is almost
        ten years old now.  I find it staggering, but there
        are hundreds of people out there (I've seen them) on
        whom the irony has yet to take effect.  Perhaps it
        would help them to know that the events described in
        this song ended up with the writer in hospital.  We
        all like a laugh, though, don't we?

        This is still one of my favourites.  I wrote it in
        1986 (the day they bombed Tripoli, in fact) about
        things that would only come to pass three years
        later.  Or something.  Oh God, I never make any
        sense when I start to talk about this tune.  The
        lyrics just showed up, like automatic writing or

	At a time when there would appear to be no need for it, here they come again. That Purveyor of some of the most heavenly and enduring pop non-hits you're ever likely to hear has regrouped his gang of aging sociopaths and built himself, in the barns and sheds of Northamptonshire, a band.

	<b>Cars Of Destiny</b> - <i>The view from Abington Square</i>
    <p />
    Built on a swamp, the natives will tell you.
    <br />"The Nene Delta" I've heard it called; or "Murder Mecca
    of the Midlands"; or "${chick}."
    <br />Anyone who's ever really thought about the place feels
    it deep inside; somewhere in Northampton lies the Heart Of
    Darkness.
    <p />
    Abington Square is more of a triangle, a wide and windy
    expanse where, amid a welter of traffic islands, the
    Kettering and Wellingborough roads converge.  Marooned on
    one such islet stands the atheist M.P. Bradlaugh, still
    wagging an admonitory finger at those who would buy their
    convictions in bulk.  He was refused his seat in Parliament
    because he was not prepared to swear an oath on the Holy
    Bible.  Notwithstanding which, the people of Northampton
    persisted in electing him over and over again.  Eventually
    there was a riot in town, and the Army had to be sent for.
    Recently a sad priest, who had clearly lost his flock to the
    church of medicine and found the time weighing heavy on his
    hands, suggested that the statue of Bradlaugh was a godless
    example to the citizenry and should be pulled down.
    <br />
    On high days and holidays members of the Jesus Army sect
    parade around town in paramilitary garb; some of them could
    knock poor Bradlaugh down with their breath.
    <p />
    Perhaps they might pause to look for their special kind of
    convert in the War Memorial that looms behind Bradlaugh on
    the largets of the chain of islands.  Standing long and low
    on its concrete football feet, it is inhabited largely by
    advanced cider technologists and those with a nostalgia for
    the golden days of glue.  Cars, lorries and buses wheel
    around between the islands in a bewildering fashion; it is
    possible that some of the denizens of the War Memorial have
    been trapped there for some time.
    <p />
    Across two busy lanes of traffic, at the north-west corner
    of the square, stands a bright new building.  It has huge
    glass windows, for it is a motor car showroom.  All the cars
    in the show room will cost you more than a house round these
    parts.  The staff inside, as visible to passers-by as the
    vehicles on display, are well turned out young people, and,
    in an incongruous effort to bestow a human touch upon their
    workplace, they have installed there a large toy leopard.
    Or jaguar.  Cars of destiny - the JBC salutes you.
    <p />
    The November light begins to dim.  Soon it will be time to
    spill out of the Racehorse and thrill to the display of
    festive lights on the jeweller's shop.  But in an alley
    around the back, there is work to be done.  A small man with
    a bald head is standing in the remains of the afternoon sun,
    holding a ferocious looking whip, the handle of which
    appears to be the forelimb of some kind of deer.  He is
    surrounded by microphones and a knot of inquisitive small
    girls.  A taller man with long hair calls to him from the
    roof above: "You are making... a film, ja?"
    <p />
    For something strange is happening at The Lodge.  An unruly
    association of aging sociopaths is gathering here to commit
    their feelings to magnetic tape.  Here, as close to the very
	Heart Of Darkness as analogue equipment will permit, the JBC
    squander Kremlin gold on honeyed dum-dum shells and doomed
    archaeological relics through which to filter their erudite
    and sickened communiques to the world beyond their most
    diseased imaginings.
    <p />
    And you uncannily, and holding now the results of those
    strange days on Abington Square.  Beasts and super-beasts,
    phantom truck rides through East and West, the living and
    the (jackal-headed) dead, faith and delusion, The Fear Thing
    and a whole new theory of earthly evolution.  With glass
    doors.
    <p />
    Real stories with real airbrakes - captured on an intrepid
    expedition which took Herr Doktor and his trusty tape
    machine deep into the very bowels of the cavernous bus
    station early one Sunday morning.  (the time at which most
    people disappear.)
    <p />
    Come trawl the zeitgeist with the JBC, where it's
    one-man-one-stick, and a bed of rice really is a bed of rice.
    Listen, if you will, to these stories from Abington Square.

    New JBC lp duly completed in secure Northampton location.
    1994 live line-up stumbled through a series of tunes and such under
    Butcher's direction, aided and abetted by a number of the usual
    suspects; ${lix} on guitar, ${green} on saxes, that sort of thing.
    Max Read was engineer for the session, and he also
    contributed a lot of the backing vocals. He is a good looking chap,
    non-smoker, very able and agreable. Judge Curtis was on hand to play
    the Hungarian Stock Whip.
    <p />
    <i>"Where did you get that?"
    <br />"I got it from Jane."
    <br />"Jane who?"
    <br />"Jane the Pain, who do you think?"</i>
    <p />
    A chap from Stranger Tractors called Bolly played dijeridoo on one
    number. Writer currently unable to establish JBC motives behind this.
    Musical Dave, of Northampton combo Ubu Swirl (Do they know that the
    JBC call them "Hobo Swill"?), contributed a spiffy guitar, and there
    were further vocal contributions by friends and family. The WOLFS,
    I am assured, are not a sample. The Butcher mixed one or two of the
    shorter tracks, but the vast majority of the mixing was handled -
    in his own inimitable style - by producer ${dj}.
    David gave the impression that he was having a whale of a time.
    <p />
    The JBC themselves are agreed that "Man 0f The Match" on this record
    has to be ${dooj}. Apart from dismissing his bass parts in about 36
    minutes, he also contributed guitar and some astonishing backing
    singing....and he plays the SYNTHESISER! Moves instituted by the
    drummer to entitle the album "DOOJ IS COOL" were, however, swiftly
    and brutally suppressed by the ruling junta.

    The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy's new long player has been titled,
    mastered, cut, approved, decorated, roached and smoked. After lengthy
    (like, stupidly lengthy) deliberations, the title finally settled
    upon is "Illuminate" (which is to be pronounced, in order of
    preference, i) as an adjective, like "illiterate", ii) as the Italian
    feminine plural of "Illuminati" or, iii) if you simply must, the
    obvious way) (see how useful advance information can be.. imagine how
    you will be able to laugh at your poorly-advised friends when they
    call the record Illumin8 like the bourgeois proles you most certainly
    aren't). The discussion was diverted from its original course with
    the arrival of Jean-Pierre Loonie's artwork, which features (as
    alluded to in "${cute}") candles-a-gogo, and a religious
    lunatic from, we are assured, Idaho with rather less sartorial
    wherewithal than might be considered...erm... decent. It was this
    latter factor which swayed from our original "final" choice of
    "Beasts and Superbeasts" for, perhaps a little rarely for the JBC,
    taste had to prevail. The mastered version sounds markedly better
    than the original mix, a fact for which we are all grateful, and we
    now have some hopes for people actually liking this waxing (as Fishy
    said to me on the telephone only the other day, it's right up the
    Jazz Butcher fan's STUPID street).

	<b>From The Sports Desk</b>
	<hr />
	Those who saw the Jazz Butcher's earliest performances
	might well be forgiven for entertaining the notion that
	here were farcial drunks with no drummer, best euphemised
	as 'eccentric' and kept at a distance.  As the highly
	excitable Butcher and dapper, unflappable guitarist
	${max} careered from one ill-advised engagement to the
	next with a constantly changing band of friends, they
	delivered a series of wildly erratic shows driven by
	blind faith and the systematic abuse of cheap liquor. It
	was hard to tell if these people were for real.  They
	would roll up in an open-top Triumph Vitesse with bits of
	drum kit sticking out the back.  Sometimes the Butcher
	would ride the tube to shows, wearing his sailor hat and
	carrying his guitar in a cardboard box with a huge
	drawing of E.T. on it.  Of course, it was the only way
	they knew how.
	<p />
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Jan27.html">In January 1984</a>,
	Max & The Butcher were engaged to appear at a London
	Polytechnic.  The ensuing debacle, fuelled by Carlsburg
	Special Brew, saw them both walk offstage at different
	times, and climaxed with their shadowy friend, The
	Antchrist, shouting pointlessly from a step ladder.  Word
	is that they found Mister Jones, the drummer, the
	following day.  Soon after, ${sm} joined in to play bass
	and a band existed.
	<p />
	Glass Records supremo David E. Barker had built up some
	curiosity around the Butcher's deceptively professional
	early singles, and the group now found themselves playing
	to people who wanted to see them.  Some were disaffected
	goths, many were Japanese, one of them was ${dj},
	architect of <i>Bela Lugosi's Dead</i> and eagle-eyed pop
	detective.  Divid had been watching this nonsense for
	some time, and soon befriended all the musicians.  With a
	few dozen beers David signed up 'on loan' to play the
	bass, and made <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Apr21.html">his
	debut with the band</a> at Alan McGee's <b>Living Room</b>
	club in a tiny bar in North London.
	<p />
	That was the start of a busy year, from which many of the
	recordings on this collection come.  David and producer
	${rivers} taught the band a host of tricks, resulting in
	the first really professional Jazz Butcher L.P.,
	${scandal}.  The band also developed an agent and a van.
	David told the group about The Rider, and they saw that
	it was good.  In December the group climbed under a duvet
	on the floor of a Ford Transit and headed for their first
	European Dates.  They played two <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Dec8.html">magical</a>
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Dec9.html">nights</a> in
	Hamburg that shaped the lives of many involved.  They
	drank gluehwein in a lakeside cafe on a Sunday afternoon.
	The Butcher, whose first reaction to being in Germany had
	been to hide under a table, had some kind of small
	epiphany.  They blew all the money in Amsterdam on the
	way home.
	<p />
	Over seven extremely wintry days in January 1985 the band
	completed another L.P.  ${mercer} (who pointed out that
	these boys were born the year that Elvis joined the army)
	had once prophesied that the Butcher's 3rd L.P. would be
	called 'Doctor Cholmondley Repents'.  But they were
	young, they were headstrong, they called it ${sex}.  It
	is the sound of a band at the peak of its creativity, and
	anyone who saw the group on the ensuing British dates
	would have a very different opinion to one who had
	watched the Butcher plummet from the stage of
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1983/Nov23.html">the Embassy
	back in 1983</a>.
	<p />
	Spring 1985 was time for David to go.  The man called
	${felix} arrived with his big Italian acoustic bass, and
	the endless touring began.  Between March
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/index.html">1985</a> and December
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/index.html">1986</a> the
	Jazz Butcher group played over 200 shows in 12 countries.
	They took to the life of the amplified itinerant with
	gusto, even surviving an early setback when the bus
	seized up in rural Sweden, forcing them to travel in a
	group with as much equipment as they could carry by train
	to the next date... <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/Mar31.html">in Zurich</a>.  They
	survived, but only just.  And Felix no longer believes
	that Switzerland is next door to Sweden.
	<p />
	The band took to Europe and vice-versa.  There were
	festivals in tents with people waving flags, lost
	weekends in Vienna, mad nights in dimly remembered
	nightclubs, and vodka everywhere.  There was chocolate
	cake all over Room 27.  '<i>In Europe</i>', beamed The
	Butcher, '<i>They treat you like a human being instead of
	a musician</i>'.
	<p />
	They still had their special nights.  A show in Sicily
	ended with the amplifiers on fire and the Butcher so
	drunk that he thought he'd got religion.  There was a
	first, brief foray into Spain that saw three of the group
	return physically wounded and drained of all bodily
	fluids.  As they leaned, croaking, on the Heathrow
	travolator, they were passed by a planeload of Japanese
	tourists, each one fresh as a daisy and keen to take a
	look at their first English person.
	<p />
	In the summer of 1986 the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, as
	they now called themselves, found themselves headlining
	at a <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Jul3.html">festival of
	Italian Communist Youth in Naples</a>.  After the show
	somebody asked the Butcher '<i>Where are you playing
	next?</i>' and he found himself having to reply
	'<i>New York City</i>'.  For Barker had been busy, and
	unbeknown to the group, <a
	href="${jbc_albums}/nonsense.html">a compilation of their
	work</a> was shooting up the American alternative charts.
	They arrived, bewildered, <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Jul17.html">in New York</a>, to find their
	album at Number 2, and muddled their way through the
	North American summer, playing at the top of their form,
	drinking out of brown paper bags, and striking terror
	into the Americans by wearing long trousers.
	<p />
	Felix left to court a lady in Montreal, and was replaced
	by ${lohan}, while ${green}, an associate of David J.,
	joined on saxophone.  ${dist} was released in October
	1986 and the five piece band that toured Britain and
	Europe in support made a mighty sound; but it was not to
	last.  <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Nov27.html">On a
	particularly grim night in Switzerland</a> too much
	liquor, fatigue, stress and frustration drove Max and the
	Butcher to engage in a spectacular outbreak of
	dressing-room-fu, which resulted in Max receding from
	view on a train the following morn.  The remaining
	members finished the tour, the last show being in
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Dec20.html">Zaragoza on 20th
	December 1986</a>
	<p />
	Mister Jones moved to Germany, where he found new fame
	gardening for Gunter Grass, playing for the Lost T-Shirts
	of Atlantis and for his own band, Shakespeare And The
	Bible.  ${max} released his solo L.P., ${best_kisser} in
	the summer of 1987, but was ill-served by his record
	company.  He can still be seen playing live in London and
	Hamburg.  ${dj} is in ${rocket} and Felix is a
	photographer.  The Butcher and Alex Green resurfaced
	about a year down the road on ${creat}.
	<p />
	In the years they recorded for Glass Records the JBC made
	four studio albums, <a href="${jbc_albums}/hamburg.html">a
	live L.P.</a> and eight singles, none of which have been
	available for almost ten years.  This collection offers
	some of the best moments from that period.  From the
	primitive early sound of ${foot} (where the Butcher plays
	drums) to the elaborate soundscapes of ${domest} and
	${angels} it charts the progress of a gang of friends who
	stumbled unprepared into a music scene of which they were
	often deeply suspicious, but which gave them more then
	they had ever imagined.  Here is music that won the
	admiration of figures as wildly diverse as Mark E. Smith,
	Tom Waits, REM, Andrew Eldritch, and Alan McGee.
	Heartfelt, thoughtless tunes of classic pop, high on
	hedonism and sharp of tongue: 'eccentric' perhaps by the
	meretricious standards of the times, but they've nearly
	all got drums.  Come a little closer, and enjoy.

   Millions of years ago, dinosaurs ruled the Earth.
    Today the Galileo Space Probe orbits mighty planet Jupiter.
    The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy first appeared in June 1982
    <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1982/Jun12.html">in the back room
    of the Black Lion in Northampton</a>.
    They finally drank the bar dry in a small town
    <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1996/Aug20.html">in Mallorca on
    the 20th August 1996</a>.
    On the achievement of this ambition, the most
    deconstruction-resistant beat group of our times
    finally has the grace to call it a day.
    What they leave on this disc is a collection of some
    of the more popular tunes from their long and chaotic
    association with the ${creat} label.
    <p />
    1. ${yo}
    <blockquote>
    The first take of the "${blue}" sessions:
    four desperate men in a haunted room.
    ${lix}'s fuel-air blasts and some two-wheeled
    cornering from Mister ${paul} drive this heads-down squalid
    tale of bad people doing bad things.
    </blockquote>
    2. ${odd}
    <blockquote>
    Written at Basement Fish, the JBC's secret
    central London base, about the man
    next door.  Neither Mister Odd nor
    Harry, the proprietor of the basement
  are with us now.  God rest their souls.
    </blockquote>
    3. ${drugs}
    <blockquote>
    Inspired by a photo in a sixties college
    yearbook and written in a Texas motel
    room, this owes a large musical debt to
    L.A. band ${mildew}, which the Butcher
    somehow thought he could
    make up by shouting, "Hey, Charlie"
    over the guitar solo.
    </blockquote>
    4. ${kid}
    <blockquote>
    One will appreciate that a few years have
    passed since this was written.  He is
    Bicycle Bloke now.  One day he will
    hear this tune and the Butcher will be
    toast: "${kid} - the jumped up
    B-side that ruined my life."
    </blockquote>
    5. ${wrong}
    <blockquote>
    In 1987, ${green} and the Bucher <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1987">toured
    France for a month</a> in a small car with a
    crazed and almost totally blind Parisian
    punk rocker and a tour manager called
    Captain Dogboy.  It is an indication of
    their state of mind that they actually
    considered using this title.  Five minutes
    of squelching noises, basically.
    </blockquote>
    6. ${chick}
    <blockquote>
    Blind drunk and totally broke, the JBC bite
    the hand that feeds them.  Careering
    unsteadily towards thirty, with the
    Thatcher thing beginning to bite, the
    Butcher goes into one, and a sinister
    man called ${iain} commit the
    resultant din to tape.
    </blockquote>
    7. ${sis}
    <blockquote>
    One week into the Nineties and the JBC hit a
    creative peak in a Norfolk farmhouse.
    Just back from <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1990">a mad American tour</a>,
    shocked at the seriousness of ${kizzy}'s
    illness, their personal lives in chaos,
    they go for commercial suicide and
    accidentally make their best album
    in years.  Spooky.
    </blockquote>
    8. ${girls}
    <blockquote>
    A lunge at the Serge-coloured pervy corner,
    this may or may not be inspired by an
    anti-Vietnam War poster.  Features one
    of the Bucther's more graceful lyrics
    and the first recorded contribution of
    dangerously moody guitarist and
    owner-of-all-the-beer, ${pete}.
    </blockquote>
    9. ${filth}
    <blockquote>
    Czech underground techno band ${eg}
    caused something of a fuss when they
    accused the Butcher of stealing this tune
    from them, even going so far as to call
    the JBC and ${creat} "pig"
    <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1992/Jun26.html">on
    the radio</a>.  The tousands of AC/DC fans
    sampled here have also lodged expensive
    royalty claims, which means thet the
    Butcher will have to work until he is
    over a hundred years old just to pay
    them all off.
    </blockquote>
    10. ${sweet}
    <blockquote>
    Two snapshots from <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1992">the US tour of 1992</a>,
    specifically a splendid night at
    the Sweetwater Springs Saloon, Los Osos,
    Ca. involving a giant refrigerator full of
    Jaegermeister, and a twenty-four hour
    binge in New Orleans.  More romantic
    than it probably sounds.
    </blockquote>
    11. ${whad}
    <blockquote>
    The bleached-out sound of a post-hysteric
    Butcher with real submarine noises
    from ${davis} resonating in the ${richard} Flotation
    Tank.  Try to imagine the Sound Of Philadelphia
    filtered through a
    schizophrenically diassociative
    hangover on a freezing morning
    thousands of miles from home.
    </blockquote>
    12. ${ghost}
    <blockquote>
    So you're mad.  So you're gonna kill me.
    So how long do you think I'll care?
    </blockquote>
    13. ${tues}
    <blockquote>
    December 1989: high in the hills of Southern
    California a dazed JBC tucks into
    speciality ice-creams in a cowboy bar.
    It is Tuesday.  Like elephants, the JBC do
    not forget.  They agree that this would
    make a fine soundtrack for a film of
    their bus driving down a long, straight
    desert road somewhere in Spain.
    </blockquote>
    14. ${shirl}
    <blockquote>
    We're right in the middle of the 1991
    firestorm here.  ${lix} (Gibson 335) and
    ${richard} (sixties science-fiction Vox affair)
    do battle in a darkened room full of toxic fumes.
    Lix is standing on a chair.
    The rest of the JBC are doing their nuts
    on the sofa.  This is all that is keeping them going.
    </blockquote>
    15. ${go}
    <blockquote>
    There is a place outside of space and time,
    visited by the illuminated and the
    terminally schizophrenic alike. Here,
    where all is spread out below, there is a
    sound at once soothing and disturbing.
    It is the sound of the inner circles of
    ${richard}'s mind, and is it
    captured for you on the closing minute of this, the JBC's
    own spooked misappropriation of the Petula Clarke
    classic, <i>"Downtown"</i>.

    The last thing anybody expected was a new Jazz Butcher album in the
    year 2000.  But there is one, and it's just the sort of thing that you
    hardcore JBC listeners are going to enjoy.  Stick with me.
    The record is called "Glorious and Idiotic" and it is released on 26th
    January 2000 on ROIR (Reach Out International Records) of New York City.
    That's right, Virginia, it's a domestic US release.  It is a live recording
    of the concert which Max and Owen and I played in Hamburg's Logo club
    in February 1999.  It marks Owen's return to the JBC, and, in retrospect,
    it marks the return of the JBC itself as some kind of going concern.
    It has by far the best sound quality of any of the Jazz Butcher live
    albums or bootlegs currently available.  The performances aren't bad
    either, for a bunch of old bastards.  It features lots of old favourites
    and two brand new songs by Max Eider, both performed for the first time
    ever at this concert.  It also features guest appearances from our Euro-buddies
    Clemens, Curtis and Pat Beirne, three of the finest human beings you
    could be lucky enough to meet (by the way).

    Pat and I go back a long way.  I've always been a Butcher fan, although
    it's no secret that there was a brief period when I would have liked
    to have killed him, dismembered his body, buried the parts at the four
    corners of the earth and visited each in turn to have a bit of a dance.
    I felt sure he would have done the same for me.  <i>[Actually, I never entertained
    these kind of thoughts about The Talented One, but now that he comes to
    mention it, it does sound like a bit of a laugh - Ed.]</i>
    <p />
    But that was a long time ago.
    We never quite cut the knot, and so it is - through a strange mixture of complicity,
    happenstances, hard liquor and Vinyl Japan - that we cam to make this record.
    We have nothing but good to say of Vinyl Japan, but I'm sure they won't mind
    my pointing out that it's been made
    on the cheap.  This involved Pat in becoming a bass player and virtual
    drummer, among other things (leave it, Crouchy), and I had many happy visits
    to Northampton NN1 to pursue conversations such as: 'Barrapadap.' 'What,
    brapadap?' 'No, barrapadap.' 'Oh, barrapadap ... I see.'
    <p />
    Anyway, the main purpose of these notes is to give thanks and thanks are
    primarily due to co-conspiratorial guitar player ${pete}, who owns the
    house and a good deal of the queipment and patience that made this record
    possible.  The other main conspirators are listed elsewhere on this sleeve.  Also
    conniving were: Agent Russell Cooper; ${gab} (aka Inexxor); Ian Botterill (courtesy
    of Fat Controller); ${curt} (we are not worthy);
    Paul Taylor; Tetsuya Nakatani; John Whitfield and all at Vinyl Japan; and, unwittingly
    but gratefully, the proprietors of the local boozer and off-license.  Little
    Jake and Hobbu thank Richard Morris.  And then there's you, of course, assuming
    that you've actually shelled out some of your hard-earned cash to listen to
    this product of disgusted, disappointed, dissipated and rotten souls.

    In March 1985, when ${dj} joind ${rocket}, the Jazz Butcher Group introduced
    their new bassist ${felix} to a hundred or so unconcerned punters in a conference
    suite in a Northampton basement.
    <p />
    Soon after that night, promoted by ace photographer ${mitch} (who also happened
    to be the Butcher's flatmate at the time), the Hand Of Hinc intervened, with the
    result that the band swiftly grew accostomed to ceaseless touring, stumbling and
    shouting their way across England, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Austria,
    Switzerland and Spain.
    <p />
    Sometimes they would play two shows in the same evening.  Sometimes there was trouble
    "Is he always like that?" was becoming something of a catch phrase.  It had reached the point where,
    if he wasn't actually playing a show or making a record, the Butcher would spend his time shouting
    at his long-suffering agent down the phone because, frankly, having "gone professional", he no
    longer had anything else to do.
    <p />
    But the summer of 1985 was good to the JBC in a violent sort of way.  Despite the many injuries
    sustained during the band's first brush with Spain, they were in high spirits.  Possibly they
    thought they were indestructible.  (Given that at the time of writing they have just completed
    their seventh US tour and their first club dates in Japan, perhaps they are.  We may never know).
    <p />
    So let us join our ungainly crew as they jet off one September Friday with a view to playing
    a festival date in the south of Germany <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/Sep7.html">the following night.</a>
    Having been met by their promoter,
    a very small man in a very large Mercedes, the band are delighted to discover that the
    festival is in a tiny Alpine village rejoicing in the locally typical but nonetheless
    laughably quaint name of Trochtelfingen.
    They drink like sailors and demand money with menaces from the promoter (successfully,
    as it goes, poor mug!) before retiring in a polite and orderly fashion to their small,
    charming, family-run village hotel.  Friday night in Schwaben.  No problem at all.
    <p />
    Saturday dawns bright and lovely.  The hotel is all abuzz, for there is to be a wedding.
    The JBC nod and beam sweetly at the natives before leaving to do a lunchtime soundcheck
    in a massive candy-striped tent in an Alpine meadow.  It is a fine, professional soundcheck,
    it goes on for awhile, during which the band do not waste the opportunity to renew their
    still fresh and passionate affair with German beer.
    <p />
    In the afternoon the band's German agent, Joachim, takes the JBC to the extraordinary
    Schloss Liechtenstein nearby.  As they explore the mad fairy-tale castle perched high on a
    cliff above the village, The Butcher and ${max} are faintly spooked while Felix beams, resplendent
    in grey leather trousers, black shirt open to the waist and fake leopardskin jacket.
    ${owen} is nowhere to be seen, but those who are curious about his movements are
    recommended to check out his recordings with his band Shakespeare And The Bible.
    The posse sits and smokes thoughtfully under a huge and ancient tree outside the castle.
    It is a peaceful and idyllic afternoon.  With beer.
    <p />
    In a disturbing prophetic photograph the JBC can be seen posing at the castle gates.
    The Butcher is good-naturedly throttling his German agent, while ${kizzy} is
    taking the opportunity to thrust his half-eaten Mars Bar into the singer's ear.
    <p />
    It is around teatime that the cracks begin to show.  Returning to the hotel, the JBC
    discover a number of things and the number is four:
    <br />1. The wedding party is in full swing in the restaurant.
    <br />2. There is a trolley loaded with all manner of elaborate
    German cakes just sitting there all on its own in the hall.
    <br />3. The newlyweds have left their hotel room door open.
    <br />4. Nobody is paying any attention to the JBC
    <p />
    Felix is straight into action.  Seeing that many of the cakes
    have already been partially eaten, he figures that nobody is going to miss them, now.
    With commendable foresight he decides to liberate a few of them for later in the evening, in case
    anyone feels a bit peckish, like.  It is while stealthily concealing the cakes in Room 27 that he and
    the Butch find the happy couple's door open.  Within minutes their bathroom is entirely stuffed
    with the hotel's extensive collection of massive pot plants, with a large and elaborate model boat
    awaiting any intrepid expolorer who makes it as far as the bathtub.
    <p />
    As the sun goes down the JBC slip discreetly from the hotel and up to the massive candy-striped tent.
    Here all is rock and roll, although, with hindsight, the photographs do indicate that the stage
    lights might have tended towards a possibly unnecessary shade of hot pink.  Still, the JBC
    rock the tent, take the cash money and continue their research into the amount of
    vodka that can be poured down the singer's throat.
    <p />
    The Butcher doesn't know it yet, but he has already eaten the last meat that will ever
    pass his lips. As the band troop into a local restaurant for a well-earned dinner
    the excitable singer spots a tank full of live crayfish.  "Uh-oh" he thinks, "Its' a
    Which-One-Would-You-Like-Murdered-And-Delivered-To-Your-Plate Sir Scenario".
    <p />
    In a fit of well-meaning but spurious solidarity The Butcher joins Messrs Eider and Jones on the
    vegetarian tip.  It later transpires that the crayfish are, in fact, house pets.  By
    such misunderstandings do we change our lives.
    <p />
    Back at the hotel, all is quiet.  Sadly, it appears that the band has missed the shrieking
    from the bridal suite.  The JBC gather for vodka and cake in Room 27.  The mood is satisfied,
    peaceful. There is happy, animated conversation and none of it is about trashing hotel rooms.
    Drinks and cakes are passed around.
    <p />
    There is no way of predicting the moment.  The Butcher is sitting on the floor,
    leaning against Felix's bed enjoying a massive and particularly well-preserved
    chocolate cake when in a moment of festal stupidity he makes the fatal mistake
    of taking a tiny lump of chocolate and flicking it towards the lead guitarist.
    In seconds Eider is upon him, seizing the cake and grinding it in its entirety into
    the hapless Butcher's face forever.  It all goes off.
    <p />
    Remember: these are men who have had their whole lives in the shadow of the Cold War Bomb.
    They understood concepts like "escalation" and "massive pre-emptive strike".  Within
    minutes large areas of Room 27 are chocolate-plastered no-go zones and Eider finds himself
    forcibly imprisioned in the bathroom, a wardrobe pushed up against the door for
    added security.  He responds as any reasonable man would under the circumstances.
    He riots.
    <p />
    Negotiations go on for some time before The Talented One succeeds in arguing his
    way to freedom.  Sadly not for the first time European treaty is soon betrayed
    and once again appaling cake abuse breaks out.  By now there is not a white surface
    in the room.  Eventually the Konditoreisturmgruppe runs out of vodka and curls
    up in the wreckage to sleep.
    <p />
    At an unusually early hour on Sunday morning the JBC are in the car park, loading
    into the back of the van.  They move suprisingly quickly and silently for men in
    their condition.  Kizzy and Mister Jones have spent the last half hour desperately stuffing
    slick brown bedclothes into the wardrobe of Room 27.  As they make their final exit from
    the hotel they pass a pair of young chamber maids heading in the opposite direction.
    Just as they gain the lobby they hear a great and deeply comical shriek from upstairs.
    <p />
    The JBC bus goes tearing out of the car park, headed for Stuttgart Airport at some speed.
    After some five or ten miles the band spot a German Police car on the road behind them.
    Giggling hysteria is not far away as the tour manager puts on his best German accent
    to announce: "Ja... we would like to have a word with you about some... cakes."

    <b>FREE LUNCH</b>
    <p />
    Curtis E. Johnson once said to me about the JBC: "You're not a band. You're
    a crack team of international restaurant critics." Guilty as charged.
    Stevie G and I were talking about it just the other day. All over the world
    you can meet people, who, in a desperate attempt to let you know that
    they're bang up to date with what's going on out there, will tell you:
    "There's no such thing as a free lunch"; whereas to us musicians the free
    lunch is a central shaft of our cosmology.
    <p />
    Next time some patronising time-server feels like letting you in on the Big
    Secret and tells you "there's no such thing as a free lunch", buy him one.
    Take him to a restaurant, sit him down, wine him and dine him. Then send
    him on his way with the Star of India's finest dhansak in his belly and a
    flea in his ear. Who knows? You might just have tweaked his worldview a
    point or two towards the sunnier side of the street. You'll certainly have
    shown him that he didn't know what he was talking about.
    <p />
    There is the remote possibility that, once the espressos have been drained
    and it's time for you to shell out, your new companion might try to go for
    his wallet. "No, no, I couldn't possibly let you pay the bill," he
    declaims. Waving of hands may be involved. Here is a man in particular need
    of your immediate and practical help. Here you are, trying to pay for his
    lunch, but his personal Weltanschauung won't permit it. How far up himself?
    All the way, I'm afraid, season ticket holder, sits on the board of the
    Consumers' Action Council, organises the knees-up every Christmas, salt-of-
    the-earth.
    Oh, I'm sorry. Remain firm. Pay the bill for both of you.
    <p />
    Alan McGee, in his foreword to Jackie Young's book "Backward Glances"
    (Creation 1995), wrote that whenever one of his deluded pop singers phoned
    up from abroad to moan about life on the road, he'd remind them that they
    could always try working down a mine. Right on the money once again, Mister
    President.
    <p />
    A lot of the stuff you read about little rock bands touring the globe is
    foolish myth. The expected tales of wild excess, for example, perpetuated
    by writers who could barely handle the lifestyle for more than a couple of
    days at some cushy location carefully selected by the record company, which
    is paying their fare and their minibar bill. Then we have to wrestle with
    the myths of Dreadful Squalor. These tend to be perpetuated by a certain
    kind of musician, who can't handle the lifestyle either, God bless, but who
    has sublimated this beneath a preening self-importance which renders
    perfectly good gigs, hotels, vehicles and restaurants into an unending
    slough of Things Which Are Not Good Enough For Him. (Or Her, Miss Carey.)
    For example, has anybody ever read "Nico; Songs They Never Play On The
    Radio" without having, ever so fleetingly, the feeling that something is
    up? If things are truly as vile and debased as the author likes to make
    out, doesn't that make him just a bit of mug for being a part of it? Or is
    he taking a hypocritical pot-shot at his old touring companions?
    <p />
    He does, it must be said, paint a glorious picture of The Great Paolo
    Bedini.
    <p />
    Paolo Bedini is one of the truly wonderful things about touring what the
    ignorant, the ungrateful and the chemically-dependent like to describe as
    "the toilets". A chess prodigy, he was thwarted when his mother wouldn't
    permit him to go to an important championship in the Soviet Union, so
    somehow he became a music promoter. Paolo stirs two teaspoonfuls of sugar
    into a small glass of orange juice. For some time the windscreen of his car
    was held on by gaffa tape.
    <p />
    When you work for Paolo you enter a zone of un-knowingness, where matters
    like time and space are seen from a completely different, serenely detached
    viewpoint high in the foothills of modern Italian consciousness. If you
    persist on trying to follow your normal, sadly materialist agenda, you will
    find yourself growing ever more confused and frustrated, as you try to
    establish
    <p />
    Where you are now;
    The relationship between where you are now and where you are, in fact,
    supposed to be now;
    Where you are supposed to be later on;
    When that might be;
          and
    What you should be doing to ensure that it might be so.
    <p />
    It is hot in Italy and if you think this way you will go mad. Your brain
    will shrivel to the size of a walnut and you will die alone and insane in a
    sanatorium just outside of Guildford as the crows on the plane tree outside
    your window say vile things about your evil, useless life.
    <p />
    The truth is that there is learning, enlightenment and many free lunches to
    be had from a Bedini Special. In September 1985 the JBC were flattered to
    land a show in the ancient Greek ampthitheatre in Syracusa in Sicily. (Call
    that a toilet, if you dare.) The PA caught fire and the show ended in
    enthusiastic pointless shouting and the singer getting a visit from Jesus.
    The following morning all the members of the JBC and their hangovers were
    told that they could not fly home on the appointed aeroplane, something of
    a nuisance, which the bass player darkly intimated to be work of the Mafia.
    "So, if they don't like us.why do they want to keep us here on their
    manor?" reasoned the marginally more logical players. We sat and drank
    coffee in the airport while Bedini was sent for.
    <p />
    We knew that Paolo would have a scheme. On this occasion it turned out that
    the first step was to book the entire band onto a flight to Milan. This was
    achieved without too much difficulty. Arrived at Milan, we watched open-
    mouthed as a van was rented. We then drove through the gathering twilight
    across hill roads to Genoa. A plane would take us home from Genoa airport:
    this was the not-entirely-convincing official line from our promoter. Of
    course, we arrived to find Genoa's tiny airport closed up for the night. It
    must have been at least eight thirty in the evening.
    <p />
    Entirely unphazed, Paolo had us drive on into Genoa where he booked the
    whole crew into a downtown hotel before taking us out to dinner. We could
    not believe our luck. He was acting as though it was the most normal thing
    in the world.
    <p />
    Over dinner, which, being Italian, was exceptionally fine, Plan B was
    revealed to a shell-shocked and disbelieving band. Pretty self-evidently,
    all this piling around Italy in various forms of transport had taken
    something of a toll on the finances, and Paolo explained that it would be a
    lot easier and cheaper for him to send the band home in separate groups of
    two or three by train. One or two could go tomorrow, the others a day or
    two later when Paolo had sorted out the necessary wedge. It was decided
    that Max and Owen would be the first to set off, the following morning. The
    rest of us got to stay in the hotel for two or three days, milling around
    Genoa (which is lovely) and meeting up regularly with Paolo for endless
    free lunches and dinners. I still can't believe my luck.
    <p />
    Later, back in the UK, I found out that the reason that Paolo acted so
    calmly, as though everything was normal, was that - as far as he was
    concerned - it was. My pal Rolo had had an almost identical experience with
    Il Gran Bedini only a few months before. Days of free lunches! What a
    gentleman! The JBC loved him so much that we named an Award after him,
    specifically the Award for local promoter of the year, which from 1985 on
    became known as The Golden Bedini.
    <p />
    And while I'm talking about Italy, a big shout must go out to our friends
    and supporters, Giancarlo Susanna and Leo Mansueto, without whom all our
    Italian adventures would probably never have come to pass, and I would
    never have met Paolo Bedini.
    We love you!
    <p />
    The great truth of all this is that life on the road is positively
    luxurious in comparison to the lives that most musicians live when they are
    not working. You get to stay in hotels, eat out in restaurants, learn
    languages, history and politics. You get to show off, you drink stupid
    quantities of free liquor, you get into nightclubs for free. You get to DJ
    on foreign radio stations (Once, in Wisconsin, they even let me read the
    news), the gas stations sell beer, cigarettes are cheap and the drugs are
    free. Let's face it, the only people you ever meet are the ones that either
    like your music or have to pretend to as part of their job. (Well, them and
    The Authorities.) All you have to worry about is where you are supposed to
    be at six o'clock tomorrow evening.
    <p />
    All right: strictly, the touring musician adventurer tends to enjoy a lot
    more free dinners than lunches, when kindly local promoters try to feed you
    up in readiness for el gran espectacolo del rock. I once knew a German tour
    promoter who thought it was a very dubious idea for the drummer to be a
    vegetarian. And, yes, it's probably true that these luxurious dinners out
    are accounted for in some contingency fund among the promoter's expertly
    and cautiously calculated expenses; but it's not as though you, the
    musician, will ever see any of that paperwork. No, from where you're
    sitting, that is near enough to a free lunch for jazz. And over the years,
    the JBC have enjoyed some very good ones.
    <p />
    I've heard and read terrible stories about British bands going abroad and
    complaining incessantly about the absence of good old Kwiksave favourites
    like Captain Birdseye or canned beans. There are the tales, almost too sad
    to be told, of allegedly creative people dragging a massive tea urn around
    with them wherever they play. Just about everybody in the JBC was happy to
    make do and mend with whatever came along in the way of food and drink,
    and, having gazed thereupon, I'm not surprised.
    <p />
    Years after the event, certain dinners stand out every bit as strongly as
    certain shows. It is time to give credit where it has been due.
    <p />
    <b>Taberna Bar Bajamar, Calle Gorbea, Gasteiz - Spring 88</b>
    <p />
    Simple, unpretentious, endless dining delight, served by a telepath.
    A legendary dining experience, universally agreed by all who were there to
    be the finest meal that this band has ever been served.
    <p />
    <b>Restaurant Kalash, Clermont-Ferrand - Spring 94</b>
    <p />
    A Pakistani restaurant of staggering sophistication in a back street in
    France's answer to Sheffield. An unexpected oasis of calm and civilisation,
    to be sure, but the food was so delicate, so delicious, so plentiful that
    it remains unforgettable.
    <p />
    <b>The Opera Nutter, Reggio nell' Emilia - December 1986</b>
    <p />
    Somewhere in the countryside the Red Bus pulled up at a barn. A barn with
    flashing disco lights and opera playing at brain-crushing volume. In these
    unlikely surroundings we were served endless courses of transcendentally
    good Italian peasant cooking by a dangerous maniac. I can hardly believe it
    really happened.
    <p />
    <b>God-Fearing Erie, Pa. - Spring 2000</b>
    <p />
    In a guerilla-booking operation, a pack of JBC lovers invited us to play
    their local pub, using their flat as a base camp. Here they installed their
    pal, who just happened to the head chef at the best restaurant in town.
    Roasted elephant garlic with brie and custom-made quesadillas, all
    accompanied by beers of the highest quality, Polish vodka and jazz
    cheroots, while watching Premiership football on TV - in America! Superb!
    <p />
    <b>Vereinhaus, Dornbirn - Mar 88</b>
    <p />
    When the JBC first stumbled upon this fine Austrian dining room at Easter
    1985 we discovered that they did a rather wonderful thing with deep-fried
    mushrooms. We have been going back there ever since. Of course, these days
    "breaded mushrooms" have come to the pubs and restaurants of the UK. But
    what a nasty little mess of microwaved cack they truly are when compared
    with the Real Thing. Available only at the Vereinhaus, a JBC classic!
    <p />

    <b>Written Warning:</b>
    <p />
    The next time that I find myself called upon to provide sleeve notes for
    yet another instalment of the ongoing JBC Pointless Compilation Library, I
    shall feel myself compelled to relate the story of what happened in the
    Empire Diner in October 1990. Record companies (especially Chrysalis), BBC
    employees and former members of the Blue Aeroplanes band should approach
    their legal representatives now. Not that it will do them any good.  The
    Red Bus sped on long ago.

    <b>LAST OF THE GENTLEMAN ADVENTURERS</b>
    <p />
    The Cuban heels are worn down to their cuticle and the spring-loaded derringer has rusted in position up a shiny sleeve. Crows bowl across the Racecourse like black boa tumbleweeds and far too many of the other wanted-poster names are long since taken down: that absent rack of painted clogs in Birchfield Road, an admixture of alcohol and DNA still percolating through Jack Lansbury's spit-trap, Freddy Fingers' glass eye rolling to a standstill on the empty dance-floor, all gone, all auditioned for the Boot Hill Boogie Boys or otherwise dispersed. Inside the legendary saloon, its bar-length mirrors and its framed reclining nudes all plasterboarded now, conviviality swept out through a swing door the moment everybody's cards were on the table. This must be the famous palace that those four-lane highways of excess were always leading to, that makes a body scrape a chair up and take stock.
    <p />
    With blood from an interminable improv on his cleaver ... people say he uses every last bit of a slaughtered solo clarinet except its squeal ... the Jazz Butcher, one of this threadbare island's greatest living songwriters, herein purveys his choicest cuts. All left to hang as part of their extensive maturation process, melodies so tender that they're falling off the bone, a gamey sweetness in the lyrics, this sumptuous salmagundi has the flavour of a signature dish, something left till last.
    <p />
    A work that speaks from a hard-earned perspective and means every word of it, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers is a delightfully ill-humoured reassessment of contemporary culture and the dwindling amount of room remaining for a gentleman adventurer within it. From the atavistic primate yearnings for a vanished jungle-land in `Animals' to the elegiac message-in-a-bottle bobbing on an eerie Californian surf in `Shakey', what we're offered is a scuffed and well-stamped passport to the gone world, stained with Tokay, singed by oval cigarettes you'll never see again. The fatalistic Gallic shrug of `Tombé dans les pommes' lifts a dismissive brow at life's vicissitudes, while `Count Me Out' speaks of the dignified withdrawal from a situation that's no longer either interesting or acceptable.
    <p />
    Far from a weary resignation letter, though, the pieces here more accurately represent a flinty and determined manifesto, a defiant staking out of the unsupervised and teeming wasteland to which our illustrious former territory has been reduced, a vital roster of remaining freedoms. Whether that be in appreciating the bohemian elan of next-door's quadruped or instigating a romance we may be hard pressed to survive, these songs are testimonials to life, perhaps especially to life at bay. The bluesy and relentless rocket of `Solar Core' provides a glorious reminder to select our destination carefully, and never be found wanting in ambition. `All the Saints' and its affecting coda spell out the emotionally conservationist agenda, with a spirited dismissal of irrelevant modernity in favour of pursuing vitally important individual dreams.
    <p />
    This luminous, enduring truth resides at the collection's beating, beaten heart, reiterated eloquently in the title track itself, curling its lip at those who have mistaken BUPA and increased consumer choice for liberty, inciting us to man up and define that precious resource for ourselves. With Messrs Harries, Eider and Mattock as his bearers, the last of the gentleman adventurers here buckles up his pith-helmet and mounts a reckless foray into the interior, heads in the last remaining unexplored direction, the implicit fifth point on our compass. Follow at your peril, from the trail of snapped conventions left behind him, to a province still outside captivity. I'll see you there.

	This inaugural disk is decidedly un-Butcheresque, with a keyboard-heavy attack of quasi-techno rhythms. Pat was known to dabble in reverb and noise, but the results were moody, melancholy textures, quite unlike the flash of This is Sumo.

		The Jazz Butcher cover version is unavailable elsewhere. Interestingly
		enough, the same must be said about the other contributions ... The
		Rag Dolls were an early and short-living band of Dave Kusworth
		(Jacobites), <i>Missionary Boy</i> features Nikki Sudden
		himself on vocals
		(and is therefore better than the version that appears on <b>The
		Bible Belt</b> LP with Lizard on vocals) while Sad Go Round was The
		Swell Maps (!) in disguise. Obviously essential, this highly sought
		after split single came with a fanzine.

    1984, my friend Dave Seabright bought the ‘Marnie’ 7” and I bought the 12”. ‘Butch’ became my first musician ‘mate’. I don’t mean we used to hang out and drink together but for a while we corresponded regularly: letters and postcards, long phone calls and we’d swap tapes and suggest bands that each other should listen to.
    <p />
    When Dave Driscoll and I decided to put the ‘Abigail’s Birthday Party’ tape together, we approached a number of bands asking for contributions. There were a lot of no replies and a lot of "nothing to spare" messages which put a huge dent in our confidence. Then we received a tape from Pat with about half a dozen songs to choose from! That’s how we ended up with ‘Olof Palme’, an exclusive at that time!

    In the early '80s, ${barker} was checking master vinyl copies of classical recordings for glitches - they don't make jobs like that anymore. In his spare time he discovered innovative souls struggling to make music and welcomed them to his Glass Records label. The roll call included Teenage Fanclub, Spacemen 3, The Pastels and The Jazz Butcher.
    <p />
    The 'Butcher' delivered a gaggle of albums and many 45s for Glass from 1983 to 1986, the jacket notes on the dusty tome that recalls this period mentions Randall And Hopkirk (Deceased), Thatcher, DIY post-punk, LSD, surrealist cabaret, The Velvet Underground, a bottle of Cointreau or two, the Amstrad 7090 and Ronco's 'Black Magic' compilation. All that led to the 'The Wasted Years': Four albums, many visions...
    <p />
    '${bacon}' was an experiment in sound, conjoining that Ronco platter to Todd Rundgren, a guitar from Wes Montgomery's cupboard and mentions of imaginary monsters set to some funky chops. "The sound of a few mates failing to take note that they've an LP to make!" claims the JB site. It's pop meets bluesy scat with plenty of deadpan irony - a theme that will recur.
    <p />
    '${scandal}' took a "competent little rock band" with a bassist who'd served time in Bauhaus into a world chorused by multi-track vocals and bathroom ambience. "A top-shelf diamond of a record that is filled with excellent, memorable songs." (All Music).
    <p />
    '${sex}' offered a broadening perspective. Competence and European travel beget a narrative akin to an impressionistic cold war spy movie, a "mess of styles" that became coherent. "A great album," muses All Music before comparing JB mainman Pat Fish to Ray Davies circa 1969. It's an "accidental" concept album prone to fleeting melancholy.
    <p />
    '${dist}', ahead of the original band's demise through "fatigue and liquor" was the Butcher's stab at making their "greatest album ever". "A beautifully romantic record of soft rock ballads and jazzy torch songs," enthused Trouser Press. There's a folky edge scratching away beside the inevitable romp through pop music's historical lineage.
    <p />
    Four albums, then. The '80s recast at an ironic party of malcontents. Indie pop as a soundtrack. Songs that shouldn't fit together - but do. 'Wasted Years'? Yeah, really.

	Note: The back cover mistakenly lists the Jazz Butcher track as "President Gang".
	The information printed on the CD itself is correct.
	This CD was a "promotional only" issue.

	The Jazz Butcher’s Brave New Waves session was recorded on ${linkInternal(/gigs/1988/Jun5.html, June 5th, 1988)} in CBC Studio 13 in Montreal.  The recording is taken from CBC Archives reels and remastered at Grey Market Mastering in Montreal, by Harris Newman.
#define	albums[76]->notes
    Little known fact! The Jazz Butcher's fabulous Brave New Waves session is one of the only sessions that ever got an official release, as the b-side of an EP called Spooky in the late 80s. Now hopelessly out of print, the session gets new life as part of the Brave New Waves series from Artoffact Records. This release includes a never-heard bonus track, a download card with bonus interviews, and completely updated and revised artwork, partially modified from the original Spooky sleeve art.
    <p />
    Led by Oxford philosophy graduate Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher himself) and featuring a dazzling array of co-conspirators (including David Jay of Love And Rockets and Bauhaus fame), The Jazz Butcher is one of the longest running and most cult pop bands in Britain, having recorded some 15 albums since its founding in 1982. The band was one of the gems on the Creation Records roster, and has recently seen an incredible reissue series on Fire Records.
    <p />
    The Jazz Butcher's Brave New Waves session was recorded on ${linkInternal(/gigs/1988/Jun5.html, June 5th, 1988)} in CBC Studio 13 in Montreal. The recording features cameos by both ${kevin} (Rational Youth) and ${brent} (the Brave New Waves host). An over the top rendition of "Sex Engine" includes a memorable dig at Skinny Puppy, as well as at other Canadian icons. The recording is taken from CBC Archives reels and remastered at Grey Market Mastering in Montreal, by Harris Newman.

	It's not often that an artist gets to do a Bowie by consciously carving their personal epitaph into the grooves of their final LP. The Highest in the Land is that rarity of an album, and it could not have been made by a more brilliantly poetic and fearlessly sarcastic writer than Pat Fish, also known as The Jazz Butcher.

	We finally asked Pat if he wanted to record one and he said he wouldn’t do a Christmas song, but he would record something … and oh did he do something special for us. He came round and recorded a beautiful version of Afterhours
#define	albums[91]->notes
Starting in the early 2000’s a friend of mine, Andy Clarke, started recording a Christmas Album each year to give away to friends and clients. They started as a bit of a joke based around his fictional alta ego “Uncle Andy” best described as a lecherous, fraudster, man of the cloth. Over the next few years more and more musicians became involved not just from The New Barcelona but from around the world, some still jokey but more and more they became serious production numbers.
<p />
In 2007 the storyline for that years album was Uncle Andy’s huge charity gig, which at the end of he obviously stole all the takings. That year we finally asked Pat if he wanted to record one and he said he wouldn’t do a Christmas song, but he would record something … and oh did he do something special for us. He came round and recorded a beautiful version of Afterhours from the 3rd Velvet Underground album.
