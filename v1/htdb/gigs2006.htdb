			November, Dave is back and this time he's brought the artillery. He will be leading a three piece band whose track record includes
			legendary Birmingham band the Subterranean Hawks and John Peel favourites The Nightingales. Expect a night of full-on rock and roll, pumped
			up and dirty in all the right ways. More info at: ${g_artistweb(g=http://www.davekusworth.com)}

			JOE WOOLLEY

			A welcome return to Masters of Budvar for our favourite local troubadour. Joe has been rocking himself up of late, working with Jon Mattock
			(Slipstream) and Luke Goddard (The On/Offs) to add muscle and swing to his elegant
			folk-blues style. As he starts to play more and more London shows, it looks as though Joe is on his way to some
			well-deserved success. Always worth checking out. See ${g_artistweb(g=http://www.joewoolley.com)}

			A nice trip to Oxfodd on Saturday night. Russ Cooper drove us all down there and brought various drums and shakey things with which to accompany me and my big            wooden tape-recorder.
			<p />
			We took our time over soundchecking - this time there were even monitors...which was nice. A quick veggie-burger at the Turkish take-away           over the street and a little creative paperwork in the carpark, then we were back in the venue with a foming beaker of Budvar, all set to continue the JBC
			Hardcore's survey of the glorious history of Raplh Coates, surely one of the greatest fag-at-half-time merchants that the game has ever seen.
			<p />Upstairs a small crowd had gathered to witness The New Moon unleashing some new tunes in a bass/guitar/tabla formation to a rousing reception. Some classic introductions, too. Anton and Sue delivered a set heavy on the melody and easy on the rambling and then it was our turn. We played the first three tunes acoustic
			(making a bit of a hash of Charlie Barnard's sublime "Regrets of a Spacemen" by being altogether too heavy-handed) before switching on the BWT for a version of
			Land off Illuminate which really seemed to fly along rather nicely. "This," I told the small crowd, "is the rhythm I like." I even essayed some Barney Sumner style
			whoops during Shame About You. Frankly it sounded every bit as daft as when Barney does it. Note to self: pack it in, son. Rein yourself in.
			<p />
			The set was warmly received and - I think - reasonably well played. We had another beer, received handsome payment for our endeavours (thank you) and headed off
			into the freezing night, bent on return to NN1 so that Russ could finally enjoy a drink. No little confusion was induced a when we discovered that The Authorities
			had gone and CLOSED THE ROAD TO NORTHAMPTON. We set off on a not so magical mystery tour down tiny roads through dark, deserted woods, found our way somehow to
			Bicester, then sped the rest of the way home with ease, spotting the foxes raiding the Towcester Little Chef as we went by.

			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.blackcarrot.net)}
			<p />
			Since their last appearance at Masters of Budvar, Black Carrot have recorded three full albums, appeared on BBC Radio 3, added a
			vocalist and filled the theatre in their native Market Harborough with nerve-jangling improvisations around the stories of Edgar
			Allen Poe. Three ultra-talented musicians and a gaunt, imperious de-frocked thespian, the Carrot are demanding, intimidating,

			grainy as Faust, as instinctive and mercurial as Can, this is one far-out combo.
			<p />
			They support The Fall at the Charlotte in Leicester on Friday 24th March before heading to Northampton's most demented little

			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.mrs.pilgrimm.de)}

			Tonight she appears accompanied by her new live band, The Naked Nuns.

			<p />
			Entry to this far-out event is, as usual, entirely free.

			featuring
			<p />
			SATURATION POINT
			<p />
			Saturation Point are John Langley (drums), Joe
			Allen (bass) and Julian Poole (guitar).
			They come from Bristol and have an awesome
			pedigree. They were all in that ferociously dark band Strangelove during the
			nineties. This year they formed the rhythm section for the Blue Aeroplanes as
			they toured the UK on the EMI release of their Swagger Deluxe album. John and
			Julian have both also played with Witness, with whom they appeared on Jule
			Holland's Later.
			Joe has played with just about everybody from
			Rodney Allen to Groove Armada.
			<p />
			The Saturation Point sound is lush, loud and
			psychedelic. John was blunt:"It's Spacemen 3 without the
			singing."
			It's not far off the truth, though the band's
			simple melodic basis probably owes as much to Spiritualised and Slipstream as it
			does to the original psychedelic stormtroopers. This is beautiful music and it
			should be a treat. The band are also three of the loveliest men you could hope
			to meet. There is some disagreement among experts as to whether the band's name
			refers to the levels at which they play or the state of John Langley's
			liver.

			SYD MEATS
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.sydmeats.co.uk)}
			<p />
			A special guest appearance from Southampton's
			Leading Weird Bloke. From humble origins as songwriter-in-residence at BBC Radio
			Lincoln, Syd has gone on to become one of the most oddly beguiling solo
			performers around. An oasis of calm in tonight's proceedings, if not quite
			anything as mundane as sanity.
			<p />
			THE SPECIMEN EYEBALL
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.lemonrock.com/charlie)}
			<p />
			Mind-melting electric guitars and a tidal
			wave of tape delay shimmer all around the dark and devious songwriting of
			Charlie Barnard, backed up this time by a full band of his shadowy associates
			from the breezeblock jungle of Milton Keynes. Your brains will turn to jelly,
			seep out of your ears and dribble down your cheeks. And you will like
			it.
			<p />
			Usual terms and conditions
			apply
			free admission - bar till midnight -
			first act on about 9:00 o'clock
			Because we are staging three live acts
			this evening, no superstar DJ this month, but there will be a selection of tunes
			both current and classic to soothe the troubled soul and make it think about
			having another Budvar.

			Ray are a London-based quartet of great elegance and emotional power. They released their first album, First Light, on Rough Trade in 2005. Produced by John A. Rivers (Love & Rockets/Felt/JBC/The Specials), it is a lush, brooding piece of work with some great songs in the Tindersticks/Nick Cave mould; but it was only on seeing them live at the end of December that Masters of Budvar really came to understand quite how good Ray really are. Thanks largely to the inspired guitar playing of Mark Bradford, Ray really sprawl across a song in the best possible way, bringing to mind all the positive aspects of the early Verve, creating a fine setting for the Neil Bradford's rich, engaging singing. And if the lyrics don't cause you the occasional splutter of amused and embittered recognition, you're too young.
			Ray release their second album, Deep Blue Happy, on Pito Records on Monday 10th July.<br>
			<br>
			"Sublimely melodic" - The Guardian<br>
			"Almost flawless...Ray's first-time touch is breathtaking." - Q Magazine<br>
			"Loveliness galore for those lugubrious nights of the soul." - Rocksound<br>
			"We need bands like London foursome Ray more than ever." - The Fly<br>

			our special Guest from Los Angeles, California<br>
			THE BLACK WATCH<br>
			<br><br>
			John Andrew Frederick - singer, songwriter, guitarist, producer and polymath - has led The Black Watch through more than ten years and almost as many albums of sparkling, literate songwriting and shimmery psychedelic pop. Adored on LA's super-hep Silver Lake scene (yea, even as it moves down the road to Echo Park), The Black Watch have been compared to everybody from the Beatles (an undeniable influence) to My Bloody Valentine. <br>
			Last year, after an appearance at the International Pop Overthrow at Liverpool's Cavern Club, UK label Pink Hedgehog released the magnificent album The Hypnotising Sea, which also spawned the single Inner City Garden. With a new album, Tatterdemalian, in the can, John Andrew Frederick will be bringing new songs and old, all performed with the wit, grace and charm of a true original.<br><br>

			"Inner City Garden, the title track from their new EP, has my vote for best song of the summer." - LA Weekly<br><br>

			our Superstar DJ<br>
			PAT FISH<br>
			<br><br>
			All right, so it's a bit of a cop-out to do this, but - hey - these artists don't come for free, you know, and our man Fishy needs to limber up for the impending DJ death-match at Saturday's Battle Royale. <br>
			Fishy still wishes he'd played Rock Me Amadeus last year. Or lied about it, at least.<br>
			<br>
			Usual rules and regulations, people...

			Admission Free<br>
			Bar open until midnight<br>
			First band onstage 9:15pm<br>
			Friendly people, pretty lights, good vibrations<br>
			We hope to see you there.<br>

			<p />
			Euro-Romance of the very highest quality, with more than a touch of the great Jacques Brel.
			<p />
			Les Clochards, a laid-back quartet of stand-up bass, accordion, acoustic and drums,
			purvey a relaxing blend of Parisian cafe music, the odd nugget of Brecht/Weill and
			a couple of acoustic ballads that breathe the air of Henry Miller lounging around
			Parisian watering holes while writing dirty books. The singer was extraordinary, with
			a delivery which was one part Maurice Chevalier and the other part Elvis Presley.
			Singing in both French and English in a cool, dark baritone, he exuded confidence
			and smoothness. The very French-looking female accordionist, looking both blissful
			and slightly scared, filled the music with artful, authentic-sounding melodies and
			the overall effect was enchanting. Another strong gig, with Les Clochards emerging
			as a band of charm and originality.

			At next month's Masters of Budvar we shall be featuring:
			<p />
			THE POP GUN PLOT
			<p />
			Named after possibly the most fatuous assassination attempt ever, the Pop Gun Plot is the vehicle for the songwriting skills of
			Belfast-born Mairtin Burns. Inspired by the likes of the Monochrome Set and the Wedding Present, they play classic, melodic pop with a
			nervous edge and brilliant, witty lyrics that are reminiscent of Ray Davies. With a sterling album in the can, this show is part of the
			band's first UK tour.
			<p />
			BIG TIM SANSOM
			<p />
			One of Northampton's finest ever songwriters and wordsmiths returns to Masters of Budvar.
			<p />
			And, of course, we present your Superstar DJ,
			<p />
			JAMES ACASTER (The Wow Scenario)
			<p />
			It's all at Northampton Labour Club on Friday 1st September.
			Free admission, as ever, first artist on stge at 9:15pm, friendly people, pretty lights, bring all your pals to Masters of Budvar and show
			them all how cool you are.
			<p />
			The Popgun Plot hail from sunny West Belfast. The name comes from the failed assassination attempt on George III in 1794; the plotters were going
			to shoot the monarch in the neck with a poisoned dart from a popgun as he sat in the Royal Box of a theatre.
			<p />
			Frontman Martin Burns writes songs that reflect the humour of everyday life in the housing estates of West Belfast; joyriders, glue-sniffers,
			gambling addicts, valium addicts, alcoholics and promiscuous lemonade delivery men. And now that Martin works in the fancy pants world of the
			London media, he has turned to writing on such diverse subjects as PR girls, the mystifying preoccupation with designer labels, credit card debt,
			models with bad tempers, models with intellectual ability, Georgian Britain, the depletion of the rain forests, Claude Debussy, James McNeill
			Whistler and of course, death, or as he calls it ... the world's end.

			>From London<br>
			NAZCA PLAIN
			<p />
			Nazca Plain was formed by Charlie Barnard, Nick Mellon, David Gillespie
			and
			Robert Shields to experiment with music in colour. Sensuous and intense
			sounds drift through hypnotic instrumentals that lead into whimsical
			songs
			about sex with trees and Halloween.
			Charging headlong down the road mapped out by The Soft Machine, Acid
			Mothers
			Temple and Pink Floyd; Nazca Plain are one of the leading lights of
			British
			psychedelia.
			<p />

			>From the dark heart of NN1<br>
			SPITTLE RATTLE
			<p />
			Michael Holloway's long-running NN1 Delta Blues project grows ever
			stronger. Bone dry wit chronicling black despair, exquisite guitar music
			wedded to visceral disgust, the Spittle Rattle experience inspires
			recollections of Leonard Cohen, The Cure, Big Star and Scott Walker
			while retaining its own unique style.
			A must for those who find more to laugh about in Sam Beckett than Green
			Wing.
			<p />
			And, of course, your Superstar DJ for this month<br>
			${curt}
			<p />
			He's a local legend. He's an asset to the community and he has the
			paperwork to prove it.
			The leader of Barbed Choir, Strange Tales and Stranger Tractors, the
			evil mastermind behind the Short Wave Band, and a renowned solo artist
			in his own right, Curtis started as a professional DJ in Edinburgh back
			when punk rock ruled the Earth. Since then he has built up an
			astonishing collection of sonic essentials and eccentricities, so stand
			back and
			prepare to be amazed ((c) T. Walpole ) as he unleashes the beats. Didja
			get any on ya?
			<p />
			This all kicks off at about 9:00pm on Friday night.
			As usual, admission is free, the beer is cheap, the vibrations friendly,
			the lights pretty and the speeches short.
			We hope to see you there with all your pals.
			Masters of Budvar - as heard on BBC Radio One.
