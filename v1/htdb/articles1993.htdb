	forwarded message:<br>

<br>
	Wow, my first posting.  I'm the infamous (only to those who listen to KBVR<br>
	Corvallis) Jazz Butcher fiend DJ. I play him every week, usually using<br>
	Fertilizer as my background music for PSAs. Anyway, I heard this  song<br>
	last night, &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; obviously related to &quot;Grey Flannelette,&quot;<br>
	although I don't know which came first. The band was the Normals and if<br>
	anyone knows about them I'd like to know who ripped who off. JBC's version<br>
	is of course wholly better.<br>
	<br>
	Leah<br>
	partytime-&quot;it's better than a cold bath with Police Chief Daryl Gates&quot;<br>
	<kbd>
<br>
	<br>
	well, grey flannelette is the spin-off.<br>
	bath of bacon has several allusive lyrics:<br>
	grey flannelette -&gt; warm leatherette<br>
	zombie love -&gt; the zombies<br>
	velvets references in gloop jiving/jb theme<br>
	<br>
	probably others.  yeah, he has hung his laundry in his lyrics since<br>
	the beginning - not so much lately, though.  i appreciate *how* he<br>
	does it though.  its sort of like how kids completely miss the classical<br>
	and popular references in the old warner brothers cartoons, yet they still<br>
	hold up for all audiences.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Western Family arrives!
	<p>
	and they are sitting in front of me.<br>
	<br>
	i finally got a copy of the live JBC release entitled<br>
	Western Family: the Jazz Butcher conspiracy in America &amp; Canada 1992.<br>
	<br>
	the cover is a nice burnt red and yellow oval logo taken from<br>
	the &quot;matchbook cover of my favourite grocery in calgary&quot;, western family.<br>
	the inside has three photos.  one of a tea-cup ride at an amusement park,<br>
	the Highlander Hotel (tm) in calgary, and school busses sitting in<br>
	front of a naval destroyer.  that about covers the bases, i'd say.<br>
	the fold-out photo of the JBC shows them sitting on a ledge in front<br>
	of a big ship.   nick on the right is making a thinking-real-hard face,<br>
	pete is just screwing around with something that cant be read in front<br>
	of his face.  pat looks off into the distance and dooj is wearing the<br>
	blonde version of his hair.<br>
	<br>
	da tunes:<br>
	${icon_blank}	southern mark smith<br>
	${icon_blank}	shirley<br>
	${icon_blank}	sister death<br>
	${icon_blank}	still and all<br>
	${icon_blank}	pineapple tuesday<br>

	${icon_blank}	girl go<br>
	${icon_blank}	shes a yoyo<br>
	${icon_blank}	racheland<br>
	${icon_blank}	everbodys talkin (fred neil)<br>
	${icon_blank}	tugboat captain (galaxy 500)<br>
	${icon_blank}	over the rainbow (arlen/hamburg)<br>
	<br>
	pat told me that _mr odd_ was dropped due to time considerations.<br>
	come on.  14 songs!  that's the most in years.<br>
	<br>
	overall its pretty fairly what their set looked like last tour.<br>
	the sound?  rev botus fleming aka martin stebbing was able to do<br>
	wonders with my live tapes.  the bass is solid on everything, and i got<br>
	the live/board mix mostly ok (but sure would like to try again with<br>
	better equipment!).  i only had a quick scan, but i would say<br>
	that i am pleased with about 2/3 of the quality (in sound).  your milage<br>
	may vary.  the adlib from chicago, _snow white hair_ is a standout,<br>
	and is almost a spacemen 3 tune.<br>
	<br>
	the absolute best part...  continuing the &quot;groove&quot; notes from LP days,<br>
	right around the hole in the CD it says simply: &quot;the floor was slightly wet&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	the inside story (re-printed from the jbc-list archives):<br>
	&gt; pete's boring dream #3<br>
	&gt; &quot;i just walked into the bath after someone had just showered<br>
	&gt; and looked at the floor and thought 'its SLIGHTLY wet'.....<br>
	&gt; now, see if it had been SOPPING wet it might have been interesting.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	our own deerkiller is in the &quot;thanks and respect&quot; column.<br>
	(though he has been notably absent here)<br>
	(wait.. so has everyone else.. :-)<br>

	Dear David,<br>
	<br>
	I wouldn't believe that bunch of pissheads if my life depended on it!<br>
	Actually, Nikki isn't a real DRINKER anymore, as a matter of fact he's a<br>
	reformed character.  Dave, on the other hand is a TOTAL drunken slob -<br>
	decent bloke but nevertheless when his dole cheque arrives it is spent on<br>
	the alcohol...<br>
	<br>
	Truth is, I only know of Pat cos Dave introduced me at a gig they did together<br>
	some while back.  Don't really talk to Dave about his music associates.<br>
	Just someone I go to the pub with! I suppose I loose the bet... I always<br>
	wondered howcome Nikki was so chummy with the likes of Nick Cave, Pete Buck,<br>
	Robyn Hitchcock, etc.<br>
	<br>
	Sure, sign me up for the mailing list!  I run a fanzine over here in England<br>
	and if you like I can print the latest on the jazz butcher in it.. (it's<br>
	called WAXSTREET DIVE).<br>
	<br>
	Oh yeah!  I found out about you via ftp cs.uwp.edu.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks a lot<br>

	<br>
	Well, I have heard of them...  I was pretty into a couple of their albums<br>
	a while back, but i haven't heard much of their new stuff.  They're cool,<br>
	sorta dylan-stones esque with sometimes hard to handle dissonance, but,<br>
	as a friend of mine once said, &quot;they have all the good feel of the jbc.&quot;<br>
	or something like that.<br>
	<br>
	I still prefer the jbc.<br>
	<br>
	Speaking of the jbc, sort of, I just got hold of a copy of an old<br>
	&quot;Modern Lovers&quot; album.  They're the band that originally did roadrunner.<br>
	A friend of mine claims he can see butch stealng a lot of mannerisms<br>
	or tidbits (you know) from this guy (I forget his name).<br>
	${icon_blank} Anyone else heard it?  It's from 1973...<br>

	<p>
	I just joined the list, so I thought I'd introduce myself...<br>
	<br>
	I can't wait for the JBC to tour again!  I first heard of them from a<br>
	newspaper article - they were playing in a local club (called &quot;Zaphod<br>
	Beeblebrox&quot;:) There was a $5 entry fee... anyhow in the end I very<br>
	stupidly decided not to go *because I thought I might not like them*.<br>
	Several months later in HMV I listened to a track or two from Condition<br>
	Blue and liked it... then started to collect albums.  I still can't<br>
	believe I didn't go to that concert!!!! :(<br>
	<br>
	Now I'm a really big fan... I've heard that this list is slow but I<br>
	will try to make it otherwise - prepare for lots of mail! :)  At<br>
	very least, we should try and figure out the lyrics to songs...<br>
	I wish they'd stick the lyrics in the liner notes. :(<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> Rick.G.Karr@gagme.chi.il.us (Rick G. Karr)
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Apocrypha. . . .
	<p>
	Bits of probing questioning for y'all:<br>
	<br>
	1) Though this may not be the appropriate forum, I can't think of a better<br>
	${icon_blank}	place to ask, especially since there's no<br>
	${icon_blank}	max-list@pasture.ecn.purdue.edu, and no alt.max.eider. So here it<br>
	${icon_blank}	is: What's become of our Maximillian Theodore, where is he now<br>
	${icon_blank}	(&quot;Living in East Ham, writing ad slogans for bog roll,&quot; was the<br>
	${icon_blank}	last answer I heard from Pat.), and is he still playing?<br>
	${icon_blank}   Related topic: Is the band currently barnstorming the Midwest under the<br>
	${icon_blank}	moniker &quot;The Best Kissers In The World&quot; at all indebted to Max?<br>
	<br>
	2) Does anybody know if &quot;Starpoint Studios in Beautiful Downtown Clapham&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	(From the opening cut of _Bath_In_Bacon_, my copy of which was<br>
	${icon_blank}	sadly abandoned in said area of London when I was forced to flee<br>
	${icon_blank}	H.M. Immigration Officers some years ago) is the same as &quot;ReMaximum&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	studios there?<br>
	${icon_blank}   I suppose this question is for the hard-core only.<br>
	<br>
	3) Is it true that Pat, while studying classics at Oxford, frequently used<br>
	${icon_blank}	to busk at sunrise in his college Quad? And which college was it?<br>
	<br>
	Curiously,<br>
	<br>
	Rick G. Karr<br>
	<br>
	P.S. Seen posted on a chalkboard in the entrance to Leona's, a friendly<br>
	${icon_blank}   Chicago Italian eatery:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	We'll be your lunch (sic)<br>
	${icon_blank}	We'll be you dinner<br>
	${icon_blank}	You won't go hungry<br>
	${icon_blank}	You won't grow thinner<br>
	${icon_blank}	To see you starvin. . . .<br>

	Y'all know the rest. . . .<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> And while I'm at it. . . .
	<p>
	Two more things for y'all to gnosh:<br>
	<br>
	1) There is (was?) a mag here in Chi called _Pure_ that not only seemed<br>
	${icon_blank}	to have been run by JBC-heads (can we think of a better name for<br>
	${icon_blank}	ourselves?), but featured lotsa JBC-related material, including<br>
	${icon_blank}	a tip on when Pat'll be in town to record with the Rev. Botus W.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Fleming, and an article by Pat hisself. Ennybody know these<br>
	${icon_blank}	people?<br>
	<br>
	2) More serious: I'm obsessed with the Fall. In fact, one of the great short-<br>
	${icon_blank}	comings of my current e-mail server is its inability to direct my mail<br>
	${icon_blank}	to fall-list at E.S.A. somewhere in the Netherlands. Regardless,<br>
	${icon_blank}	JBC-Fall coincidences never fail to impress. Start with their mutual<br>
	${icon_blank}	use of Mr Legras' artwork. Then go back to, uhn, 1985, is it? <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}		&quot;McGinty thought he could fool the Fall<br>
	${icon_blank}		 with his imitation speeds<br>
	${icon_blank}		 but he could not know the psychic nose. . . .&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}			(--&quot;Pat-Trip Dispenser,&quot; M.E. Smith, et al)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Pat? Trip dispenser? Surely he couldn't mean. . . ? I asked Pat<br>
	${icon_blank}	last time he was in town: &quot;Is 'Pat-Trip Dispenser' about you?&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}   The cryptic response: &quot;Well, Smith does shout 'McGinty!' at the end. And<br>
	${icon_blank}	'Southern Mark Smith' was released the week before.&quot; (Or was it<br>
	${icon_blank}	the week after? I can't remember.)<br>
	${icon_blank}   So: What's this &quot;McGinty&quot; stuff? Was this two bands slaggign each other<br>
	${icon_blank}	off on vinyl? Was Pat bonking Brixie? (After all, we all know how <br>
	${icon_blank}	much he likes American women.) Were he and Smith just havin' fun?<br>

	-&gt; Bits of probing questioning for y'all:<br>
	<br>
	-&gt; 1)<br>
	-&gt; 	What's become of our Maximillian Theodore, where is he now<br>
	-&gt; 	(&quot;Living in East Ham, writing ad slogans for bog roll,&quot; was the<br>
	-&gt; 	last answer I heard from Pat.), and is he still playing?<br>
	<br>
	Check out the last two David J. albums.  His presence is at the least,<br>
	noteworthy.  I like his work better on &quot;Songs...Season&quot; than on UrbUrb.<br>
	<br>
	I saw them about two years ago (David, Jones, Max) playing at the Roxy<br>
	in Hollywood.  I would assume that if David J tours again for this album<br>
	that max will join him.<br>
	${icon_blank}   <br>
	-&gt; Related topic: Is the band currently barnstorming the Midwest under the<br>
	-&gt; 	moniker &quot;The Best Kissers In The World&quot; at all indebted to Max?<br>
	<br>
	I have wondered this as well.  Especially since at least a year ago there<br>
	was a twin bill on dollar night at the local venue (The Catalyst) of<br>
	The Best Kissers in the World along with The Butchers.<br>
	<br>
	Mere coincidence?  I think not.  sadly, I did not attend that concert, so<br>
	I never found out.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Mr Fish plays London (brief report)
	<p>
	To confirm what joe said, the gig was held in a truly tiny venue, crammed with<br>
	an audience of about 50 devotees. Pat was completely unaccompanied, just<br>
	him, his guitar, and what is evidently his fave effects pedal.<br>
	<br>
	Pat was wandering around the bar during the support acts, muttering &quot;Christ, <br>
	I'm nervous. I haven't done this in years.&quot; Once he got on stage <br>
	though, he seemed pretty relaxed, and was full of sarcastic comments.<br>
	He opened up with Girl Go, followed by lots of Condition Blue-esque<br>
	new stuff. &quot;Stop whining and play something cheerful, you miserable git,&quot; he<br>
	chided himself between songs. <br>
	<br>
	And cheerful things were indeed played. As well as <br>
	the Cult of the Basement stuff joe mentioned, there was a *brilliant* heartfelt<br>
	version of Chickentown (the evening was full of Northampton references). She's<br>
	on Drugs was also great, despite Pat's protestations &quot;You're a bunch of soppies<br>
	aren't you? There are thousands of bands can play you stuff like that, with<br>
	drums and everything.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Altogether the set lasted about 1hr 20mins, and I captured (nearly) all<br>
	of it in glorious digital sound (though on the quieter, new numbers, there's<br>
	a bit of background chatter going on in the bar - (shock horror))<br>
	<br>
	I spoke to Pat (very) briefly, and asked about plans for the States this<br>
	year. He says that if all goes according to plan  he'll be over in the fall.<br>
	He also mentioned between songs that he'll be at the Edinburgh festival <br>
	this year (OK Jim?), but he was speaking French at the time so I<br>
	didn't really pick up the details too well.<br>
	<br>
	Full playing order when I've worked it out.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Revisionism
	<p>
	Sebastian Hagedorn writes:<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; Finally, probably this has been discussed over and over but don't<br>
	&gt; you think that it has never been the same since Max Eider left?<br>
	&gt; With the more recent albums I always like a few songs, but not as much<br>
	&gt; as I liked &quot;Scandal in Bohemia&quot; etc.<br>
	&gt; <br>
	<br>
	Perhaps it has, but not since I've been on the list. Consequently, I'd<br>
	like to take a shot, especially in light of what I consider to be<br>
	an odd schism regarding &quot;post-Max revisionism&quot; among JBC fans.<br>
	<br>
	First, a little background on my own opinion, so everyone knows my<br>
	prejudices up front: Like many of you, I held the belief for a long<br>
	time that _Distressed_Gentlefolk_ was the zenith of the _original_<br>
	JBC (I know there were lineup changes in there, but the main strength<br>
	of the band seemed to me to be the interplay between Max and Pat). After<br>
	the split, I was thoroughly impressed by _The_Best_Kisser_. . ., which<br>
	seemed to retain the melancholy ambience of _D_G_ while proving that Max<br>
	was a solid songwriter, lyricist (&quot;A hundred years have hardly left a<br>
	trace/I can't believe what twenty-eight/Have done to mine&quot;), arranger,<br>
	and a vocalist with a unique, though limited style. _Fishcotheque_ (Is it<br>
	still open under the arches at Victoria, I wonder?) struck me, on the <br>
	other hand, as a sloppy, thin-sounding parade of second-rate Pat songs.<br>
	<br>
	This analysis was hotly disputed by my JBC-listening friends at the time<br>
	(A few members of this list among them). To them, _T_B_K_I_T_W_ was &quot;a<br>
	sell out,&quot; &quot;overproduced,&quot; etc., while _Fishcotheque_ was &quot;honest&quot; and<br>
	the like. I know this is typical indie aesthetic; I suffer from it myself <br>
	sometimes. But it had always seemed to me that Pat was uncomfortable<br>
	workingf in the low-fi, cut it and release it world of indie land. He<br>
	_wanted_ to spend hours in the studio, creating achingly beautiful sound-<br>
	scapes.<br>
	<br>
	I think _Condition_Blue_ and, more importantly, _Cult_Of_The_Basement_<br>
	bear that out. I also think _C_O_T_B_ surpasses _D_G_ in most respects <br>
	(lousy mastering notwithstanding. An aside on that front: Mr. Whittemore -- <br>
	do you think Mr. Stebbing would allow us to copy his safety DAT of _Cult_ to <br>
	an FTP site? Although I've never heard it, it sounds as though it's worth <br>
	hearing!)<br>
	<br>
	So on to revisionism, as I realize I've rambled far longer than I should've:<br>
	Now, most JBC fans seem to have demoted _Fishcotheque_ from the landmark<br>
	status they once accorded it, and promoted their respect for Max's LP.<br>
	<br>
	The questions are: (1) Is this true, or am I misinterpreting things, reading<br>
	things into people's comments? (2) If it is true, how does this revision<br>
	relate to the &quot;Is Pat's with-Max output inevitably better&quot; question? (3) Does<br>
	Max lose points for not following up? (4) Why do so many people in this<br>
	group seem to write off more &quot;serious&quot; post-Max works like _Cult_? What am<br>
	I missing (or what am I seeing that others aren't?)<br>

	<p>
	I have always  thought that the best 2 records Pat has done are Gentlefolk<br>
	and Fishcoteque.  They couldn't be more different records, but they both<br>
	showed Pat maturing as a song writer.  I'm speaking of course of my perception<br>
	at the time of their release.  We are now very familiar with the &quot;mature&quot;<br>
	(more like morose) Pat Fish of the last 2 records.  I agree with David Wittmore<br>
	that the early records are not as interesting.  I can't remember the last time<br>
	I gave Scandal or Bath a spin.  But I find that I'm always in the mood for<br>
	fishcoteque.  I also have a soft spot for Best Kisser...  I thought it was<br>
	a great record when it came out and I still think so.  I would not compare it<br>
	to any JB records.  To me, it's a record by a different band.<br>

	<p>
	To tell you the truth, it was years before i spoke of this album with anything<br>
	but disgust.  I too considered DG the pinnacle of the fish's work.  Lately<br>
	I have found myself listening to all of the albums about equally, but<br>
	considering i've heard D_G hundreds of times and I am still listening<br>
	to it as often as I<br>
	do C_o_t_B or B_P_S_P, which i've heard dozens rather than hundereds of times,<br>
	i would take that as a testament to how completely D_G has wedged itself into<br>
	my musical-taste standards....<br>
	<br>
	B_K_i_t_W was a successful, I think, but I do wish that max had followed it<br>
	up with something besides his sexy licks on david j.'s work.<br>

	The latest news is that the new Jazz Butcher album is due out on<br>
	Monday (in the UK at least).<br>
	<br>
	Two things prevent me from getting too excited:<br>
	<br>
	(1) Creation are quite often two or three weeks over-<br>
	${icon_blank}    optimistic with 'trivial' releases (e.g. &quot;Western Family&quot;,<br>
	${icon_blank}    Black Eg, anything by teeny bands like The Times, etc. etc.)<br>
	<br>
	(2) The actual piece said &quot;...follow up to the acclaimed 'Western<br>
	${icon_blank}    Family'.&quot; which makes me think that it is tinged with irony. :*)<br>

	<br>
	&gt;did you see them on the 92tour?<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   of all the jazz butcher shows i've seen, 1992 made 4, i thought that the most<br>

	including angels, big saturday, pinapple tuesday, falling in love, looking for<br>
	lot 49, human jungle, girlfriend, and many more jbc classics.  <br>
	${icon_blank}  the opening band, the black watch, was outstanding.  the blue aeroplanes <br>
	opened the year before, while i like their music, i must admit a slight <br>
	irritation over their 'dancer'.  they employ a band member to dance to the<br>
	music, that's all he does, no tamborine, no nothing, just dancing.<br>
	he kept spraying sweat all over the first few rows of people, i don't need <br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Broiled Fish
	<p>
	interrupting pat's dinner on satday proved a decent thing.<br>
	with cats crawling over him, he mentioned:<br>
	<br>
	o	recently, in lisbon, pat played with the blue aeroplanes.<br>
	${icon_blank}	playing were 3 JBC members - paul, ridney, and pat.<br>
	${icon_blank}	due to gerard's (the BA's singer) imagined JBMutany,<br>
	${icon_blank}	the blue aeoplanes have *yet* again broken up.<br>
	o	Yo-Yo is getting tons of airplay in the states, apparently<br>
	${icon_blank}	on mainstream stations.  he said that Yo-Yo alone tops<br>
	${icon_blank}	all others combined in worldwide play.<br>
	o	for those wondering about back catalogue re-issue...<br>
	${icon_blank}	bitch to Fire Records.  they own it.  Creation *would* put it<br>
	${icon_blank}	out, but cannot due to boring business reasons.<br>
	o	earlier this year, pat was invited to a &quot;Cruise on Lake Ontario<br>
	${icon_blank}	with Billy Ray Cyrus&quot; by polygram records in canada.<br>
	${icon_blank}	while billy ray himself never showed up, pat will now have<br>
	${icon_blank}	no bad-mouthing of the man, because of all the cyrus-paid<br>
	${icon_blank}	drinks provided.  he enjoyed line dancing.<br>
	o	a french group has asked pat to remix a song he claims<br>
	${icon_blank}	to be &quot;I will survive&quot; in french.  the brothers are intrigued.<br>
	o	he attended the Velvet Underground show at wembley with David J.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Luna opened.   he had just come from the studio where he and<br>
	${icon_blank}	Sonic had done a version of Luna's song Indian Summer.  Luna<br>
	${icon_blank}	were playing that song when the got to wembley.  pat says<br>
	${icon_blank}	that that day was one of the most perfect days of his life.<br>
	o	Mean Fiddler.  he was scared, and un-sure of how it would go over.<br>
	${icon_blank}	it had been awhile since he had performed totally alone.<br>
	${icon_blank}	he will be doing another Mean Fiddler gig in september.<br>
	o	the US distributor of the next album (yes, out monday uk-side)<br>
	${icon_blank}	will be by Tri Star, the sony people.  there just might be<br>
	${icon_blank}	hope for real exposure *finally*.<br>
	o	touring...  portugal is next.  probably not a US tour until<br>
	${icon_blank}	at least november (oh well).<br>
	<br>
	forthcoming: a care package with rebuttals to jbc-list Condition Blue bashing.<br>

	I picked up &quot;Waiting for the love bus&quot; this lunchtime from Avalanche<br>
	Records. I had a hard time convincing them that the product did actually<br>
	exist (&quot;But he's only just released a live album&quot;), but once they<br>
	relented it was ordered and arrived in 48hours.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, it's got quite a nice picture of penguins on a frosted glass<br>
	chess board on the front and rear of the CD box, and inside there's a<br>
	predictable (but naughty) picture by Pascal Legras. Also inside there's<br>
	credits, no lyrics, a picture of a bloke sitting on an upturned chair on<br>
	a unicycle wearing a hat and some teeny but cryptic heiroglyphics. <br>
	Here's the tracklisting:<br>
	<br>
	rosemary davis world of sound<br>
	bakersfield<br>
	kids in the mall / kaliningrad<br>
	whaddya?<br>
	sweetwater<br>
	ghosts<br>
	baltic<br>
	killed out<br>
	ben<br>
	penguins<br>
	president chang<br>
	angel station<br>
	rosemary davis world of sound (reprise)<br>
	<br>
	The whole lot clocks in at almost exactly one hour.<br>
	<br>
	The sleeve implies that the jbc on this recording consist only of pat<br>
	fish and richard formby. it's produced by richard formby as well (more<br>
	on that later). Other musicians credited are: dooj, bass; nick burson,<br>
	drums and peter crouch, guitars &amp; voice.<br>
	<br>
	The production is actually quite &quot;raw&quot;, almost like they set up a live<br>
	PA in the recording studio at times. Whether this is intentional or just<br>
	shoddy mastering like what apparently happened to `Western Family' is<br>
	<br>
	anyone's guess. IMHO, it doesn't really suit some of the material, which<br>
	- very occasionally - is more like Spacemen 3 than even Spacemen 3 are.<br>
	That kind of spaced-out lush drippy stuff deserves a clean, sparse<br>
	production.<br>
	<br>
	I will restrain saying what I actually think of the new material on the<br>
	basis that nobody else will have any idea what I am talking about at the<br>
	moment. Unless you're all sitting there listening to the damn thing<br>
	anyway and I'm telling you what you already know, of course. When is it<br>
	released in the US?<br>

	<p>
	muchos danke for your report, ed.<br>
	<br>
	i special ordered it here this week.<br>
	they may get around to doing something about getting it by 1994.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; From: edwardc@aisb.ed.ac.uk<br>
	&gt; When in posession of the facts I'll take issue with you (and the rest of<br>
	&gt; the world bar one by the look of things) concerning Condition Blue.<br>
	<br>
	bar none now...<br>
	when i spoke with pat last weekend, he commented on a jbc-list condensation i<br>
	had sent him, and he had words in particular for you.  something about<br>
	your jbc clipping collection not being very complete.<br>
	i *think* he may just have taken offense to your k d lang photo comment :-)<br>
	<br>
	at any rate, the jbc-populous has irrited him enough into a<br>
	(forthcoming) direct response, so i see this all as a positive thing.<br>
	<br>
	the new thing...  i would like to know what the general mood<br>
	is these days.  this spring, he promised a &quot;sarcastic&quot; record.<br>
	well, his previous promise of a &quot;cynical&quot; record turned into condition blue,<br>
	whose cynacism is buried under lushness, so i am doubting exactly how<br>
	sarcastic the guy can get.<br>

	&gt; i *think* he may just have taken offense to your k d lang photo comment :-)<br>
	<br>
	I have independent witnesses! Well OK, some bloke looked over my<br>
	shoulder and said &quot;Is that kd lang?&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; the new thing...  i would like to know what the general mood<br>
	&gt; is these days.<br>
	<br>
	muscially, it varies pretty much as we'd expect from the quiet lush stuff<br>
	(&quot;rd world of sound&quot;) to the relatively rockin' (&quot;killed out&quot;) just as<br>
	CotB flits between &quot;Girl Go&quot; and &quot;Room 109&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	I don't think it's sarcastic at all. &quot;penguins&quot; is quite rude about<br>
	penguins but I'm not a penguin so I don't take offence. It's less<br>
	sarcastic than CondBlue is cynical (which CB is a bit).<br>
	<br>
	I reckon it's a damn cheerful record, actually. whaddya?, sweetwater and<br>
	ghosts are all blissfully optimistic in one way or another and they bouy<br>
	the rest of the album up. Yea, even unto the crap song.<br>
	<br>
	ed<br>
	<br>
	Admit it, though, it does make him look a *bit* like kd lang....<br>

	superb.<br>
	<br>
	with exactly 3 exceptions:<br>
	bakersfield, killed out, and president chang, which<br>
	(to me) are all the panic in room 109 thing.<br>
	<br>
	unlike the last few &quot;bring on the geetar player&quot; albums,<br>
	the love bus seats 4, plus richard.  the players obviously<br>
	are comfortable together, and the solos when they happen<br>
	are a refreshing addition.<br>
	production is sparce and clean - nice work richard.<br>
	the drums and bass for the most part, are just there.<br>
	lots of brushes instead of full-out pounded percussion,<br>
	and they seem to have stolen nick's toms.<br>
	this is an album to showcase the vocalist who is swimming<br>
	in just one little bowl too many of 'verb.<br>
	<br>
	pat has been mentioning affection for the beach boy's<br>
	brian wilson, and the affection is *almost* there in mood,<br>
	although it is filtered.  a couple tunes have 4 and 5 part<br>
	harmonies, but they are used darkly.<br>
	<br>
	notes:<br>
	${icon_blank}	rosemary davis world of sound<br>
	${icon_blank}		suburban observation with changes i didnt expect.<br>
	${icon_blank}	whaddya?<br>
	${icon_blank}		probably the single.  to-the-point love song.<br>
	${icon_blank}		perfect organ parts.<br>
	${icon_blank}	sweetwater<br>
	${icon_blank}		up-tempo.  an un-expected chorus.  suspicous 2nd verse.<br>
	${icon_blank}	ghosts<br>
	${icon_blank}		another singles candidate.  with a catchy my bloody<br>
	${icon_blank}		valentine sample and good sing-along chorus.<br>
	${icon_blank}	killed out<br>
	${icon_blank}		the bicycle kid grows up - rocker.<br>
	${icon_blank}	penguins<br>
	${icon_blank}		or rather, pineapple penguins.  same chord progression<br>
	${icon_blank}		as pineapple tuesday, but with lyrics suited to much<br>
	${icon_blank}		earlier albums.  this one will be fun live.<br>
	${icon_blank}	president chang<br>
	${icon_blank}		clinton, really.  but why?<br>
	${icon_blank}	angel station<br>
	${icon_blank}		perhaps the last &quot;come back&quot; tune?<br>
	${icon_blank}	rosemary davis world of sound (reprise)<br>
	${icon_blank}		spacemen 3 version of the opener.<br>
	<br>
	at the first listen, i was unprepared for the apparent change in overall mood.<br>
	love bus is closer to fishcotheque than to condition blue in attitude,<br>
	even though keyboard fills are present.<br>
	the songwriting is there.  lets see what Sony/US makes of it...<br>

	<p>
	&gt; superb.<br>
	<br>
	maybe. certainly the closest to superb he's been for a long time.<br>
	<br>
	I (too) was impressed by the fact that the album wasn't swimming<br>
	with guest musicians (like Cond Blue was). That is, it was a band<br>
	recording this rather than Pat in the studio with everyone he knew<br>
	who could play an instrument.... and then some.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; with exactly 3 exceptions:<br>
	&gt; bakersfield, killed out, and president chang, which<br>
	&gt; (to me) are all the panic in room 109 thing.<br>
	<br>
	my three exceptions are: kids in the mall / kaliningrad, president<br>
	chang and *maybe* baltic<br>
	<br>
	the first two just wash right over me. I listen to both of them<br>
	wondering when the next song is going to start. Baltic's OK,<br>
	actually, but it's a real downer for some reason.<br>
	<br>
	three notes: <br>
	<br>
	&gt; whaddya?<br>
	I'm in love with that &quot;pingggg&quot; noise. It's hard to sing a sound<br>
	effect to yourself all day but, well, I'm trying.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; rosemary davis world of sound <br>
	&gt; angel station <br>
	<br>
	Very spacemenny...  the first line of &quot;angel station&quot; sounds like a<br>
	straight lift off-of a track whose name i can't remember on 'Playing<br>
	with Fire', doesn't it?<br>
	<br>
	If &quot;angel station&quot; is a come back tune, which is likely (!) then<br>
	it's a zillion times better than the come back album. They're<br>
	splendid songs, both.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; ben<br>
	any clue what the hell this is about?<br>
	<br>
	&gt; at the first listen, i was unprepared for the apparent change in<br>
	&gt; overall mood.<br>
	<br>
	it's hardly &quot;sarcastic&quot; though, is it? I dunno if it has a fixed<br>
	kind of mood. Like CondBlue was, for better or for worse, an kinda<br>
	one-track emotional record. (*) WFTLB is a disparate collection of<br>
	moods, including the aforementioned &quot;come back&quot; track. At least some<br>
	of it's *cheerful* at last.<br>
	<br>
	In a charitable mood, I'd say that this is a welcome return to form<br>
	with, it has to be said, the good bits of the last couple'o'albums<br>
	as well... so better than ever, perhaps? Uncharitably, it's as good<br>
	as I could possibly expect.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; navels arent naughty!<br>
	<br>
	Scots puritanical upbringing. I didn't know navels existed until I<br>
	was 21 and allowed to visit the National Gallery to have a Rubens<br>
	explained to me.<br>
	<br>
	ed.<br>
	<br>
	(*) Condition Blue complaint moved out of main text for reasons of<br>
	${icon_blank}    repetition and relevance. This is my last word on the subject<br>
	${icon_blank}    for... oooh... a week or so.<br>
	<br>
	Of course we don't blame Pat for making Condition Blue like he did<br>
	or when he did. Hell's teeth, I'd probably do the same. The question<br>
	is, though, whether cathartic emotional snarly wall climbing records<br>
	are best released to the general public or used in a final poetic<br>
	gesture of defiance and snipped into little pieces and thrown into a<br>
	river. I'm on the &quot;snip into little pieces&quot; ticket, as you may have<br>
	guessed.<br>

	Hello! My name is Paul, and I'm new to the JBC list. I was first<br>
	introduced to JBC back in 1986 when I d.j'd in college. I stopped listening<br>
	to them for awhile (basically after Max Eider split), and then decided to<br>
	buy &quot;Big Plant, Scary Planet&quot; on impulse. I enjoyed it, and then went and<br>
	bought &quot;Condition Blue&quot; shortly thereafter.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  My favorite is &quot;She's On Drugs&quot;, followed closely by &quot;She's A Yo-Yo&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Are any of their early recordings available on cd? If so, anyone know<br>
	where I can buy them?<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> David A Whittemore &lt;del@pasture.ecn.purdue.edu&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC-list Introduction
	<p>
	&gt; Question 1:<br>
	&gt; What's the deal with the butcher's catalog?  I'm assuming they're all <br>
	&gt; out-of-print since it's rare to find anything pre-Fishcotheque.  I once heard <br>
	&gt; that Sky Records was going to pick them up, but I also heard that Pat wasn't <br>
	&gt; all-over the idea of having them re-released.<br>
	<br>
	well, at least from the jbc-list, the interest is there.<br>
	fire records owns the back catalogue, convince them to re-release.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Question 2:<br>
	&gt; What are the &quot;Black Eg&quot; and &quot;Western Family&quot; all about. Are they just EPs, <br>
	&gt; re-mixes, etc.?  Do they contain any new material?<br>
	<br>
	western family is a live disc from the 92north american tour.<br>
	it has some worthwhile moments.  there are 4 tunes not available<br>
	elsewhere, 3 of them covers.<br>
	<br>
	black eg...  well, it is an album, and it is all new material..<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Question 3:<br>
	&gt; Is there a new studio album in the works?<br>
	<br>
	yup.  &quot;Waiting for the love bus&quot; on creation has been out for a month or so.<br>
	it is a nice cross of distressed gentlefolk and fishcotheque, i think.<br>
	and it could be massive.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; And is the Butch still w/Sky records?<br>
	<br>
	nope.  nice people, but they dont know how to promote!<br>
	pat goes mainstream with EPIC for the new album.<br>
	lets hope there can finally be some decent promotion ferghodsake.<br>

	but I did tape the 91X show.  I'll have a set list for you<br>
	tomorrow but he played a few solo accoustic live numbers<br>
	and they played a few album cuts.  Also on the 91X show was<br>
	Guy Chadwick from the House of Love.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  If Pat was on KCRW also, he probably played more as they<br>

	work something out.<br>

	<p>
	&gt;  Dierdra O'Donahue does a show in Santa Monica on the PBS <br>
	&gt; station KCRW called SNAP.  She also does a show on 91X in<br>
	&gt; San Diego called Snap Judgements.<br>
	<br>
	He's done stuff for her show before. On the Creation<br>
	compliation &quot;Pensioners on Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;American Pensioners<br>
	on Ecstasy&quot; (sp?) which contain some fine rare/unreleased<br>
	Creation oddities, there are a couple of tracks recorded for<br>
	Diedrie O'Donahue: Mr Odd on PoE and Girl Go on APoE (or was<br>
	it &quot;She's on Drugs&quot;? I don't know).<br>
	<br>
	A supplementary question to make this worth sending is whether<br>
	anyone has any idea of what a list of Pat's production credits<br>
	might be. I know he produced the 1st (and only?) 13 Frightened<br>
	Girls EP (which is v.good, incidentally).<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, I picked up a 12&quot; by a band called &quot;Love Kittens&quot; for<br>
	only 49p in Tower Records, Glasgow recently and I have since<br>
	had a vague feeling that Pat has produced material for them as<br>
	well. Any clues about this, anyone?<br>

	<p>
	Hi everyone.<br>
	<br>
	After listening to the new one for a month or so, I thought it was<br>
	about time I had some opinion, not that it's necessary.<br>
	<br>
	Rosemary Davis World of Sound<br>
	${icon_blank}	I really don't like this song but I can't say why.<br>
	<br>
	Bakersfield<br>
	${icon_blank}	Fun song.  It's starting to grow on me.<br>
	<br>
	Kids in the Mall/Kaliningrad<br>
	${icon_blank}	Great.<br>
	<br>
	Whaddya?<br>
	${icon_blank}	Ditto.  Reminds me a little of Big Saturday.<br>
	<br>
	SweetWater<br>
	${icon_blank}	Another great one.  Destined to become an Indie hit?<br>
	<br>
	Ghosts<br>
	${icon_blank}	Also great, albeit very light.<br>
	<br>
	Baltic<br>
	${icon_blank}	Pat's poetic-Eastern-European-Count-side.  Is it true he's<br>
	${icon_blank}	replacing Tom Cruise?  A really good song.<br>
	<br>
	Killed Out<br>
	${icon_blank}	Sounds like something off Big World...  Ok.<br>
	<br>
	Ben<br>
	${icon_blank}	Great song.  I have ne idea what this is about.<br>
	<br>
	Penguins<br>
	${icon_blank}	cute.   Doesn't do much for me.<br>
	<br>
	President Chang<br>
	${icon_blank}	Truly aweful, and racist as well.  This is where it starts to<br>
	${icon_blank}	fall apart for me.<br>
	<br>
	Angel Station<br>
	${icon_blank}	Very drony and boring.  Western Family fare.<br>
	${icon_blank}  <br>
	Rosemary Davis World of Sound (Reprise)<br>
	${icon_blank}	Don't get it.  Why is this here?<br>
	<br>
	Overall,  I really like this record.  I think it's much better Than CB.<br>
	The overall mood of the record is totally different from CB or CotB.<br>
	<br>
	Another small tidbit:  I was in the UK last week (while Pat was in San <br>
	Diego of all places).  In a quick survey of record stores in SoHo,  only<br>
	1 had the new record.  What's going on with Creation's promotion dept.?<br>
	Or could it be that it's so popular they're having a hard time keeping<br>
	it in stock?<br>
	<br>
	Correct me if I'm wrong.  But I don't think Snap is on KCRW anymore(the <br>
	station has gone downhill).  It's been replaced by &quot;Evening Becomes<br>
	Eclectic&quot; (gag).<br>
	<br>
	That's all.<br>
	<br>

	First of all, I have to say that I love used record stores.  Some crazy folks<br>
	(no, not crazy, stupid!) keep selling off their old JBC vinyls that I <br>
	would never have found otherwise, and they're cheap to boot!  I managed <br>
	to collect the first three albums, the Hamburg recording, and Conspiracy, <br>
	all at nice cheap prices, and finally got to listen to them at the end of <br>
	the summer since I don't have a record player but my parents do.  Enough <br>
	blather... time for some more specific blather, I suppose<br>
	<br>
	Bath of Bacon - the first side almost put me to sleep.  &quot;Gloop Jiving Jazz<br>
	Butcher Theme&quot; didn't impress, and neither did the original Partytime.  I<br>
	much prefer the version on Bloody Nonsense - where's it from?  Was it<br>
	re-recorded?<br>
	${icon_blank}   The second side is so much better!  Zombie Love is sicko, Grey Flanellette<br>
	is great!  I could never figure out the lyrics for it on Spooky...  Does anyone<br>
	have the lyrics to La Mer?  Something about having fun on a beach, and <br>
	elephants.  Bath of Bacon, also insane.<br>
	<br>
	A Scandal In Bohemia - finally, I got to hear Soul Happy Hour!  not<br>
	really listening the first time I heard Just Like Betty Page (btw who<br>
	the heck is/was Betty Page?) ... &quot;what the HECK?&quot; ... listens more closely...<br>
	oh my!!  Didn't quite expect this song! *grin*<br>
	<br>
	Sex And Travel - I'd already heard Big Saturday &amp; Reagan's BDay Present.<br>
	Good overall, odd as usual. :)<br>
	<br>
	Hamburg - a lot of fun... nice inside slip with lyrics (!!) and a cool photo<br>
	collage (though that's not news to those of you who have it).  Does Count<br>
	Dracula or Death Dentist ever get played these days?  I've gotta request<br>
	one of them if/when I finally get to a JB show, especially if they haven't :)<br>
	<br>
	Anyone have comments?  What are your favourite songs from the earlier albums?<br>
	<br>
	Someone tell the manager that chicken is sick!<br>

	Good to know that &quot;Chickentown&quot; really was that impromptu, and that Pat<br>
	enjoyed it as much as I did.<br>
	<br>
	How's the dubbing going with my DAT. Do you want to do an extra copy for Pat<br>
	and pass it on to him with my compliments? Although he'll be sad to know<br>
	that I lost the last half of &quot;Walk with the Devil&quot;, (that was my<br>

	<br>
	Do you know where this Friday's gig is happening, by the way? I didn't get<br>

	Wow, thanks for all the info straight from the Butcher's mouth!<br>
	Most edifying.  <br>
	<br>
	I have to ask though:  Is it the case that everything posted on<br>
	this list eventually makes to Pat?  Or that anything posted on<br>
	the list might possibly make it to him?  Or do you, Del, simply<br>
	forward those you think might be of interest?  As you might <br>
	imagine, I'm a little chastened by his comments to me re:<br>
	what the hell was everyone talking about with his life being<br>
	lousy around the time of Condition Blue.  Ironically, I still<br>
	don't know the answer to this question.  Is that because <br>
	everyone else knew that Butch himself might well read what they<br>
	wrote about his mysterious difficulties?  Needless to say, a<br>
	question that might be appropriate to a bunch of fellow fans<br>
	on a bulletin board (and I still think mine was, really) is <br>
	not necessarily a question I would put to Pat in person.  Oh<br>
	well, at least he didn't seem too angry in his reply.<br>
	<br>
	Honestly, all I wanted to know was like maybe one sentence:<br>
	Pat had a nasty breakup with his girlfriend, or Pat was <br>
	audited by the British tax authorities, or Pat was the <br>
	subject of a sleazy bio by Albert Goldman,<br>
	something like that.   More in part two, as I'm about to be<br>
	disconnected.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> More re feedback from JB
	<p>
	As I was saying, I felt a bit like one who had been tattled on<br>
	for making a joke or comment at the expense of a friend, who<br>
	then found out about it.  In other words, more mad at myself<br>
	for being foolish, but mildly annoyed at the tattler and a bit<br>
	aggravated (completely unfairly) at the person who was the butt<br>
	of the joke, just because they've found you out.  Know what I<br>
	mean?  I don't want to blow this out of proportion because <br>
	his reply was pretty gracious and I did deserve some ridicule,<br>
	I suppose, and it's not that big of a deal.  I just wish I had <br>
	known ahead of time that my comments might be audited by<br>
	Butch himself.  If that's a general policy, could we have a <br>
	periodic warning for the benefit of those new to the list?  If<br>
	only certain messages are being passed along, would it be <br>
	possible to check with the authors first, in accordance with<br>
	general netiquette?  Again, it's not that big a deal, but I<br>
	post it because I think others might have thoughts on the <br>
	issue as well.  Anyone?<br>
	<br>
	So if you see Pat again, will you pass along my apologies<br>
	for being nosy, tell him I was suitably chastened by his <br>
	retort, and let him know that no one ever answered my <br>
	inquiry anyway.  Thanks.  ;)<br>
	<br>
	One last thing:  Though it doesn't justify my prurient<br>
	interest, I want to comment on Pat's remark that the price<br>
	of a CD and a concert every year doesn't entitle one to<br>
	know all about an artist's personal life.  He's right in<br>
	principle, of course, but he might forget what it's like to<br>
	be a fan, since he's been on the other side of the stage<br>
	for ten years now.  Those of us who loyally follow a band<br>
	that's not so well known, as is true of JB in the US, do <br>
	tend to develop a proprietary interest in that band.  It's<br>
	because we discovered the artist ourselves, had to haunt <br>
	used record stores for years before we tracked down all<br>
	the poorly distributed early work.  We told our like-<br>
	minded friends about the artist and pestered them until<br>
	they listened to the records.  We bought every CD when<br>
	it came out, and pestered our music stores if they didn't<br>
	carry it or took a long time to order it.  We not only <br>
	went to see the band in our hometown, we drove or flew to<br>
	other cities to see the band.  We dragged our girlfriends<br>
	or boyfriends or spouses, our brothers and sisters, our <br>
	friends to the show, even though they had no real <br>
	interest in going.  (My record was 8 people who'd never<br>
	heard of the Butcher.)  That may not seem like much but<br>
	when the turnout is embarassingly small due to lack of <br>
	support from record companies, press, and radio, 8 people<br>
	can be 8% of the whole crowd.  We play the records at <br>
	parties and wait for folks to ask what it is.  We call<br>
	college radio and pester them to play it.  If we're lucky<br>
	enough to know people in the business, we talk the band up<br>
	at every opportunity.  So it's natural to begin to feel<br>
	like you have an interest (in the financial sense and <br>
	otherwise), because there is a real investment of time<br>
	and energy.  That's why, for example, I was so <br>
	depressed for my city that only 100 folks showed up to see<br>
	Richard Thompson on the tour for his best album in <br>
	years.  That's why I was so pissed off that the Mekons<br>
	opted to blow off their Cleveland show because they didn't <br>
	fell like leaving Chicago.  And that's why I bother to<br>
	read this group and post to it.  Curiosity about the<br>
	personal lives of our favorite groups must be annoying to<br>
	the artists, I suppose, but it's only the flip side of <br>
	all the support those fans give the artist.  In other words, <br>
	I wouldn't give a shit about what was up with Butch if<br>
	I didn't love his music so darn much.<br>
	<br>
	Darn it, I went and wrote a rant.  I didn't intend to, but<br>
	there it is.  You'll have to take my word that I'm really<br>
	not mad at anyone (besides myself, a bit) over being<br>
	embarassed a little in front of one of my favorite<br>
	musicians.  <br>
	<br>
	Flames to above address; let's not choke the list with<br>
	abuse for me.<br>
	;-)<br>
	<br>
	Del, thanks for all the inside scoop, which far <br>
	outweighed any discomfort I felt!<br>

	Part One (or &quot;If you're angry, stop... and think.&quot;)<br>
	<br>
	I don't really want to be drawn into a discussion about whether Pat<br>
	can drag individual members of the jbc-list through hellfire because<br>
	we're rude about him. Strikes me he has a perfect right to, actually.<br>
	Just as we all (well, me at least) have a right to be as rude as we<br>
	want about the records he releases. The problem arises simply because<br>
	what Pat responds to is a list-snippet and could be taken out of<br>

	Trauma&quot; question and Pat didn't roast me alive for *that* at least.<br>
	<br>
	I got what I deserved, but he deserves a severe talking to as a<br>
	result. &quot;Get a fucking haircut&quot; indeed! The cheek of the man!<br>
	<br>
	Part Two<br>
	<br>
	Any reaction from the Distressed Gentlefolk brigade about Pat's<br>

	<br>
	Part Three<br>

	Just thought I'd mention that by sheer coincidence I'll be in London<br>
	on Friday so I might just pop along to the Powerhaus gig. Should be<br>
	quite a giggle. Any questions, requests (apologies, even) for the<br>
	great man?<br>
	<br>
	Sorry, but I can't bootleg unless I can lug my portastudio into the<br>

	I'm not too surprised at Pat's dislike for this record.  It was already obvious<br>
	in David's '89 interview.  I think the things about the JBC that we appreciate<br>
	are not not necessarily related to the reality of the JBC.  It all depends<br>
	on your viewpoint, of course.  <br>
	<br>
	This happens a lot anyway ( Richard Thompson hates &quot;Small Town Romance&quot;, a <br>
	highly acclaimed record).<br>
	<br>
	The JBC played in Los Osos in 1992?  Well, I'll be darned.  I guess you never<br>
	know who you might run into in a redneck town on the central California coast.<br>

	&gt; I'm not too surprised at Pat's dislike for this record.  It was already<br>
	&gt; obvious in David's '89 interview.  I think the things about the JBC that<br>
	&gt; we appreciate are not not necessarily related to the reality of the JBC.<br>
	&gt; It all depends on your viewpoint, of course.  <br>
	<br>
	I guess my favorites always seem to be the artists least favorites... but I<br>
	was surprised that Butch mentioned the &quot;new world&quot; along with favorites like<br>
	falling in love and angels.  I always regarded that as the break between the<br>
	good songs.  Sort of a recovery, although i like max's mellow groove.<br>

	<br>
	-&gt;I'm not too surprised at Pat's dislike for this record.  It was already<br>
	-&gt;obvious in David's '89 interview.  I think the things about the JBC that we<br>
	-&gt;appreciate are not not necessarily related to the reality of the JBC.  It all<br>
	-&gt;depends on your viewpoint, of course.  <br>
	-&gt;This happens a lot anyway ( Richard Thompson hates &quot;Small Town Romance&quot;, a <br>
	-&gt;highly acclaimed record).<br>
	<br>
	Seems to me the musicians involved are always going to have different<br>
	perspectives on the album than the rest of us.  Some of that is outside<br>
	of the music itself (they were depressed, the producer was a jerk, etc.)<br>
	but some of it has to do with their intent and how well they feel they<br>
	achieved that.  So the JBC (just f'rinstance) may think that some album<br>
	isn't nearly as good as it should have been because it isn't noisy and<br>
	raucous enough, wheras listeners might say &quot;what a great pop album&quot;.  We<br>
	really have no way of knowing what it was supposed to be like.<br>
	<br>
	Julian Cope made his masterpiece, &quot;Fried&quot;, at a time when he was apparently<br>
	very depressed and fucked up.  I certainly wouldn't wish another period<br>
	like that on him, or anyone else.  However, since his life got better I've<br>
	lost interest in his music.  Interviews I've read with him indicate that<br>
	he's not that fond of &quot;Fried&quot; and thinks his later stuff is better.<br>
	<br>
	Based on Pat's auto-discography (which, by the way, is both a nice idea --<br>
	anyone remember when Trouser Press used to feature this kind of thing? --<br>
	and also offered a lot of interesting perspectives.  Thanks to Pat and<br>
	to David for typing it all in) (what a long parenthetical THAT was!) <br>
	Anyway, based on Pat's auto-discography I'd say that I think much more highly<br>
	of &quot;Scandal&quot; than he does.  I can understand why he might feel a bit <br>
	embarrased about it, but there's no reason I have to.<br>

	Thanks to those who responded with commiseration, jokes, <br>

	that I reread it) would have made me serious flamebait in many<br>
	other groups.  Never let it be said that the fans of the JBC are<br>
	not a humane bunch.  David, thanks for your response and sorry<br>
	I got a little overwrought.  Like I said, the other tidbits<br>
	straight from the Fish lips were extremely cool.<br>
	<br>
	Only one thing... seems like everybody else thought Butch was<br>
	rougher on me than _I_ thought he was.  Perhaps David can tell<br>
	him about those darn smiley faces we so depend on here on the<br>
	net, so there will be no further ambiguous messages.<br>

	Didn't tape it, but Pat and his underrehearsed (so he claimed in the bar)<br>
	band played a pretty good show. It was the first time I'd seen him playing<br>
	with a band, and, in contrast to the Mean Fiddler gig, it was very loud and<br>
	quite energetic. Pat managed to break 3 guitar strings, two going<br>
	simultaneously during She's on Drugs.<br>
	<br>
	A very rough set list:<br>
	<br>
	She's a Yo-Yo<br>
	Bakersfield<br>
	Ghosts<br>
	Mr Odd<br>
	Sister Death<br>
	Racheland<br>
	Shirley Maclaine<br>
	She's on Drugs<br>
	President Chang<br>
	Angels<br>
	Caroline Wheeler (What an excellent song live)<br>
	<br>
	And probably some others I forgot.<br>
	They didn't come on till about 11pm though, which was a bit odd.<br>
	<br>
	Listening to the Condition Blue stuff live, I don't know what we've been<br>
	moaning on about. It's fine, fine music.<br>
	<br>
	I passed on my May 15th Mean Fiddler tape to Pat, which he seemed to<br>
	appreciate, and shared reminiscences of how fucking cool the Velvets had<br>
	been at Wembley.<br>
	<br>
	Oh well, I guess that's it for another 3 years (approx the last time Pat<br>
	played in London with a band).<br>

	<p>
	Phew, Rock'n'Roll.<br>
	<br>
	Left work 5pm Thursday, rushed to the airport, caught the 6pm flight,<br>
	experienced usual dilemma about whether to drink *both* gin and tonics<br>
	on the plane or to save one 'til later (as it turns out, the beer at<br>
	the Powerhaus is terrible so I should have done), but after drinking<br>
	two I was more relaxed and thus better able to cope with discovering<br>
	that there were no trains from Heathrow to central london that night<br>
	due to &quot;a passenger placing themselves under a train&quot; at Hounslow West<br>
	(obviously not a JBC fan). Correction: there was only one train that<br>
	evening. Rushed through the crowds, onto the train, up to King's<br>
	Cross, along Pentonville Road, past Angel Station (fact fans!) to the<br>
	Powerhaus. Collapsed exhausted.<br>
	<br>
	Support Bands: The Divided. Not bad actually, they had a loyal crowd.<br>
	Heavy bass lines, rocky toons, sort of a cheerful The The. With more<br>
	hair. Second Support were crap I have forgotten their name but they<br>
	obviously listen to far too much Dave Kusworth for their own good.<br>
	<br>
	The amended set list. The order is rough because some git stole my pen<br>
	while I was at the bar so I couldn't write it down until I got back<br>
	home. Anyway, these *are* the songs:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	The Basement<br>
	&gt; She's a Yo-Yo<br>
	&gt; Bakersfield<br>
	&gt; Ghosts<br>
	&gt; Mr Odd<br>
	${icon_blank}	SweetWater<br>
	${icon_blank}	Killed Out<br>
	&gt; Sister Death<br>
	&gt; Racheland<br>
	&gt; Shirley Maclaine<br>
	&gt; She's on Drugs<br>
	${icon_blank}	Girl Go<br>
	&gt; President Chang<br>
	Encores:<br>
	&gt; Angels<br>
	&gt; Caroline Wheeler<br>
	<br>
	The band was: Pat, Alex Lee, Paul Mulreany and Dooj<br>
	<br>
	Pat tried his best to justify Condition Blue to me but I was taking no<br>
	prisoners. That said, Racheland (live) was a cracker, I have to admit.<br>
	The other surprise of the evening was &quot;President Chang&quot; which rocked!<br>
	Really very good live and I totally revise my opinion of it song-wise.<br>
	<br>
	It's been a long time since I last saw him live, and I have to say<br>
	that it was really very good indeed. I would start looking forward to<br>
	the US tour now, if I were you.<br>

	<p>
	Apparantly the Jazz Butcher has got himself a new agent.<br>
	<br>
	I just called ABS and, even though they're listed on the<br>
	Waiting For the Love Bus liner notes they said they're no longer<br>
	his agent.  Someone called Forward Management is but the nice<br>
	lady I talked to didn't have a number for them. <br>
	${icon_blank} <br>
	Can anyone out there in the U.K. give me a number for Forward <br>
	Management?<br>

	&lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_press}/93cdconnection.html&quot;&gt;review from online Compact Disc Connection listing.&lt;/a&gt;<br>
	<br>
	i found this (sole) jbc listing in the commercial venture<br>
	Compact Disc Connection, which is available through telnet at 157.151.0.1 23<br>
	<br>
	from this review, i am guessing that msr parisien must have heard<br>
	the 1992 CBC radio interview, as the highlights are nearly identical.<br>
	<br>
	this was listed as being on the &quot;DOG GONE&quot; label,<br>
	which i havent heard of before.<br>

	<p>
	you know...<br>
	i give Big Planet Scarey Planet a spin about once a year,<br>
	and tonight, locked in my office with a deadline bearing<br>
	down on me, it REALLY fits the bill.<br>
	<br>
	when pat said:<br>
	${icon_blank}        A curious record.  If you actually put it on and play it then it's<br>
	${icon_blank}        pretty smart; it's just that I never really seem to WANT to put it on.<br>
	<br>
	to some extent he is right.<br>
	the production ala john rivers, just isnt *right* for this<br>
	sample-laden album.  for one, there is just too much reverb,<br>
	particularily on the drums.<br>
	<br>
	i hadnt paid attention to it before but:<br>
	${icon_blank}        We were all aware<br>
	${icon_blank}        that music was changing, and, more out of interest than out of any<br>
	${icon_blank}        spurious &quot;career&quot; concern, we wanted to see where we could take our<br>
	${icon_blank}        pop songs using things like breakdowns, the mixing in of &quot;found&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	voices...<br>
	<br>
	wow.  yeah.  very few of the tunes are in the typical butcher structure,<br>
	and there are changes where you wouldnt expect them.<br>
	i wonder how much that laurence (the bass player) had to do with it?<br>
	it seems that the unconventional changes are most obvious when<br>
	paying attention to the fretless that laurence played.<br>
	<br>
	anyway.<br>
	i always liked 2 or 3 of the tunes, but now i think i will<br>
	give it chances more often.<br>
	<br>
	the John Cale/&quot;special guests&quot; (thats what the NME said, anyway) gig<br>
	is coming up.  those in attendance may run into martin stebbing if<br>
	they are unlucky enough..<br>

	Little bit of trivia. On Friday night, the band in session on John Peel<br>

	<p>
	&gt; you know...<br>
	&gt; i give Big Planet Scarey Planet a spin about once a year,<br>
	&gt; and tonight, locked in my office with a deadline bearing<br>
	&gt; down on me, it REALLY fits the bill.<br>
	<br>
	ohmigod I know that feeling.<br>
	<br>
	I always thought that the trouble with BPSP was that is was an album<br>
	without a mood. Y'know, you can think of a time when most records will<br>
	be played. Condition Blue, for instance, would be best played when you<br>
	are sitting in alone at night with a bottle of whisky and you're<br>
	getting divorced (for instance). Fishcotheque is that happy find: an<br>
	album that fits a particular mood exactly when you didn't realise there<br>
	was a need for it. In this case, Fishcotheque is a waking up with a<br>
	slight hangover on Sunday morning and it's frosty outside and I think<br>
	I'll nip out and buy a newspaper but not yet because it's warm here in<br>
	bed record. Honest, it is.<br>
	<br>
	But BPSP just isn't anything very much. They experiment with structure<br>
	and so on so you just get a collection of (feisty) songs (some good)<br>
	but there's no theme or coherence to it and I just don't really want to<br>
	ever play it. &quot;Hysteria&quot; is quite a good record to play if your back is<br>
	itching and you can't reach round to scratch it, but only because it's<br>
	such a bastard annoying song that you forget about the itch.<br>
	<br>
	That aside, individual sngs are all good and it's hard to pick out the<br>
	outstanding tracks.<br>
	<br>
	Moodwise, perhaps ineffectual rage at circumstances you can't<br>
	control (qv deadlines bearing down) is the best I can give it. I<br>
	will go away, get ineffectually annoyed at something (should be<br>
	quite easy at the moment, the government being what it is) and come<br>
	back to you on this.<br>
	<br>
	What the hell do I know? I just had half an hour to kill so I thought<br>
	I'd burble away to the void.<br>

	&gt; see any good shows?  like any records in particular?<br>
	I have never seen the JB (but of course, would like to) and I haven't seen<br>
	much of anybody lately.  I live in the Northwest (Oregon) so live shows<br>
	are not a daily occurance.  The best show I saw this summer was The The in<br>
	Portland on the Dusk tour.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank} &gt; what you think of the new one?  etc..<br>
	Here is where the problem lies.  I don't even know what the latest is! <br>
	For some strange reason I have yet to figure out, the Jazz Butcher is<br>
	virturally unheard of around here.  There is not one single record (CD)<br>
	shop in this town who carry ANY JB cds.  And even the store I do most of<br>
	my cd buying at in Eugene, OR (a large city) which boasts &quot;the largest cd<br>
	selection in the Northwest&quot;, doesn't even have a JB section!<br>
	I moved here 4 years ago from Colorado where he is quite popular.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, the lastest JB I have is &quot;Cult of the Basement&quot; (and even that is<br>
	just a cassette tape).  What I've been looking for for years and years is,<br>
	a cd version of JB (I'm ashamed to admit, I don't know the title of it)<br>
	album with &quot;The JB meets the Prime Minister&quot; and &quot;Partytime&quot;.  Has this<br>
	one been released on cd and if so what label?<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank} &gt; please introduce yourself to the rest of the list!<br>
	I think I probably just did.<br>
	<br>
	Well, thanks for asking.<br>

	<p>
	En attendant l'autobus de l'amour (?) --- Big Saturday in New Cross<br>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
	<br>
	Whoa.  We're back.  Strange weekend.  Hit fogbound London Friday from the<br>
	M4.  Motorway closed at Reading due to bits of vee-hickles scattered<br>
	liberally like broken crockery.  Picking our way through the wreckage to a<br>
	Robyn Hitchcock gig in Islington.  Which is cancelled due to flu.<br>
	<br>
	Spend the night in weird flat in Brixton.  Woken 5 a.m. by hungry feline<br>
	wielding squeaky rubber mouse.  Saturday took the beat-up VW to New Cross<br>
	Hell.  If you thought it was grim up North, you've never been to SE14.  We<br>
	were worried that we might not get in.  Or out.<br>
	<br>
	Support band the Wishplants: maybe we're cloth-eared, but to us they<br>
	sounded like donkeys in feedback.  Music to fill paper bags with.  But NO<br>
	inflight magazine.  We hid upstairs upstairs in the Venue.  Ah, the Venue.<br>
	A hundred floors, a million red-carpeted corridors, a bad dream interior.<br>
	<br>
	And the people?  There's me.  And Fleur.  And Paul from Sheffield.  And<br>
	Paul's mate.  And Andy's cousin.  And maybe another twenty or so.  To see<br>
	the band, that is.  There are a few hundred others who are waiting for the<br>
	bands to fuck off so the club can start.<br>
	<br>
	Whoa.  He's back.  Pat on stage.  With Dave Cavanagh, someone says?  Not<br>
	the journalist from Select?  Not the 17th guitarist in the Blue Aeroplanes?<br>
	And a bassist who looks like Captain Sensible's kid brother.  The day<br>
	finally makes sense for the faithful.  Guitar guitar bass drum machine.<br>
	<br>
	She's a Yo-Yo, Bakersfield, Mr Odd, Shirley Maclaine, She's on Drugs,<br>
	Sister Death, President Chang.  Maybe a couple more.  They played well in<br>
	the face of adversity.  They looked good.  Sensible bassist leaps too much<br>
	but let off due to obvious passion for songs.  Almost in tears. <br>
	<br>
	After sound thrashing of cocaine aristocracy, Pat retreats.  Throws down<br>
	telecaster.  Bass flung after it.  Feedback.  Mr Cavanagh, if it is he,<br>
	carefully places guitar in flight case and walks.  And it's over.  The<br>
	smoke starts, the lights go down, the club begins.  <br>
	<br>
	Pat.  We love you.  At the very least, we love your music.  The new album<br>
	is the best thing you've ever done.  No question.  <br>
	<br>
	You deserve more than this.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> (forwarded mesg)
	<p>
	Greetings from Hobart, Tasmania. I first found out about JBC when a friend<br>
	from Canada sent me a tape that had Water, Big Bad Thing, Party Time, Peter<br>
	Lorre and Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present on it. Scraping and scrounging<br>
	in record shops have netted me copies of &quot;Bath Of Bacon&quot;, &quot;Distressed<br>
	Gentlefolk&quot;, &quot;Cult Of The Basement&quot; and &quot;Fishcotheque&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	Scrounging is continuing. The only JBC song that I have ever heard on radio<br>
	here in Tassie was &quot;She's On Drugs&quot;. My personal favourite song is &quot;Nothing<br>
	Special&quot;, something to do with long hours spent on trains going through<br>
	country Victoria several years ago.<br>
	<br>
	No idea about the Australian release of &quot;Shirley Maclaine&quot;, I'm afraid I<br>
	haven't seen or heard the new album. There is one record shop in Hobart where<br>
	you can get &quot;non-US-influenced-mainstream&quot; records; they had a section marked<br>
	Jazz Butcher which only contained one second-hand copy of &quot;Distressed<br>
	Gentlefolk&quot;. The hunt continues shortly in Melbourne and Auckland...<br>

	I have been searching the music stores that I have phone #'s for in Canada and<br>
	the US for a CD copy of The Gift of Music (I think it was released in 1986<br>
	on CD, according to a JB discography I got somewhere).  Can someone tell<br>
	me, am I wasteing my time?  I know its now longer in print in the US but<br>
	does anyone know where I might find a copy?  Or how about the Bloody<br>
	Nonsense collection; was it ever released on CD (I think its still<br>
	availabe on tape).  Why, you ask, am I so fixed on getting these two? <br>
	Because I'd like to get JB vs PM and Partytime on CD.  Can someone suggest<br>
	the best alternative to getting them both on the same CD (i.e. which<br>
	compilation still in print is the best)?<br>

	Bloody Nonsense has suffered the same fate -- it was released by Big Time,<br>

	<p>
	I have just been on a well earned holiday for 6 weeks, so this is why<br>
	these responses are a bit late....<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for the translation of ``La Mer'' for the non Francophones<br>
	(French speakers). Seeing as you managed to translate all of the song,<br>
	I was suprised that you stumbled on the first line:<br>
	<br>
	&gt; La mer viens ? ?  (can anyone tell me the end of this line?)<br>
	<br>
	Viens -&gt; comes (verb venir, irregular of course)<br>
	<br>
	Having moved back to England, I got a subscription to the excellent<br>
	``Les Inrockuptilbles'' from which I have already sent a few postings.<br>
	When you subscribed, you get one of their current special compilation<br>
	CD's. The thing which swayed me into subscribing was the fact that the<br>
	JBC features on the CD with ``Rosemary Davis world of sound''. Other<br>
	bands featured include: American Music Club, BMX Bandits, Boo Radleys,<br>
	Divine Comedy, Red House Painters, Teenage Fan Club plus a collection<br>
	of French artists (Jean-Louis Murat, Silvian Vanot, etc.). I haven't<br>
	had a good hard listen to it but it sounds pretty good.<br>
	<br>
	I seem to recall from postings a few months ago that people didn't<br>
	like Rosemary Davis. Having bought Waiting for the Love Bus, I think<br>
	it is one of my favorite tracks on it - the sort of track you end up<br>
	humming in the bath. I actually bought WFTLB in Australia (HMV). In my<br>
	many hours spent loitering in record shops, most had some JBC<br>
	material. I even saw a copy of Fishcoteque in a Virgin store.<br>
	Unfortunately, I didn't buy it as I had already placed an order at<br>
	another record shop who assurred me that it was in stock at their<br>
	distributors and I could get it in a week. After two weeks it hadn't<br>
	turn up, I didn't have time to go back to Virgin and I had to fly out.<br>
	Next time I will just buy it, even if I end up buying two copies!<br>
	<br>
	A plus<br>
	<br>
	Joe<br>

	<p>
	&gt; <br>
	&gt; No idea about the Australian release of &quot;Shirley Maclaine&quot;, I'm afraid I<br>
	&gt; haven't seen or heard the new album. There is one record shop in Hobart where<br>
	&gt; you can get &quot;non-US-influenced-mainstream&quot; records; they had a section marked<br>
	&gt; Jazz Butcher which only contained one second-hand copy of &quot;Distressed<br>
	&gt; Gentlefolk&quot;. The hunt continues shortly in Melbourne and Auckland...<br>
	&gt;<br>
	Hmm. I have seen most JBC stuff in shops here in small town Perth (the most <br>
	isolated city in the world). Including Condition Blue, recent singles, and the<br>
	Australian release of Shirley Maclaine (on a nifty little EP with Shes on Drugs<br>
	and a few others). Older stuff, however, is very hard to find.<br>
	${icon_blank}	If you are having trouble, talk directly to the distributors, Shock!,<br>
	who are in Melbourne. I'm sure they will at least be happy to tell you of a <br>
	record shop that wil order from them.<br>

	&gt; Whoa.  He's back.  Pat on stage.  With Dave Cavanagh, someone says?  Not<br>
	&gt; the journalist from Select?  Not the 17th guitarist in the Blue Aeroplanes?<br>
	<br>
	nope.  twas richard formby.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; After sound thrashing of cocaine aristocracy, Pat retreats.  Throws down<br>
	&gt; telecaster.  Bass flung after it.  Feedback.  Mr Cavanagh, if it is he,<br>
	&gt; carefully places guitar in flight case and walks.<br>
	${icon_blank} ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
	${icon_blank}                  |<br>
	this should have been your clue.<br>
	as pat put it &quot;richard has more respect for his instrument<br>
	than us NON musicians&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	btw, jim, pat says your review was spot-on, although he wished<br>

	&gt; bj835@cleveland.Freenet.Edu<br>
	&gt; There were rumors on this list a while back that the new CD <br>
	&gt; would be distributed by a major label.<br>
	<br>
	damn.  no idea.  i keep forgetting to ask.<br>
	it does seem like its about time for it to happen<br>
	since the thing has been out for months now..<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Travis@cs.wm.edu<br>
	&gt; What is the newest album by the Jazz Butcher?<br>
	<br>
	1993 CD CREATION CRECD156 Waiting For The Love Bus<br>
	${icon_blank}	Rosemary Davis World Of Sound, Bakersfield,<br>
	${icon_blank}	Kids In The Mall/Kaliningrad, Whaddya?, SweetWater, Ghosts, Baltic,<br>
	${icon_blank}	Killed Out, Ben, Penguins, President Chang, Angel Station,<br>
	${icon_blank}	Rosemary Davis World Of Sound (Reprise)<br>
	as alex@miles.vmars.tuwien.ac.at noted, the bigger black version<br>
	does not have the final track as the CD does.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Has something been released in Britain?<br>
	<br>
	see above.  i hear that there is a german single release<br>
	of the tune &quot;sweetwater&quot;.  alex?  check if this has any<br>
	extra tracks and then send us all copies.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Glen Davis &lt;davisg@BCC.ORST.EDU&gt;<br>
	&gt; Because I'd like to get JB vs PM and Partytime on CD.  Can someone suggest<br>
	&gt; the best alternative to getting them both on the same CD<br>
	<br>
	a CD burner?  may be a bit expensive, though.<br>
	actually, the original Partytime comes on the (ever-so-hard-to-get)<br>
	Bath Of Bacon CD and the (even-more-rare-than-that-SPEX#6-flexi)<br>
	Unconditional CD promo.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; which compilation still in print is the best<br>
	<br>
	Bloody Nonsense -v- The Gift of Music -v- The Gift of Music II.<br>
	<br>
	Bloody Nonsense and The Gift of Music II are *similar*, but<br>
	Gift II contains some less hard tunes like Olof Palme, Vienna Song,<br>
	City Of Night, etc.  Bloody Nonsense is more straight forward<br>
	for us attention-lacking 'merkans.<br>
	if you ever see the vinyl of Gift II - CHECK INSIDE.<br>
	thats the only place you are likely to find the freebie<br>
	7&quot; which contains May I, Over You, Speedy Gonzalez and<br>
	Knocking On Heavens Door.<br>
	<br>
	The Gift of Music - the first one, is a different animal.<br>
	i find this disc to be rawer, and the David J influence is in full-effect.<br>
	<br>
	would there be any interest for making available a compilation<br>
	of these old &quot;strange&quot; tunes?  there are probably 20 or so tunes<br>
	which only appeared on b-sides.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Stewart Evans &lt;stewarte@sco.COM&gt;<br>
	&gt; but rumor has it that Glass went belly-up a few years ago<br>
	<br>
	fact.  same with BigTime.  this man has had little luck with labels.<br>
	or promotion.  creation seems solid at least.<br>
	<br>
	sort-of news:<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	apparently touring is done with until early february.<br>
	${icon_blank}		there is one planned christmastime gig in northampton.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	their (latest, ex) drummer nick burson is blissfully<br>
	${icon_blank}		married in the arctic canaidjun tundra (well, toronto),<br>
	${icon_blank}		and it sounds like he is happiest there.<br>
	${icon_blank}		(i wonder if richard found it insulting to have to play<br>
	${icon_blank}		along with a drummachine at the last gig?)<br>

	Is it? Aside from the well-worn problems with the sound, is it a fair<br>
	reflection of the JBC live experience on the road 1992/3? Like, how do<br>
	the Western Family tracklist and yer actual live-experience setlist<br>
	compare? I ask curiously, from a &quot;didn't get to see JBC for AGES and am<br>
	beginning to feel a little left out in a sort of 'Early 1990s: the<br>
	wilderness years' kind of way&quot; standpoint.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; feeling doesn't come.  Unless you're drinking tequila and cooking mexican<br>
	&gt; food.  With the CD on a blaster.  On the kitchen table.<br>
	<br>
	OK. I tried gin, tortilla chips and my flatmates extra-big stereo but<br>
	it still sounded like they were singing into tin cans connected to v e<br>
	r y l o n g pieces of string with a dusty old reel-to-reel recording<br>
	it all at the other end. Kinda stunted my appreciation.<br>

	&gt; tell me you wouldnt have made the same typo, ed?<br>

	oh indeedy! it's only through massive indirection that I found this one<br>

	<br>

<br>
	<br>
	&gt; would there be any interest for making available a compilation of these<br>

	&gt; across.<br>
	<br>
	Hey! Up here, there are THREE copies in central Edinburgh alone. And<br>
	someone has just bought the last remaining copy of Western Family from<br>

	<br>
	well, you dont really get a sense of the drinking, the scenery,<br>
	the drinking, the miles, the drinking, or the drinking,<br>
	but yes - obviously the tunes on the CD *had* to have come<br>
	from the 92tour.<br>
	<br>
	oh.  erm..  beside the order of the CD tracks being different<br>
	from a typical show, i think it is fairly accurate.<br>
	fyi - Still And All almost always started the show, and the<br>
	covers (or the odd old tune) would come at the ends.<br>
	Shirley always preceeded Racheland which ended in a big big<br>
	howling mess before the covers started.<br>

	If we're still talking about B-sides of singles, then is this really<br>

	single ever... I think it's a vinyl version of Girl Go.  Were there singles <br>
	for Condition Blue?  I wasn't aware of any of them.  :(  Let's face it, in <br>

	singles really stinks.  And I've read that supposedly Canada is better<br>
	than the States, in this respect?  I mean - I seriously doubt I will<br>
	ever be able to obtain ANY Jazz Butcher singles at this rate.  And for<br>
	some people in cultural wasteland (you pick your choice of wasteland -<br>
	I'm not trying to single out anyplace :) the chances are even slimmer.<br>
	<br>
	I've never seen a JB video, for that matter!<br>
	<br>
	(Yes, I haunt used record stores, and that's why I *do* have most of the<br>
	albums.  Are we all supposed to have so much money that we can import-order<br>

	What about the possibility of an official release of a B-sides compilation?  <br>

	Hello, all...<br>
	<br>
	Just thought I'd write a quick note to introduce myself, since I just<br>
	joined the list...<br>
	<br>
	I've been a fan of the jbc for a few years now, and I tried to join the list<br>
	last year, but I was never able to get added, unfortunately...at any rate, I'm <br>
	here now, so all's well.<br>
	<br>
	I don't have a real extensive collection, unfortunately, although I did <br>
	recently come across the 12&quot; of Human Jungle.  I've been looking for the <br>
	reissues of all their earlier stuff (Gift of Music pt 2, etc) for about a<br>
	year, but still haven't found a whole lot.<br>
	<br>
	I did pick up Waiting for the Love Bus when it came out, and I like it, <br>
	although I like the earlier stuff a bit more.<br>
	<br>
	I am now done rambling.<br>

	video for Spooky on a Creation compilation and I've seen a creaky old video<br>
	for Jazz Butcher Meets Count Dracula which was in the unlikely middle of<br>
	the &quot;Blood on the cats&quot; compilation, nestling amoungst West Midlands<br>
	Rockabilly and old Birthday Party covers by bands you've never heard of.<br>
	I know there's also a video for Girl Go on *another* creation video<br>
	compilation but I've never seen it and it's long gone from the shops by now.<br>
	<br>
	So I ask: do we have a `videography'? Both Spooky and JBmCD were<br>
	astoundingly fun, being Butch and band running about and having a laff as<br>
	far as I can tell. Very cheap, too.<br>

	<br>
	hell, it's nearly Xmas...<br>
	<br>

	&gt; drinking being a major aspect of a JB tour, I guess I miss the point...<br>
	<br>
	Well, here's an interesting one. Does not drinking mean that you listen along<br>
	to SoulHappyHour in a state of slight puzzlement in the same way that<br>
	(perhaps) others listen to the intense, introspective, emotional trawls (or at<br>
	least the explicitly autobiographical tunes) without much of a clue?<br>
	<br>
	By extension, if you don't come from Northampton is your enjoyment of<br>
	jbc-product terminally stunted? What about if you're not called Pat Fish?<br>
	Goodness, perhaps we should all give up now and go home. Or change our names.<br>

	idea:<br>
	<br>
	If you folks want to check out the local record/cd/tape stores and let me<br>
	know what kind of supply we have going, and post a summary.  Then, people<br>
	could email whoever it was that located the disks they want and arrange<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Introducing
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Bob and I am a new member of the JBC.  I recently<br>
	found out about the list after sending a note to a member of another<br>
	mailing list (Tim Connors) who a JB quote in his .sig.  He was kind<br>
	enough to inform me of this list.<br>
	<br>
	I've been listening to the Butcher since the mid 80's.  I was first<br>
	introduced to him via a tape of the 'Sex and Travel' ep (I believe that<br>
	was the title, I never got the actual pressing -IDIOT-).  It had Big<br>
	Saturday on it if I remember.<br>
	<br>
	The first time I saw the JB was in Manchester in 1985,  they opened for<br>
	an american band that was part of a sixties revival movement (I don't<br>
	quite recall the name, It might have had rain in the name).  They did an<br>
	encore together though once again my memory fails me.<br>
	<br>
	I have since seen him an the various incarnations every time they have<br>
	played Seaatle plus a couple of trips up to Vancouver, BC.  There hasn't<br>
	been a visit here in over a year and a half,  and I am starting to get<br>
	alittle itchy.<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps I haven't been looking hard enopugh but the latest release I<br>
	have is 'Western Family', I have't seen the new studio release, so<br>
	perhaps someone would be kind enough to fill in some details for me.<br>
	<br>
	I think that as time goes by I find myself listening to 'Fishcoteque'<br>
	and Condition Blue' the most often in their entireties.  Though their<br>
	are many individual songs that rank as favorites.  These would include<br>
	'Rain' - ''Big Saturday' - 'Buffalo Shame' - 'PartyTime' - 'Sex and<br>
	Travel' - the list goes on...<br>
	${icon_blank} <br>
	${icon_blank} I am getting a bit lengthy I see, so I will say seeya for now, and I am<br>
	${icon_blank} looking forward to hearing from other Butcher listeners (I don't know<br>
	${icon_blank} too many out here that's for sure).  <br>

	<br><b>From:</b> &quot;Clint D. Hartman&quot; &lt;hartman@maroon.tc.umn.edu&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> CD Europe
	<p>
	Last night I ordered the &quot;Black Eg&quot;, the Butch in disguise, by modem from CD <br>
	Europe. I don't have any experience with CD Europe, and was wondering if anyone <br>
	on the list does?<br>
	<br>
	They list all the JBC stuff from Fishcotheque on.  Unfortunately they charge <br>
	your credit card immediately upon placing an order and they do not appear to <br>
	maintain an inventory.  Hmmm, I hope it they can find it...<br>
	<br>
	Also, is there any new material on the SHIRLEY MACLAINE -5 TR.- 5&quot; SINGLE?  I <br>
	lost the latest discography and the one at &lt;cs.uwp.edu&gt; is old.  Could someone <br>
	please e-mail it to me?  Thanks<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> del@ecn.purdue.edu (de l`abattoir)
	<br><b>Subject:</b> happy x-day and all that
	<p>
	howdy.<br>
	the drinking is over, the festivities are done and i am back<br>
	from my vacation to fish town.<br>
	<br>
	it was great to finally meet a few of the jbc-list people<br>
	and to see pat in his home environment.  northampton (probably)<br>
	is an industrial city of a couple hundred thousand and its anyone's<br>
	guess as to why he prefers it there..<br>
	<br>
	for those curious, pat is doing well during this down-time between tours.<br>
	he is content with his girl, his cat, and the incestious clan of<br>
	musicians who live in the area.  pat's house is a smallish two story<br>
	filled with pascal legras paintings.  the guest room is also the archive<br>
	room.  i experienced sensory overload to say the least!<br>
	there are stacks and stacks of magazines, articles and pictures from<br>
	the last decade.  there are also hundreds of cassettes littering the room -<br>
	live gigs, ancient demo tapes, home tapes, rough mixes, and other really<br>
	embarrassing stuff.  unfortunately, he knows what damaging effects the<br>
	distribution of any of this material would have on his career..<br>
	sorry guys, but i did try.<br>
	<br>
	one afternoon i stepped outside just in time to see a teenager in an ugly<br>
	purple windbreaker bend down to pick up a cigarette butt from the street.<br>
	pat, not having witnessed this, then stepped outside.<br>
	he said to me `mark that person, mark that person well -<br>
	for that is the BICYCLE KID'.<br>
	made perfect sense.<br>
	<br>
	while i was there, i attended two gigs - the one on the 23rd at<br>
	the belgium (as i later learned is the code-name for `slurp's wino bar'),<br>
	and a very interesting x-mas gig on the 24th at the racehorse.<br>
	<br>
	the belgium gig was just dooj, pat amd colin the drum machine.<br>
	there were no new tunes, and the only available recording device was a jam box.<br>
	it is pretty unlistenable.  richard formby was supposed to be there too, but<br>
	he had other plans.  sonic boom, and our own matt cockerill were there.<br>
	sonic looks frighteningly like a tall paul weller circa 85, except his hair<br>
	is equal-length on both sides of his head.<br>
	edwardc@aisb.edinburgh.ac.uk was *supposed* to be there, but i didnt see<br>
	him.  since i had told everyone here that the gig was at the &quot;belgium&quot;, i<br>
	had a really horrible feeling that he had hopped on a plane, grabbed<br>
	a taxi and told the driver to take him to the (non-existent) &quot;belgium&quot;.<br>
	ed?  is this what happened?  god i hope not..<br>
	<br>
	the next night at the racehorse was a goody.<br>
	alan moore, pat, and david j plus several other locals were up on stage.<br>
	pat and david j opened with a few duets - `moscow drug club',<br>
	`everybody's talkin', 'hoagy charmichael never went to new orleans',<br>
	`little red corvette' (yup, the prince tune), and a teenage fan club song.<br>
	the last two tunes were at david j's insistance, and pat had been practicing<br>
	all day along with what he had taped down the telephone line when david<br>
	called him the night before.<br>
	pat did some fairly convincing eider twiddling on `hoagy charmichael', btw.<br>
	the show tape is nice, and is placed up for grabs.<br>
	<br>
	note: alan moore should stick to his comic art - he cannot sing.<br>
	<br>
	ben, the son of david j's girlfriend, asked for the jbc-list address,<br>
	so we may be seeing him here soon.<br>
	<br>
	earlier this year i mentioned that there was supposed to be a creation<br>
	release of a &quot;covers record&quot;.  thumbing through pat's cache of test pressings,<br>
	i saw the unreleased article.  unreleased, presumably, because of the version<br>
	of `over the rainbow' that i heard from it.  hehehe.  apparently,<br>
	creation didnt find the humor in a super-lush completely insincere `rainbow'.<br>
	<br>
	jeez.  what else?  lots of late night drinking and talks, but then<br>
	pat likes to drink and talk.<br>
	<br>
	oh yeah.  the US release is a go for february.  because of this, and partly<br>
	because it wouldnt have been economically feasible, i didnt pick up<br>
	any extra copies of the new album.  i did find a &quot;white label&quot; copy<br>
	of the `edward's &quot;cupboard&quot;' compilation album.  seems some entrepreneurial<br>
	radio DJ needed some change.  the tracks are the same as the CD, though.<br>
	<br>
	as promised, i copied some of the harder-to-find vinyl from my collection,<br>
	and the following are available to those who want them...<br>
	${icon_blank}	from 1986 LP 12&quot; GLASS GLAP104 (comes as free EP with GLALP020)<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> kids in the hall
	<p>
	yes.  really.  not in the mall.<br>
	<br>
	has anyone else seen the kids in the hall skit where dave sings<br>
	the tune `terriers'?  it goes something like this:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers are my favourite breed<br>
	${icon_blank}	Cute and cuddly, easy dogs to feed<br>
	${icon_blank}	they will bring you up whenever you are down<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers average twenty pounds<br>
	${icon_blank}	When I walk around this terrier town<br>
	${icon_blank}	One thing that gets me down is when people put<br>
	${icon_blank}	Bandanas on their dogs<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers are my favourite breed<br>
	${icon_blank}	Cute and cuddly,easy dogs to feed<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers were there in the 11th century<br>
	${icon_blank}	Napoleon had one to prevent misery<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers are good for the aged,<br>
	${icon_blank}	Studies show that they prolong old people's lives,<br>
	${icon_blank}	And no one want to die, like this guy died<br>
	${icon_blank}	Die, Die, Die, Die Die Die Die Die<br>
	${icon_blank}	Worms eating - your eyes<br>
	${icon_blank}	(bass solo, women in bikinis)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Terriers sont mes types favouris<br>
	${icon_blank}	Jolies, charmant pas probleme a maintenir<br>
	${icon_blank}	(something in French) quand es tu blue (sic)<br>
	${icon_blank}	(something) vingt livres<br>
	${icon_blank}	Give terriers a chanc<br>
	${icon_blank}	Do the terrier dance<br>
	${icon_blank}	(okay let's not)<br>
	${icon_blank}	But if you want your love to grow<br>
	${icon_blank}	If you want your love to show (oops, switch grow and show)<br>
	${icon_blank}	Then go terry, go terry, go terry, go terry<br>
	${icon_blank}	ERRRRRR<br>
	<br>
	does this sound more than a litle like love kittens?<br>
	<br>
	oh yeah.<br>
	the love bus exists, and it is blue.<br>
