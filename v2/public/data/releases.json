Over the next few years more and more musicians became involved not just from The New Barcelona but from around the world, some still jokey but more and more they became serious production numbers. </p> <p> In 2007 the storyline for that years album was Uncle Andy’s huge charity gig, which at the end of he obviously stole all the takings. That year we finally asked Pat if he wanted to record one and he said he wouldn’t do a Christmas song, but he would record something … and oh did he do something special for us. He came round and recorded a beautiful version of Afterhours from the 3rd Velvet Underground album. </p> <p>   <span class='audioPlayer'> <span class='audio_title'> <i> <span class='song'> <i></i> </span>  </i> </span> <span class='smalltext'> <i>Recorded in December 2007 at Greenway Studio by Andy Clarke</i> </span> <br/> <audio controls='controls' title=' After Hours (Velvet Underground) ' preload='none' class='audio_player'> <source src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.jazzbutcher.com/audio/various/2007_UncleAndy_ChristmasAlbum/2007_UncleAndy_ChristmasAlbum_PatFish_Afterhours.mp3' type='audio/mpeg' /> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> </span> </p>",
