\n\t\tBad souvenir!!! \n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p> \n\t\tAt the end of the show, I saw a guy steal one of my big Sennheiser on the right side of the stage... \n\t\tI was at the other side of the venue... impossible to catch him. \n\t\tI've recorded a ton of concerts in Lyon, it was the only time I've lost something...  \n\t\t</p>","mediaurl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.jazzbutcher.com/audio/gigs/19880415/19880415_JazzButcher_LyonFrance_RailTheatre_FLAC.mp3","mediacredit":"Lolive"},{"type":"set","song":"Southern Mark Smith"},{"type":"set","song":"Real Men"},{"type":"set","song":"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present"},{"type":"set","song":"Spooky"},{"type":"set","song":"Angels"},{"type":"set","song":"Looking For Lot 49"},{"type":"set","song":"Out Of Touch"},{"type":"set","song":"Sex Engine"},{"type":"set","song":"Grey Flannelette"},{"type":"set","song":"Partytime"},{"type":"set","song":"Susie"},{"type":"set","song":"Big Saturday"},{"type":"set","song":"The Best Way"},{"type":"set","song":"Roadrunner","author":"Jonathan Richman"},{"type":"set","song":"Take The Skinheads Bowling","author":"Camper Van Beethoven"},{"type":"set","song":"Zombie Love"},{"type":"set","song":"Olaf Palme"},{"type":"set","song":"Girlfriend"},{"type":"set","song":"La Mer"},{"type":"set","song":"The Entire Performance","comment":"Extracted from youtube video","mediaurl":"https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/audio/19880502/19880502_JazzButcher_Dingwalls.mp3","mediacredit":"FruitierThanThou","mediacrediturl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc7Fcy2yEASuOKzY9gHo5FA"},{"type":"set","song":"Looking For Lot 49"},{"type":"set","song":"Real Men"},{"type":"set","song":"Love Kittens"},{"type":"set","song":"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present"},{"type":"set","song":"Angels"},{"type":"set","song":"Spooky","author":"Hirsch, Shapiro, Middlebrooks"},{"type":"set","song":"Sex Engine"},{"type":"set","song":"Southern Mark Smith"},{"type":"set","song":"Southern Mark Smith"},{"type":"set","song":"Real Men"},{"type":"set","song":"Spooky","author":"Hirsch, Shapiro, Middlebrooks"},{"type":"set","song":"Angels"},{"type":"set","song":"Big Saturday"},{"type":"set","song":"Soul Happy Hour"},{"type":"set","song":"Looking For Lot 49"},{"type":"set","song":"The Best Way"},{"type":"set","song":"Susie"},{"type":"set","song":"Girlfriend"},{"type":"set","song":"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present"},{"type":"set","song":"Sex Engine"},{"type":"set","song":"Zombie Love"},{"type":"encore","song":"Green Acres"},{"type":"encore","song":"The Chinese Envoy","author":"John Cale"},{"type":"encore","song":"Take The Skinheads Bowling","author":"Camper Van Beethoven"},{"type":"encore","song":"The Jazz Butcher Meets Count Dracula"},{"type":"set","song":"Big Saturday"},{"type":"set","song":"Whitfield, Sarah & The Birchfield Road Affair"},{"type":"set","song":"Sex Engine"},{"type":"set","song":"Blame"},{"type":"set","song":"Girl-Go"},{"type":"set","song":"Grey Flannelette"},{"type":"set","song":"The Party's Over","author":"David J."},{"type":"set","song":"The Interview"},{"type":"set","song":"The Entire Performance","comment":"Recorded on AIWA cassette deck with stereo microphone, hand-held in audience, by Douglas Buege.

Jazz Butcher, 100 Club, London. (+ 1 extra track) \n \nVery sad to hear that Pat Fish passed away suddenly. A great talent, passionate about music and a cracking sense of humour. Paying my own tribute by sharing a live gig I recorded when both he and the band I was playing in (Jowe Head's Infernal Contraption) supported The Bevis Frond. Track 8 is taken from when he guested with Television Personalities at a benefit gig for Dan Treacy later that year at the same venue - which for me was the highlight of the night.

Much of this would become the 'Fishcotheque' chapter of 'Miracles and Wonders', the book Pat and I wrote, which I finished and published after he shuffled off on 5th October 2021.\nIt was a lovely, if emotional day.  We ate bagels and smoked cheese at my house, watched the Tottenham game (they lost 3-0 to Brighton), aborted an intended trip to Uppingham, before arriving at the Plough, Shutlanger.  After the recording we went on a little pub crawl, witnessed a skein of geese fly noisily overhead (\"I don't think I've ever seen that before\", said Pat), and consumed a takeaway back at Fishy
