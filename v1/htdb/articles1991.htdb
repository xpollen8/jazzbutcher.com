	the song _father_ contains some lyrics found in the JBC tune _girl-go_.<br>
	_lee_ is an anti-war song dead on mark.  it was recorded before the war shit<br>

	Hello fellow Butchie fans! Well, I was going to be the first to report<br>
	seeing 'Edwards Closet', but I didn't get the address right in time.<br>
	Anyway, my first impression of it was that it was a live set? Too bad<br>
	it appears it's not. Also, our very own David W. is again credited for<br>
	pictures. There are quite a few on the back...which ones are your David?<br>
	<br>
	On 'Bloody Nonsense': nope, definitely not on CD. My impression was that<br>
	most (if not all) of it wound up on the only Butcher CD I don't own,<br>
	'Big Questions (Gift of Music II)'. If anyone sees this for sale, LET ME <br>
	KNOW! We can work something out. When I went to England this summer, this<br>
	disc was my #1 priority, and I searched high and low with no luck.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> martins wedding &amp; more
	<p>
	hello all!<br>
	<br>
	i was in chicago this weekend for the occasion of martin stebbings wedding.<br>
	martin was the producer of _cult of the basement_ and was the soundman<br>
	for the past two tours.<br>
	<br>
	in no particular order:<br>
	<br>
	the only conspirator present was paul mulreany, who was the best man.<br>
	i met a couple more zanies like myself who met the guys on tour -<br>
	and so i have more bootlegs to offer soon.  in particular is a 1986<br>
	chicago soundboard tape - from the master!  i heard it and it sounds great!<br>
	i should be receiving mine next week.<br>
	<br>
	i have just bought a DAT recorder, and martin has promised me possession<br>
	of the 1990 california DATs.  he will be on tour with KMFDM for the next<br>
	month or so.  after *that*, i hope to have them in my hands to make tapes<br>
	from..  martin on tour as soundman for KMFDM.  hmmm.  he said that ian<br>
	ohiggins (the engineer of _fishcotheque_) will also be on tour.  ian,<br>
	apparently a leach of life, a totally disgusting fellow, will hopefully<br>
	will lose an eyebrow to martins razor the last night on tour.<br>
	<br>
	i also met martins younger brother francis, who is (was) the drummer<br>
	for the group the wolfhounds, who are well worth checking out, by the way.<br>
	unfortunately, they have recently broken up.  their catalogue is available on<br>
	midnight records.<br>
	<br>
	paul, even though he is officially the blue aeroplanes drummer, is<br>
	not sure yet if he wants the job.  something about not wanting to be on the<br>
	road forever - the BA begin a worldwide tour within months.<br>
	the new BA album is completed and paul had a tape of it in chicago.<br>
	<br>
	pat was in the states with the BA for awhile but is back home where,<br>
	it is said, life is not treating him very nicely.  the home front is<br>
	very shakey and he no longer has a band.  mr congeniality in depression.<br>
	yikes!  lets hope he weathers this one as well as he did in 86-87...<br>
	<br>
	a new creation records video compliation has the vid for _spooky_.<br>
	available at reckless records in chicago.  pricey though, ($26), so<br>
	i passed on it.<br>
	<br>
	i picked up the new JBC compilation, _edwards closet_.  non-essential<br>
	stuff here folks.  all 10 tracks are available elsewhere:<br>
	mr odd, the best way, spooky, pineapple tuesday, keeping the curtains closed,<br>
	shes on drugs, line of death, girl-go, susie, the good ones.<br>
	the photos on the back are basically one per of the JBC since fishcotheque.<br>
	i took the one of paul at top.  the dominant picture of kizzie holding a<br>
	bottle of champagne and staring at the camera, paired with the last tune<br>
	on the disc - _the good ones_ - paint a very sobering end to this JBC disc.<br>
	<br>
	a small pause for kizzie here..<br>
	<br>
	-david<br>
	&quot;man and machine in the night keep driving<br>

	&quot;Space Rage&quot; -- a C-grade space western.<br>
	<br>
	Yeah!  I saw &quot;Space Rage&quot; in November '87.  I was visiting my sister,<br>
	and we rented it since it looked like a good junky movie.  I was<br>
	flabbergasted when I heard the JBC songs.  <br>
	<br>
	It was especially remarkable for me because I had spent the weekend<br>
	before with my then-new boyfriend (hi Craig!), and he had given me a<br>
	complete introduction to the JBC that weekend (I think Angels and<br>
	Human Jungle were the only two JBC songs I had known before I met Craig).<br>
	I don't think I would have remembered that movie if I had seen it a<br>
	month earlier....<br>

	<p>
	hello everyone.  been pretty quiet out there.<br>
	pretty quiet here too...<br>
	<br>
	whats (kinda) new:<br>
	<br>
	i picked up the 1990 creation video comp a couple of weekends ago.<br>
	it has the video for _spooky_ on it.  geez.  maybe the JBC could<br>
	have a higher profile if they actually *spent* something on their videos.<br>
	this one is pretty much a &quot;stand in front of viedo camera and do our song&quot;<br>
	type of vid, with a low-tech 16 hue separation overall.  ick!  the<br>
	my bloody valentine video is good though.<br>
	<br>
	um..  creation has been putting out a slew of comps recently.  the latest<br>
	is entitled _a palace in the sun_ which contains _shes on drugs_.<br>
	i still recommend the dance music compilation - it has some good and<br>
	obscure bands worth tracking down.  richard formbys telescopes have<br>
	been prolific this last year - about 5 eps they have released.<br>
	<br>
	on pat:  word out is that he *is* recording new stuff with (at least) paul.<br>
	Nth-hand news says that a latest song(?) is entitled _thirteen_.<br>
	no new info of his &quot;solo US tour&quot; though..<br>
	<br>
	mr fish shows up on (the latest?) release, _pluto_, from the german crazoid<br>
	band named m walking on the water, on a song called _love_.  oh my god is<br>
	this a great tune.  the credit claims &quot;written with jazz butcher and nikki<br>
	sudden&quot; - a collaboration of which i entirely approve.  two nice drinking<br>
	woman-are-bad-news song writers :-) (thanks alex!)  this tune is in your<br>
	face rock-n-roll, full of emotion: &quot;i dont love her i dont care i dont love<br>
	her i dont care i dont love her i dont care...&quot;.<br>

	&gt; occurred..<br>
	<br>
	nope. not the lastest release. the first album was self-titled,<br>
	`pluto' was the 2nd album.<br>
	after that came `the waltz', a 6-track mini-lp with nothing but waltzes <br>
	on it, and `elysian', which came out this year. <br>
	*all* of them are chock-full with weirdness, great tunes and crazy <br>
	instrumentation.  all of them are on fuego, distributed by rough trade,<br>
	with the exception of the last, which came out on polygram. <br>
	i don't know whether the non-europeans on this list (all except me?) will<br>
	get ahold of this stuff ... if you can, do.<br>
	<br>
	i saw them live twice in the last few weeks, once in munich and once in vienna.<br>
	*fun* time for all the family. i would forward the review i sent to david<br>
	after i saw them, but the disk that file is on was fried in a *really* <br>
	bad crash ... did any of the unix-hackers among <br>
	you ever see the kernel error message `panic: init died'? well, i did. <br>
	i taped the vienna show, but the batteries ran out after slightly<br>
	over an hour. wellwell. don't trust electronic equipment :-|.<br>

	Grrrrrr . . . stupid site administrator is right!  I've been trying to post<br>

	I was re-listening to Big Questions the other night when a thought struck me<br>
	(No, it didn't hurt.  I'm used to it.  One of the hazards of modern<br>
	living . . . ): the song, &quot;The Hairbrush And The Tank.&quot;  There's a song<br>
	on David J's album, Crocodile Tears And The Velvet Cosh, called &quot;The<br>
	Vandal And The Saint&quot; that's got the same identical music and rhyme<br>

	or so but still . . . what's the deal here?  What's the story behind<br>
	these two songs?  Which came first (I suspect David's came first but<br>
	I don't know the release date of the single that &quot;Hairbrush&quot; appeared<br>

	you guessed it right.  _the vandal and the saint_ was<br>
	the original.  i asked pat about the obvious rip-off once<br>
	and he said that he was just listening to _vandal_ and he<br>
	heard the line: &quot;sharing a room with the butcher&quot; hmmmmm...<br>
	it inspired him to poke fun at david j, who is his good friend.<br>
	he said that he had written an earlier version which more<br>
	closely parodied the _vandal_ lyrics, but he lost them.<br>
	<br>
	this conversation is on a 90minute interview tape from<br>
	milwaukee 1989,  but i dont have a copy right now. (nancy? :-)<br>
	<br>
	during the same inquisition, mr fish also was telling about<br>
	the song _the partys over_ from the david j 1985 album _on glass_.<br>
	they both had to get fall-down drunk to do it right.<br>
	i asked him whether he thought david j wanted to do that<br>
	duet as a sort of good-bye-to-the-JBC tribute.  pat, speechless<br>
	(for once) paused and then said &quot;my god, i hadnt thought of that&quot;<br>
	<br>
	it is still a little strange to listen to the newest david j<br>
	album and hear, basically, the jbc lineup from 1985 minus pat.<br>
	<br>
	has anyone noticed how much early woodentops sound like<br>
	early jazz butcher?  rolo mcginty *was* in the JBC once,<br>
	i guess, but come on!  must be something in the northampton water.<br>

	<p>
	Dear Abby,<br>
	<br>
	I am a healthy, attractive 35 year old housewife.  Until about two weeks ago<br>
	my life was happy and normal.  Now, frankly, it is a living hell.  I can't sleet<br>
	(that's sleep), I can't eat, and I can barely function in my day-to-day duties.<br>
	<br>
	The problem started when I was looking through my son Biff's desk.  I found all <br>
	these computer printouts about something called the JBC.  In one of those print-<br>
	outs was a listing of JBC songs, and two of these songs (City of Night and It<br>

	an Richman song &quot;Affection&quot; being on that album.  I told my husband about it,<br>
	and he said that, no, the Jazz Butcher never covered that song.  I insisted that<br>
	I was right, but he continued to argue with me.  Finally, I got so flustered<br>
	with him that I stabbed him through the back of his skull with one of those<br>
	wonder-ful Ginsu Knives that my Aunt Flo got me for our wedding.  (Incidentally,<br>

	Hello. I just got new mail from David J - seems he's joined a new band called<br>
	(to the best of my handwriting deciphering abilities) Rose Meddow. The rose bit<br>
	is certain but it could be mildew for all I could tell. He didn't mention who<br>
	else is in the band, but said it was spiritual, uplifting kind of stuff. He adde<br>
	${icon_blank}   d that Love and Rockets are still an existing thing and that they're thinking<br>
	about recording in the not too distant future. So get those antenni going and<br>
	lets see who else might be in this band. I think he would have said if it were<br>
	max. Maybe it will be Spacement 3 type folk. Y'never know with those damn<br>
	Northamptonites.<br>
	<br>
	Has anyone else noticed an increase in bicycle kids in their neighborhoods<br>
	recently. They come out like the mosquitos I think.<br>
	<br>

	isnt this the way it always is?  the best performances<br>
	are captured by an audience recording and the soundboard<br>
	tapes are dry and lifeless?  well, this one is a draw.<br>
	<br>
	right.  perfect digital reproduction of a mix that is bass<br>
	and guitar shy.  vocals and drums up front.  with some<br>
	smancy EQ, i think this tape can be pretty good though.<br>
	<br>
	this is a long show with a killer _caroline wheeler_.<br>
	_sister death_ is in there, _angels_ too.<br>
	<br>
	anyone interested in copies?<br>
	<br>
	joel!  its looking like your FM capture of the 1989 KCRW interview<br>

	&gt; Date: Tue, 14 May 91 12:33:28 EST<br>
	&gt; this conversation is on a 90minute interview tape from<br>
	&gt; milwaukee 1989,  but i dont have a copy right now. (nancy? :-)<br>
	<br>
	Sorry to take so long to respond, but Craig and I have been &quot;on<br>
	holiday&quot;, as they say.  Yes, I indeed have the aforementioned<br>
	interview on tape, thanks to David.  Tell you guys what -- within<br>
	the next month, I hope to get completely caught up on my tape<br>
	trading activities, and update my bootleg lists (I'm over a year<br>
	behind on that).  When I do that, I'll post the list, and start<br>
	actively trading JBC tapes.<br>
	<br>
	In the meantime, I actually have some JBC news!<br>
	<br>
	Craig and I recently discovered we like The Wedding Present, and as we were<br>
	heading over to Paris and England for a well-deserved 18 day vacation, Craig<br>
	said, &quot;Wouldn't it be great if we could see the Wedding Present?&quot;  I agreed.<br>
	<br>
	Turns out they were doing a small tour, and we got to see them last Saturday<br>
	at the Brixton Academy in London (Buffalo Tom opened).  It was a really good<br>
	show, though a bit short - 50 minutes, no encore.  I had brought my Cult<br>
	of the Basement tour shirt on the trip, and wore it that night.  After the<br>
	show, a guy came up to me and asked me if I liked the Jazz Butcher.  He was<br>
	astounded that he found someone in England who did, but then he found out<br>
	we're Americans, and wasn't so surprised.  Anyway, it turns out this guy<br>
	does graphic art stuff for Creation Records, and he said that he'd just<br>
	finished up some stuff for a new record.  He told us the title, but I didn't<br>
	quite hear it, and can't remember now.  The only thing I really remember is<br>
	something about some weird German stuff on the liner notes, and something<br>
	being attributed to &quot;von Butcher&quot;.  He said it should be available within<br>
	the next two months. <br>
	<br>
	Sorry for the lack of details, but after two pints of cider and being bounced<br>
	around in the pit for three or four songs, I wasn't in complete possession<br>
	of my faculties at the time.<br>
	<br>
	The guy (Pete Mays, I think) promised to send me some information about a <br>
	fan club, and remarked that he has some &quot;really good&quot; bootlegs, so I'll let<br>
	you know more when I hear from him.<br>
	<br>
	So Craig, if you can fill in any details, please do so!<br>

	<p>
	Anyone else besides Craig and Nancy and me like the Wedding<br>
	Present?  I have many excellent quality tapes of Wedding Present<br>
	shows.  The best is probably from Lounge Ax in Chicago last<br>
	February.  Their new single is pretty good, and if the material<br>
	they played at their last Chicago show is any indication of<br>
	the quality of their new album (due to be out this week, I hear)<br>
	it probably won't leave my turntable until &quot;The Black Egg&quot;<br>
	comes out.<br>
	<br>
	Speaking of Von Butcher...<br>
	<br>
	Reverend Botus just gave me yet another KCRW tape with <br>
	a sort of mix of JBC, Blue Aeroplanes, and various combinations<br>
	of the two.  It was recorded the day that Thatcher resigned,<br>
	and contains the one JBC hardcore song entitled &quot;You Cunt&quot;, andf<br>
	dedicated to Mrs. Thatcher.  Pat did not want it recorded, and<br>
	Martin assured him that the tape player was off.  It also has a <br>
	n acoustic &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; with Pat and Gerard, three or four attempts<br>
	at &quot;Crocodile Tears&quot; with just Pat and Alex Green, and lots of<br>
	very short covers of really bad 70's songs.  For me, the highlight<br>
	is when they are attempting a cover of a song called &quot;If&quot;(?) and<br>
	pat sings &quot;If a face can launch a thousand ships, then why can't<br>
	I launch you...&quot;  I vaguely remember the song, but I don't think<br>
	that that is the line.  Pretty sick stuff.<br>

	<br>
	speaking of the spacemen 3... joe, i found a copy of<br>
	the new sonic boom 7&quot;er.  very tasteful clear mixed with<br>
	yellow and blue vinyl.  the label is: sympathy for the record<br>
	industry, and the label says &quot;play at any speed&quot;.<br>
	its a geetar drone-thang.  would sound good with a nice<br>

	hey!!!!<br>
	i was at that show, and i was told that the sound guy forgot to press <br>
	${icon_blank} record onthe deck...<br>
	<br>
	a wonderful show...<br>
	<br>
	during that version of crocodile tears, which was intro'ed as &quot;i think this<br>
	${icon_blank} a bob dylan song&quot; (and no-one recognized it 'cept me, it seemed :) ) pat<br>
	${icon_blank} had a garbage can lowered onto his head by the rest of the guys. most amusing<br>
	<br>
	and caroline wheelers was *incredible* (and it was 6 guitarist, as<br>
	${icon_blank} i recall)... sweet jane was done with 7 or so...)<br>
	<br>
	if you can get this on tape, talk to me. i want it for the memories! :)<br>

	<br>
	the master is prolly of good enough quality to cut an official live<br>

	I just talked to Martin who just got a message from Pat.  I guess<br>
	that the new JBC album is ready for shipment, since Julian just<br>
	sent Martin a cd of it.  I guess the incarnation of the JBC from the<br>

	<br>
	I don't think that it is called &quot;The Black Eg&quot; though.  I think that<br>
	maybe the guy that Nancy talked to in England got the band<br>
	&quot;The Black Eg&quot; which is produced by Pat confused with the new<br>
	JBC album.  I mean the album by &quot;The Black Eg&quot; has a black cover<br>
	and makes veiled references to the Jazz Butcher.  But there <br>
	definitely is a new JBC album, and for all I know it could be out<br>
	right now.  I'm tempted to make a call to Creation to find out the<br>
	release date.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> chat with pat
	<p>
	i spoke with pat over the weekend and the butcher man hasnt<br>
	been doing too well.  i may transcribe highlights of our conversation,<br>
	but in summary:<br>
	<br>
	o	yes!  the new album has been completed, and it is &quot;cult of<br>
	${icon_blank}	the basement 2.&quot;  julian, alex lee (of the aeroplanes) and<br>
	${icon_blank}	laurence (!) play guitar.  paul is still playing drums<br>
	${icon_blank}	(at least in the studio).  about a dozen musicians showed up on it<br>
	${icon_blank}	and he was fretting over the credits when we talked.<br>
	<br>
	o	pat has been playing small shows in london which he describes as<br>
	${icon_blank}	being &quot;very spacemen&quot;.  lots and lots of delay and very little<br>
	${icon_blank}	beat.  he is very proud of this latest sound, but has yet to<br>
	${icon_blank}	record it for release.<br>
	<br>
	o	next week he will be recording an EP with richard formby.<br>
	${icon_blank}	so perhaps he *is* about to record the new sound, as richard<br>
	${icon_blank}	has been producing the telescopes and other grunge bands.<br>
	<br>
	o	the tour.  nothing definite, but possibly before december.<br>
	${icon_blank}	even then, he is not sure what he wants to perform - the traditional<br>
	${icon_blank}	new cult material or the new stuff he has been doing.<br>
	${icon_blank}	he is going to be over in the states visiting in august.<br>
	<br>
	o	pat had just returned from the west coast where he did some<br>
	${icon_blank}	vocal work with the blue aeroplanes.  he is almost certain,<br>
	${icon_blank}	however that all his stuff will be cut.<br>
	<br>
	o	the Black Eg.  all the delay effects on the Black Eg record are pats<br>
	${icon_blank}	guitar delay pedal before it blew up upon his return to england<br>
	${icon_blank}	in january.  so he calls the Black Eg alum the &quot;solo record for<br>
	${icon_blank}	my guitar pedal&quot;.  apparently, the guitar pedal wasnt the only<br>
	${icon_blank}	thing to go to pieces in january.  he laughed manically at the thought<br>
	${icon_blank}	that he recorded during this time.  in england, the Black Eg<br>
	${icon_blank}	record is plastered with &quot;Von Jazz Butcher&quot; stickers.  pat wanted<br>
	${icon_blank}	his involvement not to be known, so the stickers pissed him off.<br>
	${icon_blank}	the A C Lionheart (ha!) who wrote the liner notes is, of course, pat.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	thats all i can remember right now.<br>
	off on a road trip to philadelphia in about an hour, i will<br>
	see if there is anything i forgot when i get back.<br>
	<br>
	happy 5th of july.<br>

	<p>
	I have been asked to introduce myself and say a bit about the Jazz Butcher in<br>
	Australia. My name is David Cake, I'm a cognitive science student, and I also<br>
	am an announcer for the local public radio station 6RTR. The Jazz Butcher in<br>
	Australia is easy - hes never been here, and no one has eever heard of him.<br>
	${icon_blank}	The alternative music shows on public radio were the only place he was<br>
	ever heard until recently. Just recently the government funded national youth<br>
	broadcaster JJJ (who are amazingly cool for a government body, we are real <br>
	strange over here) have picked up 'shes on drugs` 'girl go` etc. so he gets<br>
	vastly more exposure here now, but all the older stuff is virtually unknown.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Jazz Butcher records have always been quite hard to get here. That has<br>
	improved a bit since hes been on Creation, and a lot since Creation got a good<br>
	australian distributor (Shock Records).<br>
	${icon_blank}	To summarise, JBC have always been very little known here until the<br>
	last six months. They are now reasonably well known.<br>
	<br>
	David Cake<br>
	<br>
	P.S. I'd love some back posts.<br>

	<p>
	stewart asks:<br>
	&gt; ...anybody have any idea where I might<br>
	&gt; lay my hands on the &quot;Spooky&quot; Canadian CD-single (or equivalent 12&quot;, if<br>
	&gt; there is one...I think I remember del saying there was).  I tried <br>
	&gt; ordering it from a local store about a year or so ago, but no luck...<br>
	<br>
	i havent seen many in *my* part of the world (midwest USofA) in awhile,<br>
	but that particular release, being canadian, is pretty easy to get<br>
	in the toronto area.  can anyone help stewart out with this one?<br>
	<br>
	a note about the spooky 12&quot; - it does NOT include all the tastey<br>
	&quot;brave new waves&quot; studio session songs that the CD does.  plus,<br>
	and this is uncommon - the 12er sounds worse than the CD.  usually,<br>
	the vinyl version of creation releases have a better dynamic range<br>
	than their shaving mirror counterparts.<br>
	<br>
	dangerous rumour:  deerkiller reports that a friend in NYC has spotted<br>
	a &quot;new&quot; JBC release.  its possible that she just saw _edwards closet_,<br>
	but everyone should be on the lookout anyway.<br>
	<br>
	since speaking with mr fish over a month ago, i have heard not a peep.<br>
	martin reports as of two weeks ago that pat was in ireland.<br>
	its getting to be that time of year again.  i hope the JBC wheels<br>
	roll soon.<br>
	<br>
	how has everyone been?  gagged?<br>

	<p>
	i just talked with my friend scott in new jersey.<br>
	over the weekend, scott called pat and discussed things.  in summary:<br>
	<br>
	pat just came back from the west coast where he<br>
	OPENED FOR ROBYN HITCHCOCK.<br>
	ok, ladies and gents - why wasnt this general knowledge?  back from the<br>
	land of bliss, scott said pat seemed in a really good mood.<br>
	<br>
	the new album was expected to be released in the UK in about<br>
	*3 weeks*, which doesnt not jibe with the Reckless Records Chicago story.<br>
	he didnt even know what the cover would look like.  it seems things were<br>
	held up because they had to call him to check the song credits..<br>
	&quot;WHO else would get credit for this?&quot;  expect a record full of long<br>
	_pineapple tuesday_-esqueness.  fine with *me*.<br>
	richard formby appears on guitar again, alex green on sax.<br>
	<br>
	upcoming for the poppets in france:  pat will be touring there around the<br>
	20th of october.  i may try to get european tour dates out of him myself<br>
	so that the '91 tour is documented (right, joe?)<br>
	bad news for the rest of us - he does NOT have a US tour planned as of last<br>
	weekend.  he said that he may hold out until next summer.<br>
	<br>
	other things..  he loves the new primal scream album (on creation, naturally).<br>
	paul mulreany is playing drums for the blue aeroplanes.  richard formby<br>
	is still working with sonic from the spacemen 3.<br>
	<br>
	second hand news, i know, but news nonetheless..<br>

	<p>
	My name is Arik Florimonte, i've been a fan since about summer '88... and<br>
	fortuneately there was a large backlog of jbc music to keep myself amused,<br>
	bnut lately i have felt a loss of good things to come from the man...<br>
	I have all the import and domestic albums, except bathofbacon, which i will very<br>
	shortly be able to tape, i'm set there.  I don't have any of his singles, but<br>
	if i'm not mistaken, many of those songs have been on complilations.(?)<br>
	my favourite album would have to be DistressedGF.  I missed a chance to see the<br>
	jbc on their fishcotheque tour, but saw them on their bpsp tour, and passed on<br>
	the cult of the b. tour, although i had originally planned to follow them around<br>
	california. it just fell through.<br>
	When i saw them at the Roxy in hollywood on the bpsp tour, my friends and i<br>
	managed to hang around and meet Lawrence O'Keefe and get on the guest list the<br>
	following night.  That was certainly a high point, although a lot of it has<br>
	faded from memory.  I remember him being fascinated by the Lakers and saying<br>
	that the next album was going to be the really good, one, no, not the next one<br>
	but the one after that.  I hope he didn't mean Edward's closet (what a ripoff.)<br>
	We realized later that we came very close to being invited to stay at their<br>
	hotel with them.  We told Lawrence that we had driven down from Santa Cruz to<br>
	see them and LA and he was concerned that we didn't have a place to stay. we of<br>
	course didn't think to say no, and told him we were sleeping in the car.<br>
	I always wondered what would have happened.<br>
	<br>

	I just spoke with Herr Fish.  According to him, the new album should be <br>
	available here within days as an import, and by January as a domestic<br>
	release.  Two american record companies are fighting over the rights to<br>
	it, I guess.  He has been away working with a band called The Love Kittens.<br>
	They do a cover of Angels.  While they were doing the cover of Angels,<br>
	the singer fell ill, and Pat was forced to finish the vocals.<br>
	<br>
	The new type of music that he has been performing in France, and will be<br>
	performing in Spain and Germany in the next few months is called<br>
	&quot;Gothic Techno-folk&quot; and consists of him and a guitar player and a <br>
	saxophonist (i.e. Alex).  Oh yeah, and a drum machine.  He said he was really<br>
	pleased because they could just get on a train and ride around and not have<br>
	to worry about a drum kit.  Speaking of drummers, both Paul and Mr. Jones<br>
	play on the new album.  <br>
	<br>
	15 people played on the new album, and he said that he was considering calling<br>
	the band &quot;The Jazz Butcher Anti-Sonic Tabernacle&quot;.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> hello and stuff.
	<p>
	I was thinking, the most exciting mail i get are the ones from the jbcfanclub,<br>
	so i thought i'd add my two bits to the discussion.<br>
	<br>
	first, you all probably have access to this, but I have a tape of David J., Max,<br>
	&amp; op jones on &lt;snap&gt; KCRW Los Angelese from two summers ago.  It's taped off<br>
	the air and not necessarily that interesting, but it is MORE STUFF.<br>
	I think they do 'fingers in the grease', 'the grass is always greener' and (i<br>
	think) a (john cale?) cover-- 'antarctica starts here'.<br>
	<br>
	Also, i've got a friend in my dorm who's convinced that he's going to be the<br>
	next guitar player for the JBC.  He wants me to send notice along to butch of<br>
	that.  I used to think i was going to be their next bass player...<br>
	And that got me to thinking, that probably a lot of us have musical talents.  I<br>
	realize that with our small number that you aren't likely to live around here,<br>
	but i'm just itchin' to play some tunes since my old band just broke up.<br>
	unlikely, but if in Santa Cruz, CA area, email frendli@cats.ucsc.edu.<br>
	<br>
	I've taken up enough bytes, methinks.<br>
	And be sure to pass it along to Pat if you see him that there is a guitarist<br>
	(and a bassist) here that would do nicely.<br>

	<p>
	Well, I just picked up &quot;Condition Blue&quot; this weekend.  Nine songs, 55 minutes.<br>
	Those of you with calculators can average it out.  But anyway, the songs are <br>
	looooooooong.  I am going to reserve judgement on it until later in the week,<br>
	as is our gracious host Devoid (who zipped up here from Purdue when he heard<br>
	that I had found it).  My reason is that JBC albums usually take a while to <br>
	grow on me.  There are three songs on the new album that totally blew me away,<br>
	and there is only one that I can say that I really don't like, and there are <br>
	some tracks that are difficult at first listen.  But then again, I was really<br>
	ambivalent about Distressed Gentlefolk, Fishcotecqhe, BigScarey, and Cult O'<br>
	the Basement the first time I heard them as well.  So both Devoid and I are <br>
	going to give it several more listens before we actually post a real review.<br>
	I'd really like to hear what anyone else who manages to stumble onto it has<br>
	to say about it.  But it is definitely worth getting, even if it is just for<br>
	&quot;Racheland&quot;.  Later, y'all.<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> BEAULIEU-JOE &lt;beaulieu@norcmail.uchicago.edu&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC Retrospective Radio Show
	<p>
	Yeah, I pretty much agree with you about the old stuff.  Girlfriend, Next Move,<br>
	Angels, Southern Mark Smith (both versions), and Olof Palme all make my list<br>
	of the songs to put on the show.  The one thing that I have not yet decided is<br>
	if I should play the record versions or live versions of the songs in question.<br>
	If I play the live version of Angels, I will play the one on the 1989 Chicago<br>
	tape.  (Did David get that one to you?)  But, I also have a 1986 version with<br>
	Max on guitar and a 1990 version with Julian on guitar.  The same goes for <br>
	Southern Mark Smith and Girlfriend (but I don't think that they did it on the <br>
	1989 tour).  The first thing that I am going to have to do is play all of the<br>
	JBC tapes that I have and write down set lists, and then pick the songs that I<br>
	want to play and then listen to each version and decide which one I like best at<br>
	that particular moment.<br>
	<br>
	Now, about Condition Blue...<br>
	<br>
	Racheland is the Butcher at his best.  The rest of the album I have some (minor)<br>
	problems with.  In general, the songwriting is top notch (with the exception of<br>
	Honey, which I cannot stand).  But some of it is just too produced(?), maybe.<br>
	Case in point - the background vocals at the end of Harlan.  And the background<br>
	vocals in Girls Say Yes, which is a terrific song otherwise (and maybe despite<br>
	the background vocals).  Shirley is really cool.  Monkeyface I can take or leave<br>
	.  I don't think I like She's a Yo-Yo.  The song with the weird sax bit at the<br>
	beginning would have been a lot better if it had been less produced.<br>
	<br>
	So all-in-all, I would have to give the album as a whole an extremely reluctant<br>
	thumb down.  I mean, I would definitely reccommend it to anyone familiar with<br>
	with JBC if only on the merits of Racheland, Girls Say Yes, and Harlan.  But I<br>
	think that this would be a poor introduction to the JBC.<br>
	<br>
	But I think that the stuff on this record is going to be really amazing live, <br>
	when the songs are going to be really stripped down and concentrate on the<br>
	songwriting and the melodies and all of the things that I love the most about<br>
	Pat's songs.  But the truth is that for the last two albums (BigScarey, <br>
	Basement, and this one) I have not been that particularly fond of a lot of the<br>
	songs until I heard them live.<br>
	<br>
	Now I feel kind of bad because I feel like I am being over-critical.  I guess<br>
	what I am trying to get at is this:  the songs are definitely there, but it<br>
	seems like he is having trouble getting them from the instruments and onto the<br>
	medium without the production getting in the way.  One really notable exception<br>
	to this is &quot;Onion Field&quot; off of Basement.  That is a really terrific song, and<br>
	the production is so tastefully done that you don't even notice it.  Compare <br>
	that to the song on &quot;C.B.&quot; with the sax thing at the beginning whose name I can<br>
	never remember (you know, the one that goes &quot;did you think you were doing me a<br>
	favor...&quot;).  On that one, the production is just too overdone for my taste.<br>
	<br>
	But, I definitely agree with you about the songs themselves.  For me, though,<br>
	the entire record revolves around Racheland, Girls Say Yes, and Harlan.<br>
	<br>
	So, am I being too harsh and over-critical?  I would definitely like to hear<br>
	what other people think about this.<br>

	&gt; Are there any really good guitar solos on it?<br>
	<br>
	in the sense that a spacemen 3 record would have a really good guitar solo.<br>
	as deerkiller pointed out, the songs are rather _onion field_-ish in feel,<br>
	with a guitar &quot;presence&quot; more than a guitar lead.  _shes a yo-yo_ (which is<br>
	my least fave track) is traditional staight up no chaser rock ala<br>
	_line o death_.<br>
	<br>
	i *like* the over-production, especially on _filth_ with female backup<br>
	and crowd screams mixed in.  pat is experimenting and even if the results<br>
	are not perfect, they are listenable and a new approach to the 'D' chord.<br>
	he has grown musically since _big planet_.  isnt that what its about?<br>
	<br>
	deeklicker is right.  _racheland_ is a fabulous &quot;my cat was just squashed<br>
	by a car right in front of me&quot; song of lost lurve and desparation and<br>
	determination.  emotionally complex as _angels_.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; any potential classics that groups of drunk people will howl together<br>
	&gt; at parties while desparately hanging on one another?<br>
	<br>
	the entire album.  honestly.  i find that i can put it on and let it<br>
	work into my brain where it finds a nice niche that says &quot;lets get drunk<br>
	and cry some, if theres a shoulder i will take, if not, fuck off&quot;.<br>
	the album has a mood unlike any of the other recent albums.<br>
	i recommend it soley on that fact.<br>
	did that answer your question?<br>

	<p>
	Yeah, that's kind of gross, but that is what it looks like at 4 AM after too<br>
	much vodka.  But, to the point...<br>
	<br>
	Maybe I was a little to harsh on the production of Condition Blue, but I still<br>
	think that some of my criticism is warrented.  Those last 10 seconds of Harlan,<br>
	with the loud echoy sighing background vocals really bugs me.  A friend of mine<br>
	put it best when she said, &quot;what's this? fuckin' Christmas music?&quot;.  But it is<br>
	still a great tune, and I can't seem to get it out of my head today, esp. the<br>
	part where he keeps singing &quot;you know all about it, you know all about it...&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	I think that I am going to call pat this weekend and try to set up a time to<br>
	do the phone interview thing for the radio show.  Between now and the time I<br>
	do the interview I have to decide what I am going to play so I can ask him about<br>
	the specific songs.  In the interview I am going to concentrate on old songs and<br>
	on his future plans.  I will try to avoid talking about the songs on this record<br>
	.  I can see it now:<br>
	<br>
	Q- So, what insprired you to write Racheland?<br>
	A- Well, I got divorced, had a nervous breakdown, and I was contemplating<br>
	${icon_blank}   death.<br>
	<br>
	Q- And what inspired you to write &quot;Still and All&quot;?<br>
	A- Well, I got divorced, had a nervous breakdown, and I was contemplating<br>
	${icon_blank}   death.<br>
	<br>
	Q- And what about &quot;Harlan&quot;<br>
	<br>
	...and so on.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	On my radio show this week, I played something off of Asylum Road by the<br>
	Perfect Disaster.  It completely blew away anything I had heard by them<br>
	before, and the song I played sounded like a blueprint for Girl Go.<br>
	<br>
	And speaking of Girl Go, I guess there won't be a single this time around.<br>
	But if there was 1) what would it be, and 2) what SHOULD it be.  The only<br>
	reason I ask is that I remember David saying that Pineapple Tuesday should have<br>
	been the single off of Basement.  I think it should have been Sister Death.<br>

	Later...<br>

	I have heard the new album and I don't think it is good as the<br>
	previous albums. People may agree that:<br>
	<br>
	- the songs will probably be brilliant live<br>
	- the guy has gone through a hard time, and<br>
	- we will all be looking forward to the new (i.e., the one after<br>
	${icon_blank}  Condition Blue) album<br>
	<br>
	I'll double your two cents.....<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> BEAULIEU-JOE &lt;beaulieu@norcmail.uchicago.edu&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Let's be fair
	<p>
	Alright folks,<br>
	<br>
	I think that I have been harping just a little too much on what I don't like<br>
	about condition blue.  Now, for the people who haven't heard it yet, this kind<br>
	of sucks because when they listen to it for the first time they will listen for<br>
	all the bad stuff that people have been telling them about.  So today, I am<br>
	to post an incomplete list of things that I love about the rekkerd.<br>
	<br>
	1)  The beautiful guitar line on &quot;Girls Say Yes&quot;.  Especially on the part where<br>
	he is singing &quot;She takes you to the movies/she knows that you never ever go&quot;.<br>
	Perfect.<br>
	<br>
	2)  The lyrics on the serious songs.  I think that I would toss &quot;Shirley&quot;<br>
	and &quot;She's a Yo-Yo&quot; in the same bin as &quot;Line of Death&quot; and &quot;Panic in Room 109&quot;.<br>
	Except that I do kind of like &quot;Shirley&quot;.  But the lyrics on &quot;Still and All&quot;,<br>
	&quot;Racheland&quot; (worship! worship!), &quot;Harlan&quot;, and &quot;Gorrilas Say Yes&quot; really do<br>
	blow me away.<br>
	<br>
	3)  Even the two techno-sampling tunes &quot;Monkeyface&quot; and &quot;Our Friends the Filth&quot;<br>
	have a lot going for them.  Monkeyface is obviously a continuation of &quot;Basement&quot;<br>
	and would do really well as the theme music for a cheesy cold-war spy thriller<br>
	set in some third-world country.  Our Friends the Filth is like the Black Eg<br>
	with a big budget and taken to its logical conclusion.  I am starting to really<br>
	like some of the tracks on Black Eg, by the way.<br>
	<br>
	4) The music on most of the songs is really good as well.  Examples:<br>
	When the distorted guitar on &quot;Racheland&quot; kicks in, I get serious chills.  And<br>
	how at the end the tempo picks up and it turns into a big distorted mess.<br>
	<br>
	And the guitars on &quot;Shirley&quot; are really cool when you are in that kind of mood.<br>
	And the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate &quot;Harlan&quot; and the less the<br>
	background vocals annoy me.<br>
	So what I would suggest is that you buy it, tape the songs that you like, and<br>
	then pretend that it is a really awesome ep.  And wait for the next one.<br>

	<p>
	it seems that since bpsp i've been saying oh well, wait for the next one.  NO.<br>
	i am determined to like this one.  I have noticed something about record buying,<br>
	and that's that if you are anticipating a new album, it never lives up to your<br>
	expectations.  The best ones are the ones that you hear here and there until<br>
	they grow on you, even if it's a band you already love.<br>
	${icon_blank}  Sooo.... i'm not going to buy it anytime soon  (i have no choice, i can't<br>
	FIND it anywhere), and when i do, i'll be really nice to it, maybe chat with it<br>
	over a cold one, pass no judgements.. etc.<br>
	<br>
	The other thing... I'm here in the SantaCruz area, and last night at a local<br>
	21and over place there were two bands (neither headlining) playing.<br>
	They were called 'The Butchers' and 'The Best Kissers in the World'.  I think<br>
	the other band was called 'urj'.  Anyone ever hear of them before? I didn't get<br>
	down to see the show, though i was very curious.<br>
	<br>
	YA KNOW?<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Trivia
	<p>
	Just had breakfast with the Reverend Botus Whiteblood Fleming (or, as he now<br>
	calls himself, Reg Bogus or Vlad the Inhaler, Infamous Boozehound of the East).<br>
	He is leaving for Germany on Friday to record KMFDM.  And he just recorded<br>
	GERARDO!  Not Geraldo, GERARDO!  You know &quot;RICO SUAVE&quot;!  And he left the<br>
	master tapes in my apartment for about an hour.  I feel so proud.<br>
	<br>
	And I jokingly asked him if GERARDO left his shirt on while he was recording<br>
	(in his crappy videos he never wears a shirt).  And the answer was no!  Martin<br>
	said that it was 50 degrees in the studio, and everyone else was wearing their<br>
	coats, and this bozo refused to put his shirt on.<br>
	<br>
	Help me with this logical progression-<br>
	<br>
	&gt;From the JBC to KMFDM to GERARDO to ?<br>
	<br>
	Debbie Gibson?<br>
	The New Kids on the Block?<br>
	Menudo?<br>
	<br>
	Actually, I shouldn't make fun of Martin.  It's not like he sought out<br>
	GERARDO.  Some cool bands also record at his studio.  One of these is<br>
	&quot;A Tribe Called Quest&quot;.  Sonic Boom also records with them.  But then, so<br>
	do Samantha Fox and D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.  Strange world we<br>
	live in.<br>

	So has anyone bought anything by Levitation yet?  The DJ this morning on<br>
	WZBC played a track called &quot;Squirrel&quot;, which I liked, but he said something<br>
	that surprised me -- 3 of the 5 band members are former JBC members.  I<br>
	was only aware of Laurence's presence (Cure pun, sorry) in the band.  Who<br>
	are the other two?<br>
