			<p />
			Almost everyone takes drugs for non-medical reasons - either for pleasure or to use their effects in other ways. For instance, people have drinks containing caffeine to get them going in the mornings or keep them going at night, or they have a couple of alcoholic drinks to help them wind down after work or feel relaxed in company. These habits are both legal and socially acceptable, and people who regularly drink tea, coffee or alcohol in moderation are very unlikely to think of themselves as drug users.
			<p />
			However, legal drugs such as alcohol, nicotine and even caffeine can lead to psychological dependence and physical withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine is one of the most dependence-forming of all drugs, and tobacco is one of the most damaging substances. In his book Licit and Illicit Drugs (Little, Brown 1972), Dr Vincent Dole concludes that &apos;cigarette smoking is unquestionably more damaging to the human body than heroin&apos;.
			<p />
			Alcohol also causes serious concern. According to a major government survey in 1995, about 1 in 25 adults, making a total of around 1.8 million, are dependent on it. This is more than twice the number dependent on illegal drugs. And like dependence on &apos;hard&apos; drugs such as heroin, alcohol dependence can lead to serious personal and social problems, serious damage to mental and physical health, and even death, either by overdose or through associated problems.
			<p />
			So it&apos;s hardly surprising that many people who use illegal drugs feel that double standards apply in this area - in the law, in general attitudes and in the media. An alcohol-related death scarcely rates a mention in the local paper, but an ecstasy-related death can be major national news - partly, of course, because of the very rarity of the event. An estimated 28,000–33,000 people die each year from alcohol-related causes; since 1985 the total number of deaths related to ecstasy is put at 60–70. And there&apos;s little more consistency in attitudes to drugs within the illegal categories. Deaths related to amphetamines or opiates aren&apos;t big news either, perhaps because these drugs have been around for longer than ecstasy.
			<p />
			The crusial point is that, however illegal drug users are treated by the law or perceived by other people, the experience of many is that you can smoke cannabis or even take ecstasy, amphetamines or LSD without harming yourself or anyone else. This Website isn&apos;t concerned with arguments about the legal control of different drugs. But given that a growing number of people regard taking certain illegal drugs as a normal part of their lives, and (according to the British Crime Survey 1996) 29% of the adult population have tried illegal drugs, sources of straightforward information about the effects and risks are crucial. The ABC of Drugs aims to provide one such source and tell you about the others.
