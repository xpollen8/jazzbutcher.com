			The first Masters of Budvar night of the new year falls this Friday 7th January 2005 at our regular
			venue, the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1. As usual, entry is free, the prices are
			reasonable, the artists talented, the speeches short. Three wildly disparate acts from Northampton
			Town this month.
			<p>
			${joe_woolley} and the Moon Children (onstage 10:15pm)
			<p>
			What do they like to call it? Soulful punk folk with a psychedelic edge? I bet I've got that wrong.
			Whatever, Joe's freewheeling electric band certainly does cover a lot of ground in a colourful,
			good-natured set. Skewed funk rhythms, sweet vocals and soulful electric guitar are on offer to warm
			your January night. And William Hill are open for business on where The One might be found in their
			version of "Money".
			<p>
			Mrs. Pilgrimm (onstage 9:40pm)
			<p>
			We are thrilled to snag this guest appearance by the deeply wonderful Mrs. P. This extraordinary
			artist surely needs no introduction or explanation. If you've really been away for a while, there's a
			young woman, a cello and a chair...

			Check out more at ${g_artistweb(g=http://www.mrspilgrimm.de)}
			<p>
			Big Tim Sansom (onstage 9:00pm)
			<p>
			Again, there is very little that one can say about the illustrious Big Tim, one of our town's very
			finest songwriters. His last set at Masters of Budvar was chock full of his best-loved hits, delivered
			with a growing confidence and charm. The word is that he has been recording with Mark Refoy again.
			It's good to see him back at the coalface, and it will be good to see him in the Labour Club too, so
			do get down good and early to catch him.
			<p>
			That's all at the Labour Club, this Friday 7th January 2005.
			<p>
			You have found yourself on the Masters of Budvar mailing list, an essentially well-intentioned
			information service relating to monthly knees-up events at Northampton Labour Club and occasional
			other counter-cultural bunfights. Should you at any point tire of receiving these bulletins from
			beneath the stairs, please reply to this e-mail with the phrase "Avast there, ye scurvy knaves,
			I'll have none of your drivel" in the subject field. Thank you.

			A truly surprising turn-out for the January MOB night. I had anticipated something of a
			post-festive slowdown, but instead the place was absolutely packed.Perhaps they had all heard Big
			Tim's new recording on the BBC Weekender. We listened to it huddled together in Big Tim's car
			outside the club, and it came across truly magnificent. Mark Refoy's production magic clearly in
			evidence on the brilliant new waxing "A Prayer For Thee" - God, it sounds like Roy Orbison!
			<p>
			As usual, Big Tim had to be restrained with steel hawsers before taking the stage before everyone
			was in the house. Eventually we let him go up there. As the dulcet tones of "I'm Batman" by The
			Marble Tea gently faded out, Big Tim picked up the chords, strummed along and piled straight into
			the intro to one of his own tunes, an inspired beginning. Standing four-square in front of the
			swelling crowd, Tim was on fire, barely stopping for breath between one hit and another. A great
			set.
			<p>
			Minimal fuss as Mrs. Pilgrimm installed herself onstage and tore off into her set. Once again,
			absolutely inspired. It's not easy to write about Mrs. P's music, because it is so unique. There's
			just a torrent of mad, mutated and very beautiful cello music, all running at different speeds -
			indeed, things often go BACKWARDS - with catchy, teasing vocals delivered in a disarmingly direct
			and intimate fashion. If you want to know more, go to www.mrspilgrimm.de and order her fabulous
			"Alone Queen" album. Thank you.
			<p>
			Despite a few pre-gig concerns, ${joe_woolley} and his band turned in a wonderful set. Robert was
			magnificent on the drums, Luke warm and solid on electric bass, leaving acres of space for Joe's
			amped-up, heavily verbed acoustic guitar to spin out soulful psychedelic phrases across the top.
			Add in the Moonettes with their chorus of back-up vocals and you get a fabulous little late
			sixties West Coast beat happening, yea even unto the point of an Eight Miles High style feedback
			wig-out at the end. An encore was demanded and delivered. On went the "Nouvelle Vague" version of
			Guns of Brixton and there you have it for another month.
			<p>
			Thanks to all the artists and all the people who came to see them, thanks to the Labour Club and
			thanks to the guys at Weekender for their continuing and much-valued support in all this. Next
			month is our first anniversary and we shall be celebrating with the Jesse Morningstar Soul Revue,
			featuring Jesse, his band and a full supporting bill from the cream of Bristol's acoustic music
			scene - not to be missed.

			The Cellar is in a street called Cornmarket, right in the centre of Oxford. We understand that the rather
			splendid Oxford band The New Moon will be supporting on the night.
		)},
		pat=${literalizeCommas(
			At twenty past five in the wintry darkness of a Thursday night, the six members of
			Wilson, joined by Anita and Pete "Rommel" Heyworth, High Priest of the Temple Of
			Beer called The Racehorse, squeeze themselves into a small VW Transporter and set
			forth. An uneventful journey takes us to a small, orange basement beneath the very
			heart of Oxford. The Cellar used to be part of the wine cellars pof the Oxford Union
			Society (ooh), on whose lawns Russ, Anita and I later smoke a sneaky spliff. Now it
			is a groovy wee catacomb with a helpful soundman called Robin. We set up and
			soundcheck with ruthless efficiency then head off to the house of Matt Sewell,
			singer of The New Moon, where we are to be fed.
			<p>
			After an interesting van/underground-parking-lot interface we relax in style as Matt
			and Chrissie regale us with phenomenal quantities of delicious chilli and beer in
			their calm and lovely flat. Well, as calm as anything with Terry Walpole in it can
			be...
			<p>
			On the way back to the venue I try to send the entire band the wrong way up St.
			Giles Street. "It's probably changed a bit since you were here," says Pete.
			<p>
			The New Moon open the show at the faintly ridiculous hour of 8:30. There is already
			a small crowd, though, which swells throughout their set. Shades of Robin Hitchcock
			and Jeff Buckley hover around the surprisingly tough sounds that Matt and bassist
			Ian conjur. The double bass really does give the songs body and drive and Matt is in
			fine voice. Later they are joined by a man playing a flute. He's very good, but I
			wouldn't have said they really needed him.
			<p>
			A good crowd has gathered by the time that The Race begin their set. We don't know
			much about them beyond the fact that they come from Reading, but we do know that
			they are on a bit of a tour, and we rather suspect that perhaps most of the punters
			tonight will really be here to see them, not us. (This actually turns out not to be
			true - I should point out that a lot of them are probably there more for the
			pound-a-pint deal than for any particular one of the groups.)
			<p>
			The Race start strongly; in tune, powerful, passionate. It's The Big Music. During
			their first number, which starts off epic and then, rather bravely, just gets bigger
			and bigger, Russ and I both suddenly realise that they remind us of U2. It's a kind
			of music that I don't usually like, but they do it with charm and verve, and in a
			small cellar on a cold night it is very agreeable.The diminiutive frontman, who has
			a lovely voice, is whacking the shit out himself with his tambourine. I would be
			surprised if he sits down for a week. Two or three more epics into their set and
			Terry Walpole is on the dance floor, whirling like a dervish and frightening the
			natives. Meanwhile MC Bot is in something called The Goat With Three Heads. Russ and
			Anita and I attempt to go and find this goat, but get no further than the
			aforementioned lawns of academe.
			<p>
			Soon enough we are on the little stage: the sound is crisp, the house full, the
			headcase down the front. We play the same set we have played since Steve Bez joined
			us, and once again it is improved. It really feels good, with Steve Bez and Russ
			locked into a groove and Kathy good and loud, courtesy of The Race's marvellous bass
			tractor. Good response from the audience too. They didn't lose interest after The
			Race after all. Native observers later tell us that for Oxford they were positively
			animated.
			<p>
			A drink or two and a brief chat with Richard from Gappy Tooth Promotions (he sounded
			like my kind of guy) and we're stuffing ourselves back into the van, all paid up and
			packed away. On the trip home we hear somebody on national BBC Radio use the phrase
			"celebrating Auschwitz". Well done, everybody out there in Hollyoaks World. I was
			wondering how long it would take.
			<p>
			Sincere thanks, though, are due to Matt and Chrissie for their extreme hospitality;
			to Jimmy Evil for booking us; to The Race for being so easy to work with and for
			that lovely bass thing; and to Terry Walpole, for it is true that without him the
			evening would never actually have happened.

			Friends of Budvar~
			<p>
			This Friday, the 4th February, Masters of Budvar are once again in full effect at
			the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1. This month we hail the return of
			Jesse Morningstar, who is bringing with him a veritable soul revue of talent from
			his Bristol club night, The Greatness and the Magnificence.
			Under the title of The Four Shores (or is that the For Sures? - nobody really is),
			Jesse and three other artists will perform both individually and collectively. But
			don't just take our word for it: here's a message received at MOB Secret
			Headquarters from the artists themselves...
			<p>
			Hello, this tells of a tour undertaken by this band called The
			Four Shores. It consists of Banjo Kate Stables, Darren Countryboy
			Swindells, Jesse Morningstar Vernon and Jimmy the Canadian Goodrich.
			Each artist will be showcasing their own finest songs supported by the others
			<p>
			30th Jan - the Retreat, Long Ashton<br>
			3rd Feb London Royal College of Art<br>
			4th Feb Northampton Labour Club<br>
			6th Feb The Cabbage Patch, Twickenham<br>
			7th Feb - Rezonance FM session<br>
			9th Feb Seaton Village hall (nr Looe), Cornwall<br>
			11th Feb Callahans, Cardiff<br>
			13th Feb Hull, New Adelphi<br>
			18th Feb Bristol Bar Unlimited
			<p>
			The band have also made a 7" split single, one song by each member, on
			the Disco-ordination label.It's out on the 5th Feb so get your orders in now.
			<p>
			So there you have it. Bristol mini-massive soon appear. Alongside the usual MOB
			things, of course, like good beer at sensible prices, records both hot and mental
			from around the globe, free admission to everybody and the best vibe around. Hope to
			see you there.

			Jesse was great the other night. Our first banjo at the club! This bloke from Slovakia spots it and cries
			"BALALAIKA!" No, Kathie and I respond, it's a banjo, mate. In response to which he cries, slightly louder
			"BALALAIKA!!!" No, mate. It's an American balalaika. He laughs like a drain - "American balalaika - ha ha ha
			ha ha!" The banjo player is sporting the best pair of shoes ever worn at Masters of Budvar. Grown men find
			themselves confused at their emotional responses. Sonic Boom gets to frighten everybody and we all go home

			Our next Masters of Budvar night is on Friday 4th March at the Labour Club in
			Northampton NN1.
			The bill features:
			<p>
			Ramon de Juan - The welcome return of this wonderful Anglo-Spanish troubadour, promoting
			his debut album, Foot Of Film.
			Columbus & Crusoe - Excitingly different young Northampton combo...with glockenspiel...
			Pat Fish - The Skuff Karaoke man playing originals and covers.

			<p>
			Admission is free. Don't miss it.
			<p>
			Ramon de Juan<br>
			Columbus & Crusoe<br>
			Pat Fish<br>
			plus Superstar DJ Bic Hayes
			<p>
			Born in the Spanish, Sahara, raised amid the infamous nightclubs of downtown Benidorm and currently domiciled in Leeds
			under the production guidance of Choque Hosein, the captivating Ramon de Juan makes a welcome return to our club. With
			his first album Foot Of Film now released and garnering warm reviews, Ramon is on his way to big things. For those who
			missed his performance at Masters of Budvar last summer, Ramon plays an unbelievalbly simple, direct, honest set with
			acoustic guitar and voice. With these most basic of tools and a catalogue of richly melodic original tunes he charms you
			into his own parallel universe.
			Irrational feelings of calm, beauty and warmth are the inevitable result. Could this be the start of the thaw?
			<p>
			Columbus & Crusoe are a highly-rated new ensemble from Wellingborough. Young, fresh and original, they seem to be
			entirely unaware of the excitement that they are causing wherever they play. Another act that is high on melody...and
			with a glockenspiel too! Tonight they will be performing as a duo.
			<p>
			Spoiling the party with his ineptly recorded backing tapes and questionable guitar technique, we also present
			Northampton's
			self-styled "loudest solo artist" Pat Fish. Get there early and marvel at his quaint misappropriation of mid-period
			Temptations guitar licks while you get the beers in.
			<p>
			On the record decks we have guest Superstar DJ Bic Hayes. Bic is the boss of Ramon's record label. He is also a world
			class guitarist whose CV includes The Cardiacs, Levitation and Dark Star. He currently plays alongside Mark Refoy in the
			Pet Shop Boys touring line-up.
			<p>
			As usual, all this comes for free in the unpretentious and genial surroundings of the Labour Club, Charles Street, NN1.
			<p>
			Excerpts from a review of Ramon de Juan's first EP written by Sam Saunders, Leeds Music Scene:
			<blockquote>
			It is an exquisite piece of work. It's so much more than just mood music. Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your
			thing. But you have to stand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst
			yourself with joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one. There are some distant FX guitar touches and the
			lightest of electronic suggestions. It fades deliciously away, leaving a nostalgic and lonesome feeling as piano notes
			fall like gentle touches of silk. It is beautiful.
			<p>
			It isn't rock and roll, but it could save your love life.
			Four and a half stars
			</blockquote>
			Praise for Ramon's new album, Foot of Film:
			<blockquote>
			Foot of Film does not clamour for attention; instead, it draws you in almost imperceptibly with its diet of delicate
			strummery, patches of melancholy and whimsy and De Juan's pure, beseeching tones.
			Fiona Shepherd - The Scotsman'

			Ramon de Juan made a triumphant return to Masters of Budvar last Friday, silencing the rather garrulous
			crowd with the simple power of a good tune properly sung. Encores way beyond closing-time and pleasing
			sales of his new album were the eventual outcome.
			<p>
			Columbus & Crusoe gave a good indication of why they
			are attracting so much interest around these parts; even playing in a stripped-down format, they
			charmed and intrigued with their sweet, unassuming and yet instantly memorable tunes. They also brought
			with them a significant number of young fans, so here's hoping that they enjoyed the night and will
			consider coming again.
			<p>
			I opened up the proceedings, playing a couple of acoustic numbers with Joe
			Woolley before turning on the tape recorder and going all sparkly on the assembled. I have to say that
			I enjoyed it, especially the last couple of numbers, which, frankly, had no place in a folk club...

			California's musical auteur Anton Barbeau."
			-Pop Matters
			<p>
			"It's a rare thing these days to stumble upon musical genius. While many musicians are happy to travel
			a currently established road, Anton Barbeau veers off into a direction not heard since the heyday of
			60's pop."

			Still, we had been to the previous Tom Hall Memorial show back in 2003 and that had been a beauty, so we had
			some reason to hope that this third attempt on the Ken Turner Ice Face might work out. The soundman had all
			our technical whoopsie-daisy in advance, we were (as advertised) drummed to the hilt. Assuming that anybody
			turned up, this one ought to be good.
			<p>
			Soundchecking in the afternoon ate right into Doctor Who, so we only just managed to make it back to Stevie
			G's house in time to see the big blubbery aliens get their faces blown off by a nuclear missile. Bravo! Stevie
			G serves out the curry!
			<p>
			Moments later, Steve is back out the door, heading back to the festival to play the opening set with Ghost
			Train. We mill about the house playing the Good Cop Bad Cop album and knocking back the strong continental
			lagers. It's not long before Steve returns, mortified. Apparently Ghost Train have spent their set imprisoned
			among a forest of microphone stands, not that these have in any way rendered the band audible. Yes, there are
			people there. No, he doesn't want to go back there again, if that's all right with us.
			<p>
			Of course, we do all go back down there, quite sharpish, in fact. I think that Steve has awakened our
			curiosity. We arrive to catch the end of Curtis' set, then we settle in and lay about the generous backstage
			spread while watching Pete Garofalo and Sue Figuoera front a band doing Tom Hall songs, rather well as it
			goes. But my, it is quiet. I take to telling anybody who will listen that my guitar amplifier is louder than
			all that lot up there put together. I do this because I am becoming nervous. I am becoming nervous because I
			cannot imagine what will happen when we get up there with our horrible loud music.
			<p>
			Sara Spade comes on and delivers a lovely set, during which I discover that Steve Beswick and Ian Anderson
			have taken strategic control of the best public toilet in the county. Soap! Paper towels! No wonder they are
			guarding the doorway so carefully.
			<p>
			And then we are on. And nobody throws anything. Nothing breaks. Nobody does anything stupid. We just play and
			shout and it all works perfectly. Everybody has a good time. Curtis keeps running up to deliver odd little
			vocal whoopsie-daisies. People thrashing about down the front, all that stuff. A good time is had by all (of
			us, anyway) and I don't see a single person with their hands over their ears. We even get to play our planned
			- inevitable - encore of "Hippy Shit".
			<p>
			Wilson finally get a positive result at the Cricket Club and the Phippsville Festival is a big success all
			round. We thank the crew, loot the vino and head back to Steve's. Somebody hands me a margarita.

			<p>
			Astonishing harmonica virtuoso from Canada. Formerly a member of the Crash Test Dummies, and featured in the current

			<p>
			Sometimes you find the strangest things in the strangest places. Black Carrot come from the sleepy provincial town of
			Market Harborough, where they have clearly evolved in splendid isolation. A trio with dums, bass and saxophones, they play
			a fierce, largely improvised set of what they themselves style krautrock-inspired space jazz folk. Certainly, if you have

			about Black Carrot.

			Joe needs no introduction to Masters of Budvar regulars. This preposterously talented young sixties throwback is at the

			Wolfgang Tschegg
			<p>
			Born in a part of Austria where the German language never really made it into the 15th Century, Wolfgang Tschegg studied at the conservatory in Vienna and made
			early appearances at that city's notorious Flex Club, U-4 and Szene Wien before recording his extraordinarily beautiful first album in a rural church. He recorded
			two further albums with Vienna Scientists producer Gernot Ebenlechner before decamping for several months to New York. He is currently based in Berlin and has
			just released another CD.
			<p>
			Styling himself the Electric Alpine Country Boy, Wolfgang mixes soulful Vienna house backing tracks with melodic electric guitar lines and that wonderful rich,
			dark voice of his.  Often he sings in German, sometimes in English, occasionally in Italian or French, but the beauty and feeling of his songs need no
			translating.
			<p>
			Wolfgang is in the UK for just two dates, at London's 12 Bar Club on Sunday 5th June (for all you metropolitan readers) and, of course, at Masters of Budvar this
			Friday. Check out this unique artist for yourselves, people.
			<p>
			Disappointment is not an option.
			<p>
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.wolfgangtschegg.de)}
			<p>
			Peter Crouch
			<p>
			From 1991 to 1993 Peter Crouch was the lead guitarist in the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy. Since then he has been writing and producing songs from his home studio
			under the name Cellartime, building a substantial body of work that bears comparison with Leonard Cohen, Dean Wareham or English post-punk songwriters like the
			Weather Prophets' Peter Astor and Laurence Heyward of Felt. He admits to influences from Randy Newman and Robert Cray, so expect a dark blues inflection to his
			sweet, elegantly simple tunes of misery and despair.
			<p>
			Important note to fans of Southampton FC: this is not the same Peter Crouch as the lanky Spurs reject you will be shortly losing to a Premiership club.
			<p>
			Pat Fish
			<p>
			As Creation Records positivity-generator-in-chief Edward Ball once put it, "Part Madonna, part Maradona". This man likes to make what he calls Skuff Karaoke.
			Funny, really - it was Wolfgang Tschegg who sold him on the idea in the first place. A part electric, part acoustic set with lush melodies and annoying little
			squelchy noises of uncertain origin.

			Outrage at Masters of Budvar! Fishy walks on and sings "Julian Cope is Dead"! He can't resist the urge to sing it
			like Bill Drummond. Curtis barely resists the urge to throw furniture about. ${joe_woolley} then proceeds to join in to
			play lead on Sister Death. JBC twin lead guitar beasts Peter Crouch and ${max} (for it is he) gaze in baffled
			astonishment. Fishy blames Big Tim Sansom (a spurious excuse, if ever there were one) and careers off into a karaoke
			set, crashing into the wall about twenty minutes later with a rendition of De La Soul's "Tread Water".
			<p>
			This is Peter Crouch's first ever solo show, so he has sent for moral support and recruited the aforementioned Eider
			to play his lovely old Gretsch while a seated Crouchy sings and plays acoustic rhythm. Max starts a little quiet,
			but, once he hits the right level, he provides a beautiful lush accompaniment to Crouchy's acid-tongued chronicles of
			intercontinental anguish and despair. It's fun to hear him playing Crouchy's own lead lines from the recordings too.
			Altogether it's an inspired pairing: elegant,
			world-weary, darkly tuneful and quite mesmerising. We want this back again.
			<p>
			Wearing a baseball cap and a fat old semi-acoustic that could almost give Max's Gretsch a run for its money,
			accompanied by assorted odd little bits of machinery and the dapper German jazz bassist Rainer, Wolfgang Tschegg
			returns to Northampton Town. He opens up with one of my favourite tunes, "Helicopter", then makes brief introductions
			before setting up the mutated bossanova beat for "Mann aus den Bergen", one of the loveliest tunes on his new album.
			Next comes a choppy little number called Mustang: "And if you ask yourself do I mean the car or the horse...it
			doesn't matter. Both are cool." By this stage of the game Wolfgang and Rainer are really grooving, and although their
			singing in German makes them a touch impenetrable, the audience are starting to get it too. Me, I'm sitting right in
			front of the stage, so happy I could...well, never mind what I could do. Wolfgang is giving that guitar a good going
			over. "Yeah, yeah - all right!" Then into the cool ballad "Das Haus" and "Dunkel" ("It's a little bit dark, but not
			very dark") complete with harmonica solo before the recorder apocalypse that heralds the new single "Tarzan Sagt"
			(Yes, "Tarzan Says", that's right...) There is a touching version of "Winter Kompakt" before Rainer takes gamely to
			the electric piano for "Superhimmel". There is a supremely far-out droney thing called "Das Schiff" ("It's a space
			ship") with some outrageous bendy bass playing, all of which has people cheering like fools and baying for more, so
			we are graced with a kicking, souped-up "Sonnenmaedchen" to conclude. It was all unspeakably beautiful. So I shall
			speak of it no more, save to offer my heartfelt thanks to Wolfgang and Rainer for coming and doing that in our club.
			<p>
			Back at Shakespeare Villas we enjoyed another fine afterhours set from ${joe_woolley}, whose CD was promptly seized by
			Rainer for further investigation back in Berlin. Doesn't it get light early these days? What's that you say, Crouchy?
			No, leave it. Leave it.

			Twinfest was a riot all round. Bot got shouted at for doing his Roger Daltrey impression, but the SM58 is a resilient model and no harm ended up being done. In

			Some far-out and provocative shit on offer at Friday's latest in the Masters of Budvar What's On Next Challenge
			Series.
			On the stereo we played New Order, Can, Anthony and the Johnsons, Rolo McGinty's Bad Apples CD and more besides, but
			that's not really what I meant. After a month or two away, the funny coloured lights made a welcome return to action,
			and we had that black stuff hanging up all over the walls and the windows, with big old electric fans blowing every
			whichway. That's not it either, though.
			<p>
			At about 9:15 three young men take to the corner of the room which, with an arch and knowing wink, we call "the
			stage". These men, for a whom a small and painfully hip crowd has gathered, are none other than Elk Force. Now, I
			believe that in my advertising spiel I might possibly have caused some inadvertent distress to Elk Force's hip-hop
			kingpin Scott by implying that The Force might in some way prove difficult or...I think the word was "harrowing". As
			he himself put it:
			<p class="annotation">
			" We honestly didn't know we were traumatic, terrifying and troublesome. We always thought we were more of a mildly
			left wing pop outfit for the mtv generation. (that was the idea anyway). Just for the record, we in no way support
			chairman mao - He was a very bad man whose presence still seems to loom large and overshadow China - It's time China
			faced up to this and moved on."
			</p>
			But of course.
			<p>
			To be fair, the Hinterhoff label's latest hopefuls had, since recording their inital manifesto, focussed their -
			shall we say? - sonic maelstrom with the clever addition of drummer Ben Jackson, last seen round these parts with
			Saab 77. With Ben driving things along with force and precision, it was easier to follow the intricate and
			ever-so-slightly mental patterns that Scott and Richard weave with their guitars. Great lyrics well delivered. It's a
			shame that tune about the Jesus Centre doesn't go on a bit longer. Remix, anybody?
			<p>
			This was the first appearance of Elk Force and they played really well. By the end of the night it was hard to find a
			punter not proudly sporting their Elk Force button badge. I have no idea as to whether these people are going to do
			more of this, and I've no idea how to describe what they do. I still think they're mental, but I can see how they
			might not appear that way to people who listen to modern post-rock type stuff. Somewhere to the left of Pavement,
			perhaps. (I know nothing about that kind of music. Shows, doesn't it?)
			<p>
			Swiftly following The Force came Rosie Wilby accompanied by Kontra Band's Al Tate on bass and Paul de Gallier on
			percussion. A much more melodic proposition, the trio made the most of the club sound system with a warm, deep sound
			that made a perfect setting for Rosie's singing. Still reeling from Glastonbury, Rosie even took on the swelling
			crowd of hepsters on her own, singing the most delicate ballad imaginable. There is an awful lot of songwriting savvy
			at work here, choruses that just fall right out at you, like that one on You Amaze Me, which gets stuck in my damn
			head all the time. And check out Guitar Rosie - she knows all the chords. A warm, assured showing; just the thing for
			just that moment, really.
			<p>
			When the Telescopes arrived for a soundcheck I was surprised to see that they showed no interest in any of the
			microphones set up around the stage and that they didn't really seem to have anything that they wanted to plug into
			the PA. All these charming types from Burton On Trent really seemed to want was tables. As many tables as you've got,
			really, thanks. Brilliant. On these tables Steven and Lorin set up guitars and various devices which they employ to
			coax sounds from these guitars. They effectively operate on the instruments, like surgeons. Instead of scalpels they
			employ ball-bearings, violin bows, portable electric fans, crocodile clips and a seven inch tall metal robot. All of
			which goes off into a bewildering array of outboard hardware for treatment before barreling on out the amplifiers at
			you, the punter. Jo, meanwhile, sits on her amp, big old 335 in her lap, rapt in concentration.
			<p>
			By the time the Telescopes were taking to the stage it had crossed my mid that I might as well try to use the three
			microphones to some effect, so in a homage to the Telescopes' erstwhile producer Rich Formby, I pottered around "sort
			of" setting up the mics to pick up amps and ambience and broadcast same through the PA. To be honest, I wish I'd done
			it all a bit louder.
			<p>
			The Telescopes start their set with a lush drone, centred around the soporific beat of a needle spinning on an empty
			record deck. The drone builds, changes texture, swells, recedes. The surgeons are hard at work on their instruments,
			heads down. Jo's head is down too. When once she glances up into the crowd it is with a look of icy determination
			that could stop a speeding truck. People are staring open-mouthed. No beat comes crashing in, no vocal emerges; only
			the most abstract wisps of melody, conjured from the very effect of the different constituent elements of the drone
			moving cyclically/seismically together and apart. Some people, it has to be said, are becoming impatient. Most are
			very quiet. I'm bloody riveted, me.
			<p>
			After who-knows-how-long the initial drone starts to fade and an electronic ghost of a beat begins to pulse beneath
			the soundscapes. They're into Phase Two of their set and things are getting a touch polarised. There are people
			actually leaving. Well, it's Friday night and maybe this isn't what they'd bargained for and that's fair enough.
			Meanwhile back on Planet X, the Telescopes continue to sculpt and shape their noise to great effect. When finally,
			after about 45 minutes of utterly beautiful music, they achieve a graceful landing, those who have taken the ride
			along with them give genuinely warm and appreciative applause. With good reason. This is not the sort of thing that
			you see every day. In fact, the last time I can recall being at a gig like this was the Spacemen's evening of
			contemporary sitar music at the Watermans Art Centre in Brentford. Frankly and fortunately, the atmosphere tonight
			doesn't come close to the chilly miasma of misunderstanding, suspicion and thinly-veiled hostility that characterised
			the event that launched the Dreamweapon. No, China has moved on, so instead it's trebles all round and back to
			Masters of Budvar Secret Headquarters for afters. Thanks to the Labour Club, Andy, all the musicians and everybody
			who came out.

			BARRY "THE FISH" MELTON
			<p>
			JOE WOOLLEY
			<p>
			A genuine living legend of the San Francisco psychedelic underground is coming to play in Northampton Town. Barry
			Melton was the lead guitarist in Country Joe And The Fish. Hell, people, he IS "The Fish". He played at Monterey
			Pop. He played at Woodstock. He has played with everybody from Quicksilver's John Cipollina to the Grateful Dead.
			And now, by a quirk of fate which even we don't quite understand, he's coming to play - solo and acoustic - in the
			top room of the Labour Club! Barry has promised two 45 minute sets, taking in everything from folk to blues to the
			truly freaked-out. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the music lovers of Northampton to see The Real Deal
			up close and personal. You can check out Barry Melton's web pages at: www.counterculture.net/thefish
			<p>
			Support will come from Long Buckby's rising folk/blues troubadour ${joe_woolley}.
			<p>
			The event will take place across the entire top floor of the Labour Club, with an upstairs bar/chill-out room. If
			you good people show enough interest, the club will lay on hot veggie food (not included in the ticket price,
			though.)
			<p>
			There are only 40 tickets available for this unique, intimate show. Tickets will cost &pound;10:00 and will be available
			from the Labour Club from Saturday 9th July (tomorrow, when, incidentally, Slipstream are playing the main bar for
			free). Alternatively, as a preferred trading nation, you can reserve your tickets by replying to this e-mail. When
			ordering tickets, please let us know if you would be interested in the food option so that the Labour Club can gauge
			demand for this.All tickets will be numbered and must be paid for in cash before the date of the show.
			<p>
			Don't delay - order your tickets today!

			<div class="annotation">
			"According to the fabled Rough guide to Rock, Country Joe & The Fish "formed in Berkley, California, 1965" and made
			"substantial contributions to the halcyon days of psychedelic music". The very same Barry "The Fish" Melton graced
			Northampton with this intimate gig, taking to the hot seat only after ${joe_woolley} set the scene with his always
			delightfully affecting yet unaffected acoustic ditties.
			<p>
			While the rickety old Labour Club holds no more history for some than a few Friday night drinking excursions, Barry Melton
			is enamoured with its links to a labour movement arguably long forgotten. When they weren't fighting for workers' rights
			his parents introduced him to the wistful, witty and inspiring folk songs of the early 1930s American labour movement,
			mirrored in the union posters on the walls of Northampton's own Labour Club.
			<p>
			Turns out that like a fine wine you've never heard of but you know you're going to enjoy, Barry Melton is rich and
			satisfying in the drinking. Far from stuck in a 1960s time warp, he recalls Woodstock psychedelia with the wry humour of a
			man who knows that getting wasted and writing songs about hamburgers falling in love with hotdogs is a novelty that just
			won't last.
			<p>
			Still, he doesn't regret one moment of it, and neither do we as his awesome, and at times ridiculous, gravelly blues and
			traditional union chants float into the night air, reminding Northampton that there's a vintage you can't buy on Camden

			Masters of Budvar present
			<p>
			-at-
			<p>
			The Labour Club, Northampton NN1
			<p>
			Friday 5th August 2005
			<p>
			COLUMBUS & CRUSOE
			<p>
			Rising young band from Wellingborough with a uniquely chilled English sensibility and lots of mad little instruments.
			A welcome return to Masters of Budvar for this intriguing young band from Wellingborough.
			<p>
			Chilled, English and elegant is their thing. Their songs have a wide-eyed innocence that sits well with their lovely
			melodies and fullsome arrangements. Last time they appeared as a duo - this time it will be the full band. Already
			Weekender chart-toppers, Columbus & Crusoe are busting out this summer. Come and enjoy them.
			<p>
			ANTON BARBEAU
			<p>
			Standing in heroically at the last minute to cover for a sadly unavailable Big Tim, the Sacramento mentallist returns to
			Master of Budvar with more of his crazed, irony-drenched stadium folk. Must be seen to be believed, people.
			<p>
			SPITTLE RATTLE
			<p>
			Michael Holloway's cracked and twisted Nene Delta blues.
			Nice sound, pretty lights, cheap drinks, great atmosphere. The enlightened Masters of Budvar strike another blow for
			proper entertainment.
			Under this none-more-black handle Michael Holloway practices his own unique style of cracked, demented urban blues. This
			solo set promises to be compelling stuff.
			<p>
			It's all free, of course, lovely sound, lovely retro lighting, lovely Czech beer, lovely people.
			<p>
			Assume that the first artist will be on stage at 9:00 o'clock and you can't go wrong. Hope to see you there.

		pat=${literalizeCommas(
			It is three thirty on a damp afternoon in the teeth-grindingly picturesque village of Castle Ashby. A
			large silver station wagon packed to the gunnels with boxes of black and chrome slides stealthily along
			a quaint country lane. Two faintly desperate looking men in sunglasses are in the front, their windows
			wound fully down, as though the day were much sunnier than it is. From those windows comes a cloud of
			acrid smoke and the unmistakeable roar of Killing Joke's mighty Asteroid. The first wave has almost
			made it to Security Checkpoint One.
			<p>
			On the floor of the Nene Valley some twelve miles east of Northampton lie the Grendon Lakes. The place
			is a local beauty spot, popular with fishermen, families and - on occasion - with the more hardcore
			element of the Racehorse regulars. There is a nice little club house there with a bar, restaurant and
			all the facilities you could want. A pleasant little patio looks out over the water.
			<p>
			Because of the eponymous lakes, somebody has had the bright idea of staging an extreme sports event
			here: wakeboarding, skateboarding, BMX, all that sort of thing. Air 05 is to be a three day event with
			live music, DJs, camping, all that good shit. Wilson have been invited to play the first evening, so
			here we are, about half a mile off the main road, waiting in a short line of vehicles queuing to clear
			security. Agent Wilson and I are impressed to see that the people checking the vehicles are in
			paramilitary garb, some with helmets and goggles. They do take their time, though. It must have
			something to do with the large and immobile Winnebago parked up about three ahead of us. Eventually we
			announce ourselves as Wilson: The First Wave and are tooled up with the requisite paperwork to proceed
			to Security Checkpoint Two. We continue down the track towards the lakes, wondering how many people are
			going to be queuing up at that gate later in the weekend.
			<p>
			Checkpoint Two succumbs easily to the glamour of our new paperwork and in a minute or two we are
			pulling up outside the clubhouse. As we load in Rob from The Buzz is at the controls. playing groovy
			punk, soul and dub sounds to perhaps two or three dozen people milling about on the patio or down by
			the lake, where the wakeboarders are warming up. Russ tools me up with some fags and leaves me to set
			up as much kit as I can while he sets off back to NN1 to fetch the Second Wave. Rob Carter buys me a
			pint of Stella. It is 4:00pm.
			<p>
			At a picnic table high on a hill above the lake under a leaden sky they sit, crow-like. Wilson, minus
			MC Bot but plus Anita Allbright and her small Soviet flask of brandy, huddle together, safe in the
			knowledge that a soundcheck has finally been completed. A few last shafts of sunlight break through the
			looming clouds. Red sky at night: shepherd's delight. Red sky in the morning: nuclear war.
			<p>
			We watch the wakeboarders still practising in the fading light. They are getting air all right. It is
			radical, possibly gnarly even. Stevie G decides that he wants to see some mishap action. Each time one
			of the talented aquatic daredevils comes speeding by, Steve cries with a passionate intensity: "Foot off!"
			<p>
			A tall, dark figure is coming up the hill towards the picnic table. It is unsteady on its feet and it
			is gesticulating wildly in a manner that we cannot fully understand. It is MC Bot and he feels like
			getting naked. Somebody asks what time it is. It is eight o'clock. We are on at ten o'clock. A sort of
			desperate hilarity breaks out.
			<p>
			I miss the first band on the bill. Rob Carter reckons that they did Stone Roses songs in a Norfolk
			accent: "The Alan Partridge Project". Mind you, Rob Carter is off his face. They seemed like perfectly
			decent people to me. I wobble off and sit by the peaceful water's edge. Rob Carter plays Crazy Horses
			by the Osmonds. While I am still reeling from this, he wanders out of the clubhouse and finds me at the
			water's edge: "Oi, Buckley - No!"
			<p>
			The second band are very competent and are going down very well with the ten or twelve people who have
			actually gone into the clubhouse. This is not entirely the band's fault. The room is small and the PA
			is very large indeed. Those who are in the room are literally pinned along the back wall. This does
			not, however, sink in at the time. Somehow I reckon it will be different for us. Had you asked me where
			I thought all the people were coming from, I might have gone a bit quiet, though.
			<p>
			From the moment we take the stage it is chaos. We are really, really loud. MC Bot is really, really off
			it and really, really up for it at the same time. The stage doesn't even hold him until the first
			chorus. He's out there. Those who weren''t already pinned against the back wall by the volume are now
			cowering there in the hope that the crazy singer man's microphone lead won't reach that far. It does,
			though. Nobody is safe. With Bot spending most of his time in front of the PA, the filthy racket that
			we are already generating becomes wholesomely larded with swathes of mid-range feedback. The band is
			playing its teeth out. It's murder.
			<p>
			There is so little room on the stage that I stay pretty much immobile, head down, getting on with it as
			best I can. I miss lots of what is going on. By the end I pretty much assume that we have cleared the
			place. So as everyone leaves the stage I get down on the floor and make with a little bit of delay
			feedback. As the other sounds die away I start to reduce the level, then slow it down to sound like a
			record slowly running out of speed. It takes ages. I am certain that nobody is paying the slightest
			attention. As finally I fade the feedback out to silence, for a second you can hear a pin drop. Then
			about three young girls burst into keen applause. Bless 'em, I think, they were waiting for the ending.
			A few people come up and say very polite things. Rob Carter reckons it was fantastic. Did I mention
			that Rob Carter is off his face?
			<p>
			By midnight we are speeding back through the Northamptonshire country lanes, heading for Agent
			Wilson's. Running the performance back in my head I simply cannot see how we are going to play the
			Balloon Festival tomorrow without getting fully and comprehensively arrested.

			In a move calculated to cause anxiety and stress across the nation, Wilson will be appearing at the Northampton Balloon Festival on Saturday 20th August.
			<p>
			Not exactly the sort of event at which you would expect to find us, perhaps, but it's all the work of Jon and Griff at the BBC Radio Northampton Weekender.
			<p>
			For that Saturday only they are taking control of the big stage at the Barrack Road end of the Racecourse (where Desmond Dekker played that fantastic set last year) and presenting a bunch of local bands who feature on their show. It's not one of their live outside broadcast affairs (too risky - Wilson are on, you know), but they are planning on recording the event and broadcasting the best bits on later editions of the Weekender.
			<p>
			As well as Wilson, the event features Joe Woolley and his band (featuring our own, dear Misery), Visionstate, One Toy Soldier and Northampton Town's latest Fierce Panda signings, Atlantic Dash. Jon and Griff will be playing records, and so will the mighty Black Cat Found and DJs from Inspiration FM. Sounds like it's going to be a great day out.
			<p>
			Wilson will be appearing on the Weekender Stage at about 5:00pm on Saturday 20th August. It's free to get in, so bring your friends and we'll all have a proper lark in the park.

		pat=${literalizeCommas(
			The First Wave penetrates the Balloon Festival at about 3:30 on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Happily
			Julie Reinger and the Weather Prophets have got it badly wrong. Deluge there is none. It's a beautiful
			day in the neighbourhood. The first thing we find as we enter the backstage compound is the Mystic
			Crew, which is a good way to start. Northampton's finest original reggae rockers have the slot before
			ours this afternoon, but right now the Drake Music Project are onstage. They are an extraordinary band,
			made up entirely of some pretty severely disabled people. With keyboards and percussion they are
			weaving a mad, precise and rather beautiful sort of mutated sixties soundtrack samba sound. It's like
			nothing you have ever heard. See them if you get the chance; you won't believe what's going on in front
			of you.
			<p>
			By the time the Second Wave has arrived, there is something even stranger up there on the stage. In my
			weakened condition I am astonished to see a seven foot high giant panda in a bright red satin Fun
			Manchu gown cavorting with an equally massive dog, a bear in dungarees and a huge koala in a yellow
			t-shirt with a map of Australia on it. They go into a frenzied dance routine to a song about somebody
			(one them, I can only guess) having a birthday. This also is like nothing you have ever seen. It is
			wrong, distressing and horribly seductive. Ah, the lure of plush - perhaps it is as well that Stevie G
			is not with us today. A nice holiday in the wholesome seaside air of beautiful Pembrokeshire will
			surely be better for the poor man's head. Meanwhile, I am trying to figure how I can get my hands on
			the panda outfit. Then I have to have some beer. Quickly.
			<p>
			The relentless positivity and family-friendliness of the acts onstage has completely vaporized my head.
			What are we doing here with our songs about cancer, corruption and war? When a nice man comes out and
			announces the Mystic Crew with a spiel that involves the words "positive sunshine vibrations" I teeter
			on the edge of panic.
			<p>
			Happily, the Crew are positive in all the right ways. Dennis on the bass sounds huge and he's playing a
			blinder. With both Robbie and Zebby onstage the Mystics are blessed with two really charismatic,
			tuneful front men, which really gets the crowd involved. Nothing too mental, mind, all solid, melodic
			stuff, beautifully delivered. Though I don't know if I'll ever get my head around the version of "I
			Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" ...however much of an improvement it is on the original.
			<p>
			The really good news is that all this reggae music is sounding fantastic through the big old outdoor
			PA. Somebody out there is clearly well on top of their job. This we find reassuring. We head backstage
			to assemble our kit, just in time to find our old friend Ruby the red bus pulling in with Jonny Mattock
			at the wheel and a well-dressed but not entirely stable Joe Woolley on board. Out of the van he comes.
			Over he goes. Later tonight I will find him being carried, unconscious, down the stairs on the back of
			Agent Wilson. Griff from the BBC Weekender comes by and asks how it went at Air 05 last night. "Chaos,
			mate. Like the Stooges' last ever gig," I tell him with a rueful smile. I can feel the bravery
			radiating off him. All his artist are belong out control.
			<p>
			Mystic Crew finish their set to warm applause, then there are a fairly frantic fifteen minutes of
			moving shit about, plugging shit in and generally sorting shit out. At 5:30 the DJ shuts down and
			that's it: we're on. The first sound that can be heard is a police radio, dubbed up to the eyes,
			floating out over bewildered balloon festival families. There are, to our delight, little knots of
			mates out there in the crowd. Also there is Holly. As the instruments kick in and we realise that, yes,
			we can more or less all hear each other on this whopping great stage, it's all set. If only the very
			first line of the song wasn't "Grandpa pissed his pants again"...
			<p>
			Bot and I are on our best behaviour. This grandpa did him pants instead. Still, it doesn't change the
			fact that we are starting with a tune about incest, madness, sickness and death. I'm missing Steve, me.
			I feel like I'm too loud and exposed on my stupid ostrich guitar. I'm wondering if we might be needing
			to dig deep to find a little something extra this afternoon when something comes to pass.
			<p>
			As the first chorus hits I look to my right and there is Curtis, craning to shout harmoniously down my
			microphone. No milk crates being available, the stage crew sort him out with his own microphone and -
			behold - we are six once again. The return of Mister E. Wilson! Curt stalks the stage, vibing things up
			a treat. There are enough Wilson heads in the audience to get something going and the whole set starts
			to roll rather nicely. Ash and Rhiannon from the Racehorse are down the front, arms in the air, rocking
			it properly. Holly wants to hear that song about bananas, but we play Police Chief instead. It's not
			the vicious maelstrom of last night, which is probably all to the good. It's measured and right and
			what we lose from Stevie G's wicked guitar we make up with the spectacle of a shouty bald man stamping
			about shouting "Kill 'im!" That and the fact that Steve Bes is on fire. Literally. Smoke rising all
			around him in the most disconcerting fashion.
			<p>
			As we come off stage there is nobody waiting with plastic handcuffs. We count this as a victory. We
			clear the stage in preparation for Joe and Jonny. The DJ from Inspiration FM teases the audience,
			telling them that they are about to see Jah Woolley.
			<p>
			People speak kindly to us and tell us that the sound was good. Having seen the Mystics I can get my
			head around this and I feel pleased. Then the Mystics tell us that we were good, and we tell them that
			they were good, and respect is all over the place. I realise that we have indeed got away with it. Then
			I have to have another beer. Quickly.
			<p>
			Joe and Jonny turn in a set that is completely mental. Jon's kick drum is massive, more than
			compensating for the lack of any bass guitar. Joe is ranting and raving like a good 'un, shredding at
			his acoustic guitar, but the entire crowd has its back to him, watching as about 50 balloons take off
			into the lovely blue sky for their evening flight. This is something that I do not envy him. Unable to
			gaze any longer upon the bizarre spectacle, I join MC Bot backstage for debriefing.
			"So, did you know that Curtis was coming?" he asks.
			<p>
			"Well, he stopped by my yard about two hours ago in a big red Piper Heidsieck apron and I slipped him
			Stevie G's backstage pass...but I didn't know he was going to do that."
			"Aaaaaaah..."
			<p>
			We hang out behind the stage and listen to Joe and Jon ripping it up like they are The Who or
			something. They do a version of "Who Do You Love?" which goes mad at the end. Jon is doing ridiculous,
			over-the-top, out-of-time Keith Moon drum rolls. The guitar sounds very peculiar indeed. Then all we
			can hear is Jon whacking the occasional cymbal, apparently at random. Then we see Jon and Joe come
			reeling down the ramp from the stage, arm in arm, covered in sweat, gathering momentum and ready to go
			over in about...ooooh...two and three quarter seconds. Yup. There they go. Whump! Upright again, Jon
			dives into Ruby and emerges with a bottle of champagne. He and Joe make like racing drivers. At one
			point they have both got champagne coming out of their noses. By this time, of course, Wilson have hold
			of the bottle.
			<p>
			Of course, it turns out that we've missed it all. Kathie, who was out front, tells me all about it, how
			Joe smashed his guitar to matchwood in front of the whole crowd. Those weird single cymbal crashes?
			That was Jon synchronising with the final, lethal blows. Kathie is concerned "What's he going to do
			now?" she wants to know, not unreasonably. Turns out that Joe had bought a guitar especially for the
			purpose. "What did you pay for that then?" I ask him. "Ten quid" he replies, the devious hound. Of
			course, round about now I have to have another beer. Quickly.
			<p>
			We stick around a while to enjoy Visionstate, who do good things with the old bass-drums-two guitar
			line-up. Sharp and a bit modal, reminiscent of very early Oasis, but in a good way. They could make a
			lot of young people very sweaty. I'd enjoyed their record on the Weekender show, and I wasn't
			disappointed. Perhaps they'd like to play the Labour Club some time? But it's time to go now, for we
			have to eat and make our way down the hill to Mister Cotton's house for the mother of all parties.
			<p>
			Just to confirm: Nobody got arrested. Nobody got hurt. Nothing got broken. Except Joe's guitar. And he
			meant to do that. Honest.

			The way that Joe Woolley sold this night to me was that there was nothing booked in at the Labour Club, so he
			was planning to take his estimable acoustic club downstairs into the main bar, a sort of "Beat Saturday" if
			you will. You know the sort of thing - not a "proper" gig, just a few mates sat round playing tunes in the
			neighbourhood bar of a Saturday night. Old school. Easy. Local.
			<p>
			So would I care to put in half an hour as a solo acoustic pensioner? Sure, beats watching facile Saturday
			night TV.
			I can tape Match of the Day. No problem.
			<p>
			Then a few days before the gig, Joe comes to me and asks about my bass playing. After his recent excesses
			with Jon Mattock, Joe is after rocking himself up. We spend a boozy evening learning a Warren Zevon tune.
			Towards the end of the evening Joe tells me that he wants to play the Perfect Disaster's B-52! It crosses my
			mind that Jonny used to play B-52 with the Perfect Disaster. Bloody hell, you might say.
			<p>
			Disconcerted, enraged with a vital surge of pure rock fury, but without any time to go on a programming
			spree, I decide that my approach to my set should be of the old school. I style it "sit down mental". No amp,
			no fancy playing or singing, just heads-down, wig-out acoustic idiot music...and if anybody doesn't like it,
			they can meet my piggie Sam. My only intention is to keep the guitar in tune. After that, it's all up for
			grabs.
			<p>
			So this is what I play:
			<p>
			Quality People - The Ugliest Song In The World - Big Jake (by Curtis) - Ghosts - Hysteria - Sister Death.
			<p>
			For the last song I am joined by Joe, who burns vital gases out of the atmosphere with his electric guitar.
			It's about 9:45 and the Labour Club is wringing with hideous scrabbling guitar noise. Yes. Welcome to
			acoustic night.
			<p>
			Joe takes the stage and plays a few numbers on his own. Then Jon Mattock joins him for a few tunes. The small
			crowd is growing larger and rowdier. Joe is giving his all. Jonny is watching him like a hawk and drumming
			like a medium. Then they call me back up and I have to strap on the big bass. We play:
			<p>
			Carmelita (by Warren Zevon) - B52 (by the Perfect Disaster) - Magic Bus (by The Who)
			<p>
			During B52 I look up and see Kevin Haskins walking into the Labour Club. He's over in town for the weekend
			and apparently someone has told him that I was playing an acoustic set. Well, them's the breaks. Acoustic
			night just turned into mental, churning acid rock frenzy night.
			<p>
			An encore was attempted but Joe had seized the bass and I couldn't get any noise out of the guitar (I expect
			he broke it), so I fled the stage, leaving Joe and Jon to pass a contented ten minutes or so re-inventing
			progressive rock somewhere along the Can/Pink Floyd axis of evil. Off to the Charles Bradlaugh to catch up
			with Kevin on this most unlikely of Saturday nights at the Labour.

		The Shakedown DJs have harnessed this suppressed rage and plan on unleashing it all over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. We've paired up

		to descend as the sun rises over the Shire on Monday morning, bringing with it a new dawn of peace.

			Masters of Budvar present our headliner: TIM KEEGAN
			<p>
			I first saw Tim Keegan play in 1986, when he was still a student and his band opened for the JBC. He has been making music ever since, leading his
			bands Homer, The Homer Lounge and The Departure Lounge through a succession of delicious recordings and worldwide concert tours. He has collaborated
			with Robin Hitchcock and played in the Blue Aeroplanes' veritable Foreign Legion of ace guitar-slingers. He is in the front rank of original British
			songwriters, comparable with Ray Davies, Morrissey or Boo Hewerdine. I don't - at this stage - know in what format he will be appearing, but he is
			somebody that I have dreamed of booking for Masters of Budvar since we opened, and I have no doubt that - however he presents his music - he is
			guaranteed to be sensational.
			<p>
			Masters of Budvar present our guests: THE MAX EIDER EXPERIENCE
			<p>
			Ladies and gentlemen, the elegantly-wasted JBC guitar supremo has himself a supergroup. On the drums is June Miles-Kingston, who drummed and sang on
			about 85% of all listenable British hits of the nineteen-eighties. Remember the cool girlie harmonies on those calssic Funboy Three singles? June. On
			guitar is Simon Mawby, whose past credits include tours and records with The Woodentops, The House of Love and The Communards. On bass, flying in from
			Los Angeles, is Mister Steven "Twin Cadillac" Valentine, bass player of the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, and on guitar and vocals, none other than the man
			himself, ${max}. And their first ever performance? Why, it's right here at Masters of Budvar. And it's at nine-thirty, so don't even consider being
			late.
			<p>
			Masters of Budvar present our guests: THE NEW MOON
			<p>
			Making a welcome return to Masters of Budvar, Matt Sewell and his posse from Oxford bring a lovely, swirling acoustic sound with shades of Hitchcock

			<p>
			It's at the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton on Friday 2nd September 2005. It's free to get in, the vibes are friendly, the beer is cheap, the
			lights are pretty, the PA is warm and the speeches are short. Doors are open from 7:30pm and the first act will take the stage at nine o'clock sharp.
			The Masters of Budvar thank you.

			Tim Keegan
			<p>
			Tim Keegan has been on the Masters of Budvar wish-list since we opened. He is a super-talented British songwriter. For several years Tim and his band
			Departure Lounge were based in Nashville, Tennessee. There they made a brace of albums which garnered all manner of critical acclaim. Their 1999 waxing
			"Out Of Here" is a classic late night record, required listening for those who value the Velvet Underground's third album, Leonard Cohen or the tender
			(dark) side of the Perfect Disaster. More recently Tim lived and recorded in Paris, where he worked with ace French producer Kid Loco. He has also
			toured and recorded with Robin Hitchcock (he can be seen in Jonathan Demme's "Storefront Hitchcock" movie) and played guitar with the Blue Aeroplanes.
			Now he is back in the UK and making a rare and precious solo appearance right here in Northampton. Did you dig Micky Greaney or Ramon de Juan when they
			played? Come see Tim.
			<p>
			${max} & His Orchestra
			<p>
			You may well know Max Eider as the exceptional guitarist with The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy or David J. You know the guy: tall and elegantly wasted with
			a sound like a tripped-out Wes Montgomery and fingers that grown men find troubling to gaze upon. His 1987 album "The Best Kisser In The World" is a
			much sought-after collector's item, and his 2001 release "Hotel Figueroa" even earned him column inches in Forbes Magazine! Tonight, for the first
			time, he presents his all-star orchestra, featuring Steven "Twin Cadillac" Valentine (bass) and Pat Beirne (harmonica) from the current JBC line-up,
			along with vocalist Lynda Skulpone (from Los Angeles underground band Saltypop), guitarist Simon Mawby (who has played with the Woodentops, Jimmy
			Somerville and the House of Love) and world-class drummer and vocalist June Miles-Kingston (who has played with everybody from Funboy Three to
			Everything But The Girl). Expect the lushest of loungecore backing to provide the perfect setting for Eider's bittersweet songwriting skills. Find out
			more than you need to know at: www.maxeider.com
			<p>
			The New Moon
			<p>
			Hailing from Oxford and boasting one of the finest bassists to grace our club, the New Moon made their Masters of Budvar debut last November. They
			specialise in a kind of psychedelic folk music, spinning out great tumbling chord sequences with powerful vocals soaring way up there above. Comparable
			to the aforementioned Mr. Hitchcock or perhaps Jeff Buckley, the New Moon make a surprisingly muscular sound that repays your attention in spades. They
			are also the only band in the world currently known to have a song about Terry Walpole and his camera.
			<p>
			This all kicks off at 8:30pm

			SLIPSTREAM
			<p>
			You know these guys by now. These super-professional psychedelic rockers (with a string of top flight credits as long as the M6) played
			two magical sets at Masters of Budvar last year, two of the best nights we have had. Now we are delighted to welcome Mark Refoy and Jon
			Mattock back to the cheery confines of the Labour Club once again. At a recent soundcheck their computer died on them, forcing them to
			alter their set list at the very last minute. Having seen the ensuing set, I'm happy to report that the technical whoopsie-daisie didn't
			seem to phaze them in the slightest. A huge, barrelling wall of spaced-out sonority, simple melodies sweetly sung and a drummer to marvel
			at.

			KEVIN BUXTON and KONTRA BAND
			<p>
			Riding in from the badlands of Wellingborough with his trusty team of pistoleros in tow comes a man who has clearly done a lot of living,
			and taken the time to chronicle it all in his sharply-observed, poignant songs. His recent album "Through Any Window" offers a range of
			thoughtful character studies and wry reflections on a full life richly lived. The music is deceptively simple and inviting, but cast
			about with mysterious and faintly intimidating ambient shadows, perhaps along the lines of one of John Cale's early solo albums. (He's
			got a song about cowboys, too.) When our Masters of Budvar talent scouts last clocked Kevin and the band they were grinding out a truly
			frightening tune about Robert Johnson, the Devil and...well, you should just come and see for yourselves.

			CHARLIE BARNARD
			<p>
			Charlie Barnard comes from Milton Keynes, where he used to front a band called The Dead Girls. He is a charming solo performer, with a
			very English take on the dark side of psychedelia. We first saw him at Beat Wednesday, where his resemblance to a young Peter Perrett
			held an awful fascination for our talent scouts and indeed for Glenn Hoddle's cousin, who happened to be passing through at the time.
			There are also more than a few flashes of Syd Barrett about when Charlie sings. Altogether, then, the signs are that he'll probably
			disappear off the face of the Earth when he's about 28, so catch him now would be our advice!

			This month - for one lovely, tranquil month only - the Masters of Budvar return to their original brief as a showcase for acoustic singer songwriters. And we

			twenty years, plus a top supporting cast of talent from NN1 and around. So...

			DAVE KUSWORTH
			<p>
			There are a few precious people who are truly, irrevocably rock and roll to the bone.
			<p>
			Birmingham's prodigal son Dave Kusworth is one of them. He is also the kind of songwriter who can play his songs all on his own with just an acoustic guitar and
			his unearthly voice and hold you spellbound, no less rock and roll than if he were fronting a full-on electric band with a ten-piece horn section. The boy just
			can't help it.
			<p>
			Dave Kusworth has been playing professionally since 1977, and at the turn of the eighties he founded The Hawks with the great Micky Greaney and a teenaged Steven
			Duffy (last sighted writing the songs on Robbie Williams' new album, for goodness' sake!) He toured and recorded with UK rock legends the Dogs D'Amour before
			hooking up with the Swell Maps' Nikki Sudden to record several albums for Glass Records, Creation Records and Glitterhouse Records under the name of The
			Jacobites. He has toured all over the world and his wild, cracked, heartbreaking songs have been covered by The Lemonheads and Mercury Rev.
			<p>
			As I write this, Dave has just returned from touring Germany with his band (where he was joined onstage in Berlin by Sudden) and he has just completed his
			umpteenth album, the particularly magnificent "Silver Blades". He will be appearing solo and acoustic at Masters of Budvar, offering a rare and unmissable insight
			into his astonishing knack for writing simple but devastatingly effective rock and roll songs. As a writer and as a frontline rock and roll road warrior, Dave
			really is in the same league as Peter Perrett or Keith Richards. We are honoured to host him and we hope that, come closing time, you will love him, yea, even as
			we love him.
			<p>
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.davekusworth.com)}
			<p>
			PAUL COX & JOE WOOLLEY
			<p>
			Masters of Budvar regulars will be familiar with the elegant balladeering style of Northampton artist Paul Cox. Now he joins up with the irrepressible Joe Woolley
			on electric guitar, bringing a whole new range of dynamic power and colour to his songs. Check out this collaboration and be amazed.
			<p>
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.paulmcox.com)}
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.joewoolley.com)}
			<p>
			CHARLIE BARNARD
			<p>
			From Milton Keynes, Charlie Barnard is a more than promising young talent, very English and very psychedelic. He made his Masters of Budvar debut last month
			supporting Slipstream, and his slightly sinister, wide-eyed songwriting combined with his uncanny take on the Syd Barrett guitar sound induced us to ask him back
			straight away for another shot at establishing a foothold upon the NN1 scene. Worth getting in early for!
			<p>
			${g_artistweb(g=http://www.lemonrock.com/charlie)}
			<p>
			As usual, the Labour Club welcomes all comers from 8:00pm and as usual entry is free. We hope to see you there.

			THE IMPORTERS
			<p>
			Based in Earls Barton, home of the mighty Phoenix Soundworks and the

			The Importers make a bright and breezy electronic pop sound, melodic,

			and recording busily, so we expect them to be on top form for this
			night.
			<p>

			Featuring Gregg Cave on guitar alongside another acoustic guitarist and
			a cellist, this brand new band describe themselves as "A fusion of
			contemporary and classical sounds with folk roots around the edges".

			PAT FISH

			Skuff karaoke from your genial and twisted host. Expect electric guitar,
