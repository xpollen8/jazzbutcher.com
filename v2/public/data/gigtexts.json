I got home and Alice said, 'Pat, they want us to support Bauhaus at Hammersmith Pallais.\" I thought, 'FREAK OUT! GET A BAND!\" <p/> So we rounded up a few people, we got Rolo (McGinty, guitarist-The Woodentops) and Alice and Max and me and this sax player we used to know. <p/> We went up there and they hated us, it was brilliant. There was 2,000 people going, \"FUCK OFF! FUCK OFF AND DIE!\" We'd never been on a stage where there'd been guerrillas to protect us from the audience, but this time there was, so we thought, 'Great! Now we'll do 'Partytime'. Now we'll do 'Love Kittens'', and we just played all these ballads at these rabid gothics, it was great. <p/> And they hated us. After the show, I said to Kevin, 'Well, thanks for asking us to do it, mate. It was quite an experience.' And he said, 'It wasn't me.' And it turned out it was his big brother, Dave, who I'd never met at that stage. <p/> We just got on really well. We all sort of started hanging out. When he joined the band, we knew he was going to leave again. He joined officially for six months, but he ended up doing about ten."},{"gigtext_id":1051,"datetime":"1982-11-01","type":"review","credit":"Andrew Brooksbank","credit_date":"2025-02-06","body":"<h2>Excerpt from Bauhaus Omnibus box set (2025):</h2> <p/><b>PAT FISH</b>: <p/> <a href=\"/press/19820905_press_mercuryandherald.html\">In September of ’82 the local paper</a> got wind that we were working on an album (Bath of Bacon) and they published a desperately ahead-of-the-game story about that. The album, of course, wouldn’t actually be released until May the following year! To be honest I was pleased about the coverage, but really didn’t think that anybody would read it or remember it. So imagine my surprise when I came home from work one night in October to find my girlfriend waiting with a barely credible story about how I had to contact some bloke to secure a support slot with Bauhaus at the Hammersmith Palais. The whole thing seemed totally unreal, and to be honest I suspected a wind up. I had met Kevin (Haskins) once or twice by this point, so I vaguely assumed that he was behind this. We lined up as Rolo Mcginty on bass, Louis Leroi on sax, Alice Thompson was issued with a Casio and accidentally started her pop career (shortly afterwards forming the Woodentops with Rolo), Max Eider on electric guitar and myself acoustic and vocals. I remember that we had a guest list allowance too, so we smuggled in loads of mates under the spurious guises of “manager” or “hairdresser” and felt incredibly smug that we had “got away with it”. <p/> We opened the show that night. We started with Partytime. Let me just say that we had not yet reached the days when we could start with this number and silence a room full of people. Well, in fact these were the days when we started with Partytime and – within seconds – were facing a full-on howl of hostility. <p/> Their (Bauhaus) chart success had attracted loads of new fans who cared nothing for Northampton or, indeed, for most of Bauhaus’ collected works…they were there to see the funny-looking blokes play Ziggy and that was that. The last thing they wanted to see or hear was a bunch of normal-looking kids playing nightclub music over a primitive drum machine. <p/> It was actually really exhilarating. Throughout the half-hour set the distant roar of outrage and contempt ebbed and flowed as we ploughed through things like Love Kittens. I remember looking at the nervous security boys in front of the stage and thinking “Ahaaaa…THAT’s what you guys are for…brilliant!” We knew that nobody could actually hurt us, so on we went, delighted that we could elicit such a reaction and still keep going. <p/> We finished with Zombie Love. We did get some applause, and I do know that some people who were there that night went on to follow our band, some even up to the present day. But my chief memory is of an awful lot of folks who had just decided to “become Goths” being really, really angry that we had even showed up. <p/> After we played, of course, we got plastered and I remember talking to Kevin and ventured to thank him for inviting us onto the bill. He looked genuinely baffled and denied anything to do with it….it was only a year or so later that I finally found out that Kev’s big brother had seen that rather premature article in the local paper and decided to invite these weirdoes so that he could find out what they were about. Of course, before long he ended up finding out more about us than he probably ever needed to know."},{"gigtext_id":5,"datetime":"1983-06-25","type":"recording","credit_date":null,"body":"<span class=\"recording_media\">Walkman</span>, Quality: <span class=\"recording_quality\">5</span> (out of 10), Performance: <span class=\"recording_peformance\">C</span>"},{"gigtext_id":12,"datetime":"1984-07-20","type":"review","credit":"Vivonzeureux!","credit_url":"http://vivonzeureux.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-nice-way-to-turn-seventeen-2.html","credit_date":"2013-06-22","body":"It is at the very end of my stay in London, July 20, 1984, I finally saw The Jazz Butcher at the Living Room, with Spit Like Paint and Vee VV in the first part.

We were supposed to do 2 numbers, this one and Big Saturday. For an eternity we milled around in the Tyne Tees TV studio in Newcastle while the telly people piddled about with their telly nonsense. Occasionally we would be summoned at great haste (as though this was all somehow our fault) and given a quick run-through of our tunes for levels and so on. Whoever was mixing our shit was not to be seen, but his voice would boom out of the monitors and boss us around in some way or other. We took to calling this person \"God.\" God seemed to appreciate this and our brief rehearsals all went well enough. <p/> During rehearsals I had one of the most humiliating experiences of my \"career\"...well, life, really. This was February 1986 and there was a Valentine's card that I needed to send. During one of the endless lulls that we generally passed smoking bales of hashish (we seemed to have some particularly fine stuff with us on this trip, though I can no longer recall whether or not we went out of our way to get Special Dope for The Telly), I strode out into Newcastle city centre. I found myself entering an enormous edifice that I knew to be one of the largest shopping centres in Europe at the time. <p/> I figured that a card shop would not be long in appearing but I was mistaken. I wandered deeper and deeper into this shopping mall, turning corners and getting no closer to finding a stationers of any kind. In the back of my mind I had a vague recollection of Ariadne and Theseus in the Labyrinth and I was doing my best to remember how I had come. I was deep in there, though, and deeper still before I found a place that would sell me a card, an envelope and a stamp. <p/> Of course, on emerging from the card shop, my surroundings made no sense to me at all. By sheer luck I stumbled across some manner of back exit and made good my escape from the massive mall. Of course, I had emerged in a spot far, far away from the place where I had entered. I had no clue as to where I was and all that I could see, curving up the street, was the huge, monolithic outer wall of the shopping centre...as far as the eye could see! <p/> I was lost and I had to admit it. I was going to have to speak to a native. I had no great confidence that I would even understand any directions that I might be given in the local dialect. It all sounded like animal innards sluicing down a dreadful drain in a cold and stinky place to me. For that matter, as I stood there bewildered in the afternoon sun with my stupid hair and clothes, I had no great confidence that the natives would do anything other than batter me relentlessly until I resembled a fairly lumpy bowl of beetroot soup. <p/> Eventually a native hove into view. To my delight, it was a fairly ordinary-looking middle-aged lady, probably out to do her shopping. I approached her confidently for directions. And then, just before I addressed her, it hit me, the absurdity of what I was now going to have to say to her. With my mind overbrimming with mortification and self-disgust, I found myself saying to this perfectly nice Northern lady: \"Excuse me, dear. Could you possibly tell me the way to the television studios?\" <p/> You can't hang around a tv studio for very long without witnessing a couple of moments that make you question your will to live. An early warning came at about four o'clock on the first afternoon. Over on the other stage stood the songwriting genius Stephen Duffy, still wearing his raincoat, with his electric guitar hanging limp and untouched around his waist. He had recently had a bit of a hit with some piece of pop fluff that he had written and you could now see the terrible, terrible regret on his face as he stood motionless among his gnarled and yet oddly faceless record-company \"pro\" band members as they bashed out a useless, chillingly efficient Aryan 12 bar blues around him. <p/> A couple of days later I was milling around the arse end of the studio, killing some time, when I saw a big old white Rolls-Royce come rolling into the delivery bay. Standing back a little to stay inconspicuous, I waited to see which big old pop star would emerge from the vehicle. One by one the members of Sigue Sigue Sputnik stepped out on their ridiculous stack heels. Once they were all out of the motor, though, they didn't really seem to know what to do next. I was puzzled. Then somebody came up to them and spoke a few words. All the members of the band got back into the Roller, which then reversed back up the loading bay. Then it came back down again. And the band all got out again. <p/> That's when I realised. They were rehearsing getting out of a car. <p/> We were bored as arseholes for most of the time. It's just as well that we had all that quality hash because, back at our cheap but rather nice suburban hotel, we were drinking like cunts and there was a definite edge in the air. There was a lot of paranoia about our distributors at the time and one night, sat at the bar, Eider, Jonesy and I started laying into Dave Barker something proper. \"Where's the fucking money?\" would probably just about have summed up the gist of our fifteen minute tirade. Dave, as pissed as we were, rode it out incredibly gracefully, though, of course, at the time we just took it for bloody-minded recalcitrance. Eventually we wore ourselves out with the griping. There was a brief silence. All three musicians were somehow hoping that, now that we had done enough shouting, The Truth would be unveiled. As I say, were pissed as cunts. <p/> Silence. Slitty-eyed anticipation. And then D. Elvis Barker turns to me and he says: \"Pat...I love the USA.\" <p/> This was February 1986. <p/> Well, as I say, we hung around Newcastle for two or three days to play six minutes of live music. When we turned up \"on the day\" we were told that we would, in fact, only be playing one number. Paula Yates was back from the far east with news of Madonna's new movie or something, so the live bands had to be cut to allow this important cultural bombshell to be aired. (Paula Yates, it transpired, was actually a lot nicer and less up-herself than Jooles Holland.) <p/> So, here we are. Three days to prepare to do three minutes of music on the fucking telly. Mitch Jenkins showed up with some even better quality hash and, in our tiny, windowless dressing room, we fell upon it like fiends. You could not see in that little room. <p/> And yet...and yet...and yet...As soon as we get up there on the flapping stage we start playing as though we have an urgrent appointment somewhere else! <p/> I particularly like Owen's desperate attempts to sing and smile at the same time (we had been discussing this a lot and he doubtless thought he was being well ironic, not realising that camera just ended up making him look like a psycho!) Jooles appeared to take the ending of the tune as some kind of personal affront. Given that we'd been doing that on and off for the past three days, you might have thought that The Great Musician might have figured out that this was just the way that the tune ended. <p/> We were in the pub before it was dark."},{"gigtext_id":36,"datetime":"1986-02-27","type":"recording","credit_date":null,"body":"<span class=\"recording_media\">Walkman</span>, Quality: <span class=\"recording_quality\">5</span> (out of 10), Performance: <span class=\"recording_peformance\">A</span>"},{"gigtext_id":37,"datetime":"1986-02-27","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"The band are getting quite good, though...

This is definitely nowhere near one of my better recordings. <p /> So, at the end of the show during the encore for 'Caroline Wheeler's' & 'Sweet Jane\", all of the guitarists in the Blue Aeroplanes jumped up on stage to join in. The singer from the the Blue Aeroplanes also joined in plus that guy who used to just dance around on stage with them. Some of the guitars were not even plugged in but they were playing. I can't remember how many guitarists were up on stage but it was madness. So many people on this little stage all performing. btw- The Blue Aeroplanes were the opening act."},{"gigtext_id":117,"datetime":"1990-11-13 12:00:00","type":"review","credit":"David Whittemore","credit_date":null,"body":"we go to rough trade where pat does an interview and we watch a bit of the boston show video.

They were set up a little differently than in Boston. Instead of having the sax. and bass? ( or was it guitar) in back, all members were in front -- I liked it. They all seemed to have more of the spotlight, whereas before Pat and the long-hair on top guitarist seemed to have most of the limelight.

Any glockenspiels are probably down to me. <p/> Richard and I went on to try and rub the project up into a finished album with a big session at Woodhouse in November 92 (during which Richard also got into glockenspiel action, as I recall), but although we committed a further ten or so backing tracks (including the truly awesome \"My Milkfloat\" featuring a casio playing \"My Desert\" to itself under a barrage of early sixties electric milkfloat noises, which Richard insisted sounded just like Jimi Hendrix), we never finished them off. I still have the instrumental roughs at home. Richard and I often talked of finishing it all off, but neither of us likes the phone very much and it never got done. <p/> I have spotted bits and pieces from some of those aborted tracks showing up on Richard's Triumph 2000 LP. <p/> According to my cassette, we recorded five numbers: <ol> <li>A Matter of Time (which was a 13FG number)</li> <li>Bombed (by Richard, which was featured on the Autumn 93 jbc European tour)</li> <li>Pedby's Grace (by me and Sumishta)</li> <li>Colour Waltz (by me and Richard)</li> <li>Elwood (by Sumishta and me)</li> </ol>"},{"gigtext_id":146,"datetime":"1991-08-01","type":"recording","credit_date":null,"body":"Quality: <span class=\"recording_quality\">8</span> (out of 10), Performance: <span class=\"recording_peformance\">A</span>, Interest: <span class=\"recording_interest\">B</span> (out of 10), Generation: <span class=\"recording_generation\">1</span>, <span class=\"recording_media\">DAT</span>"},{"gigtext_id":147,"datetime":"1991-08-01","type":"bootlegger","credit":"David Whittemore","credit_date":null},{"gigtext_id":148,"datetime":"1991-08-01","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"This version was recorded by Cole Coonce (Braindead Sound Machine) and myself at the Nitronic Research Wind Tunnels, Silverlake, California in August1991 when I was hiding out in L.A.

We play a set that is not as fine as the last two, but remains well up to standard, which is just as well as the representatives of our Tokyo paymasters, Sony, are here to check out what sort of cak McGee has been sending them. Actually, I recognise two of the Sony folk from earlier times, when they were just-fans, so the diplomacy thing isn't too demanding, after all. We also do two very silly interviews for various US Forces networks. Tonight was the first show to sell out completely. We'd been a little concerned that the crowds of around 200 were a bit on the thin side, but were deeply reassured when Uli told us about what had been happening to other, supposedly more \"happening\" British groups on this front.

I tell him I take the elevator. The show is competent, but a bit dull, but you could never say that of the Hotel Beau Site. Yeah, the site might be great (actually, it's on a huge grey stone boulevard that reminds us of Moscow) but the furnishings have to be seen to be believed. And the drains have to be heard!

In between trying to calm Samba down and get him to do his job, not ours, and avoiding slow poisoning from the world's most lard-infested \"mushroom pate\", we do, in fact, assemble a rather splendid JBC Acoustic Soul Revue. Curtis opened up, playing his own numbers and a couple of blues classics. Michael then delivered half a dozen songs from his wonderful Spittle Rattle repertoire before the JBC took over, doing two band sets sandwiched around a bunch of solo numbers from the big fella.

Surely soon comes the day when Pat is pesonally acquainted with every single purchaser of his latest album... <p/> Anyway, it was good to see the man again, and I can break the news (which Jim Murray for some reason found unworthy of mention) that Pat is now the proud owner of a rather fetching goatee. <p/> The music? Well, we missed the openers by Curtis, cos we were in the bar asking Pat about the new album (has a good song about dolphins, 'pparently). Then the oddly familiar sound of <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/david_j.html\">David J.</a> </span>'s voice (to someone who has never listened to his solo stuff) summoned us into the music tent.

Pat claimed defensively that the 3 or 4 songs they played from the new album, they had played together for the first time only the day before, but everything came together regardless. A particular stunner was a kindof inverted version of \"<span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/excellent.html\">Excellent!</a></i> </span>\", called something like \"I hate!\", which involves Dooj shouting an awful lot. <p/> Plenty of other great songs, oldies too, including <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/caroline_wheeler.html\">Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present</a></i> </span> and <span class='song'> <i>Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)</i> </span>. <p/> But the most amazing thing about this gig, as opposed to all others?

Incredible mix of <b>Beatsongs</b> and <b>Life Model</b>. New one Detective Snog kissable, but where's Angelo? Is there something I don't know? Of course. <p/> But hey, you want to hear about *Saturday* and Pat. This was probably the best gig in the world, from where we were standing. Tim Keegan provided a short sweet set of three numbers, and won the hearts of all present. A keen JBC fanatic, he used to be in a band called Ringo, who did nowt, but with his good looks and his sharp lyrics, he *will* go far. Mulreany and Allen wheeled out the same set as last night, and again the only good bits were Rodney's <i>Fun</i> and their Beatles number, <i>Driving Me Mad</i>. But what do I know? It's a lot better than I could do. By the way, the girl behind me thought Mulreany was Paul Weller. Then oh my goodness! It's the Butcher. If only Dylan sightings were as rare and full of excitement. Three songs, all excellent, all well-received. The third was, I think, <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/cute_submarines.html\">Cute Submarines</a></i> </span>. Radical. Too fucking short. More more more. <p/> Then the Blue Aeroplanes set. Even better than last night, although someone extracted my wallet from my front jeans pocket. Yeah, I felt it, but too late to figure out who in the crowd had taken it. If you want to know how good the gig was, just think: this didn't spoil my evening. Made a mental note to cancel the cards, and threw myself back into it all. If you've never seen the Blue Aeroplanes, do so now! Before anything happens to them. And then see them again. Afterwards. Claim you always loved them. That much will be true. Take it off and deny it. <i>Daughter Movie</i>, <i>Yr Own World</i>, <i>Detective Song</i>, <i>Colour Me</i>, <i>I'm A Smart Drug</i>, <i>Broken and Mended</i>, <i>Ghost-Nets</i>, <i>Jacket Hangs</i>, and <i>Vade Mecum Gunslinger</i>. The first night ended with fifteen people on stage. Most of them with guitars. All but one plugged in. The second night was a leetle more chaotic, with Gerard gunning the works. This time, two guitarists ended up unplugged, but the remainder, including Pat, of course, left us senseless. And in my case, broke. But it was worth it. Well worth it.

Pat looked good in his suit, but got lost behind his shades (a bad decision), and the whole gig felt slightly hurried (Blues For Dead Dean Reed at what seemed like double tempo) and slightly impersonal: he didn't talk between songs as much as at last year's Acoustic Conspiracy gigs, though there was a good story about Pete Astor, a capo, and an adventurous german woman.

Also caught John Otway at the Weavers just before we left - hadn't seen him since '84, but he's as good as ever, and has really developed as a comedian - the talk side of his show is very good without being too polished.

Johnson. He had been over once before to play in the bars, and was now negotiating some further dates with our friends there, The Purelove. <p />Once Max and I got wind of the plan, we thought that if we came along too, it might scare up a slightly larger audience for the Bald One to play to. <p />Besides, that way we would be able to get in on the free beer. <p /> <p />Through the magic of e-mail we colluded with The Purelove boys to make it happen. Meanwhile Owen Jones, old school JBC drummer and Hamburg resident, returned from his trip to the Himalayas, and Max's harmonica-toting pal Pat Byrne joined up for the trip as well. Along with Owen's girlfriend Baerbel, the Great <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/kathie_mcginty.html\">Kathie McGinty</a> </span> and our guitarist pal Nikki Whittaker we had built ourselves quite a posse by the time that we gathered in Hamburg. <p /> <p />A date had been sorted out at the Logo club in Grindelallee, and the Purelove boys had undertaken the task of promotion. They did better than many of the professionals, getting our picture in all the papers. But what a picture! Particularly unkind to your ageing and toothless correspondent, you'll be delighted to learn. We feared for our wages when we saw it! <p /> <p />Still, it didn't deter 250 or so brave souls who came out on a wet Friday night to see the show. A couple came from England, some from Berlin, and one heroic couple from Olympia, Washington, USA. We tried to buy them a beer, but the barman wouldn't let us pay. Back in the dressing room this proved to be the case in many respects. A large posse of our Hamburger friends were there, edging around the Great Clemens Kinder, who had set up a full-on mobile studio in there in between the sandwiches and the beer. <p /> <p />After the room filled up I was forced by the Hamburg Police to introduce our one-man <I>Vorgruppe</I>, Curtis E. Johnson. I did my best to be encouraging and friendly, but I guess it all went a bit Robbie Williams. As I stepped back into the dressing room, leaving Curt to his fate, Max appeared and declared in warm, congratulatory tones, <p />\"That was truly ... nauseating.\" <p /> <p />Shortly afterwards Nikki took me aside, urgently pleading: <p />\"When I come on to do my tune ... <I>please</I> don't introduce me!\" <p /> <p />Curtis went straight at the crowd, and although he later confessed to feeling nervous, he won them over with the first two or three songs. As he began to play Dougie MacClean's \"Caledonia\", Max, Owen and I found ourselves alone in the dressing room. Each of us sat in a chair, listening intently to this incredible tune. As we sat there, filling up, the door opened and a friend of a friend stood there. He came in, looked around, hung up his coat, then left. Nobody said a word the whole time. I caught up with him later and said \"You must think we're very strange people.\" But it was the tune. When you hear Curtis sing it, you'll want to stop for a second too. It's a travelling song, but it's about memories and home and love, too. He couldn't have played a sweeter version for three old boys with a history, sitting in the place that they all associate with all that magic stuff possibly more than any other. The moment would have made the whole trip worthwhile for me if it had all stopped there. <p /> <p />But <I>did </I>it all stop there, Churchill? <p />\"Oh NO.\" <p /> <p />For his last tune Curtis was going to do \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", and he had invited Pat to play harp with him on that tune. Pat spent most of the tune standing on stage looking for the appropriate harp before realising that he simply didn't have that one on board and leaving again. Curt collapsed laughing and promptly buggered the connection on his guitar. He made a graceful exit, sliding down those last four bluesy chords acoustic and leaving the stage to great applause. <p /> <p />After a few minutes of mindless fun with the stage curtains, Max and I found ourselves on stage. For the first part of our set we were alone on the stage, playing as a duo. One by one our pals would come out and join us to help out on a particular tune. We had done the usual sort of shit with candles, but we had also brought with us our secret weapon: <p />The Executaire. <p />As each musician joined us on stage we would greet him and pour him a glass of his favourite spirit from The Executaire, a 1950s style travel bar which was kindly donated to the cause by Bigrig Industries of San Francisco in 1997, and which we had filled for a stupidly low price with German Brandy, Russian Vodka and Mexican Tequila. <p />Apparently, a lot of the audience thought at first that we called Pat \"The Executaire\" (and it is only fair to point out that he is a bit of a natty dresser), but as more and more folks came on and had a drink they began to see what was going on. <p /> <p />Here is the set that we played. <p /> <p />Partytime <br/>Whaddya? <br/>What's the Matter, Boy? <br/>Raking Up Leaves (Pat on harp) <br/>Soul Happy Hour (Owen on triangle and vocals) <br/>It has to be You (Pat on harp) <br/>Just Like Betty Page <br/>Angels <br/>Girls Who Keep Goldfish (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Nikki and Max on electric guitars, me on acoustic guitar) <br/>DRINK (Owen on drums vocals and kazoo, Pat on harp) <br/>Baby, It's You (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Curtis on bongos) <br/>The New World (Owen on snare drum, Pat on harp) <br/>Old Snakey (Owen on snare, Pat on harp) <br/>The Human Jungle (Owen on bongos and vocals, Pat on harp) <br/>Who Loves You Now?

We'd had a great time and made ourselves a little money. The show had a really warm vibe. At times it felt like we were getting away with murder, but at the same time we sort of knew that what we were doing was all right. My favourite moment came in \"Goldfish\" where it turned out that Max and Nikki had a plan : they both played the guitar solo simultaneously! I sat there strumming on my acoustic laughing my head off. To think that some unlucky bastards can't even find one good guitarist. Some guys have all the luck. In Hamburg anyway. <p /> <p />We spent the subsequent weekend having all kinds of twisted fun. Curtis gatecrashed a blues night in a pub, met (and got autographed by) Hamburg's most celebrated hooker, ran away from a predatory circus owner, lost his crabs in the fish market at dawn and never went to bed ever. The rest of us prowled from The Onion to the Bar Zentrale, stopping in at a bar that somebody had named after Max where we played table football and drank nameless shorts of various colours. As Max said, even in Hamburg terms we had an extreme time. <p /> <p />By Monday night we were all back home, older if not wiser, and looking forward to the showdown with Martin Stephenson at the Racehorse in Northampton on Friday. <p /> <p />Viva La Executaire! <p /> <p />&copy; Pat Fish 1999"},{"gigtext_id":339,"datetime":"1999-03-05","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"There is a gig at the Racehorse pub Abington street Northampton UK with Martin Stephenson and the Toe Rags, The Jazz Butcher, & Max Eider, & Curtis E Johnson on 5/3/99"},{"gigtext_id":1003,"datetime":"1999-03-05","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"The Northampton show was good fun.

Very nice people, too. <p /> A Tuesday night in Portland only yielded an audience of about a hundred, but despite this and the fact that the band sat down to play, it was arguably the best set of the trip so far in purely musical terms.

We had a really wonderful time staying at their green and peaceful house, despite the best efforts of their dog Fern to keep us up all night playing frisbee. <p /> So we arrived well rested at the Crocodile Cafe to enjoy Pilsner Urquell and engage in a bizarre debate as to whether the club management should dismantle the internal walls of the club for our show. Of course, we went for the most destructive option and down came the wall! Just as well, because a large and enthusiastic crowd gathered, no doubt prompted by some seriously flattering local press. In the absence of a support act the JBC opened for themselves, rather in the manner of the San Francisco show. <p /> Both sets went well, with the band set being a bit more raucous than at Portland, largely on account of the Butcher being back up on his feet. The crowd responded warmly perhaps a bit too warmly in the case of a bunch of nutters who shouted in fake British accents and threw ice at the stage throughout. In fact, the Butcher took an ice cube in the eye just at the start of Roadrunner. No matter, it'll take more than that to put a stop to our unwholesome activities. Later the Butcher was accosted by two of the aforementioned loonies, who were dead keen to point out that throwing shit at the stage was a \"mark of respect\" in Seattle. Funnily enough, nobody else we met in Seattle could back up this dubious assertion, but then maybe nobody else we met in Seattle regularly goes to gigs by Tad's Respect is also due to the fans who broke out of Canada for the evening and came down from Vancouver to see us. <p /> The show was taped (off the board, I suspect, from the rather \"boxy\" vocal-heavy sound) by Brent Aliverti, whose e-mail address is: <a href=\"mailto:brenta_ms@email.msn.com\">brenta_ms@email.msn.com</a> <p /> Audience: About 350 <p /> Line-up: Pat, Max, Owen, Steve"},{"gigtext_id":348,"datetime":"1999-09-23 12:00:00","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"At lunchtime Max and the Butcher visited WNYU where we recorded an interview and a bunch of acoustic versions, recorded on borrowed guitars, which gave us a whole new kind of groove in the fingers of the left hand."},{"gigtext_id":349,"datetime":"1999-09-23 20:00:00","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"We arrived in New York to check into our atmospheric hotel on The Bowery and to be re-united with Kevin, whose pal Mark took us on a splendid drinking expedition around the Lower East Side. Quite by chance we ended up in the promoter local at about three in the morning. <p /> At lunchtime Max and the Butcher visited WNYU where we recorded an interview and a bunch of acoustic versions, recorded on borrowed guitars, which gave us a whole new kind of groove in the fingers of the left hand. <p /> Sound-check was a confused affair, owing to the fact that we had to assemble equipment from all over the place, none of which was familiar to us. Many thanks to everyone who helped out! Things were further complicated by certain members of the group locking their guitars in their cases and leaving the keys on the other side of Manhattan. Then there was all the rest of it random feedback, electric shocks... it was all happening! As Kevin pointed out, if the Bad Sound-check/Good Show rule was holding good, then this should be the very devil of a concert <p /> First, however, came the opening band, charmingly entitled Asseaters UK. Love that... touch! They were only playing their first gig, but they had a great bottom end with a fine rhythm section and Todd scratching in samples off his decks. Them as likes their Happy Mondays and such should get along and check them out. Their set was short but sweet and went down well with everyone except those few deluded loonies who had convinced themselves that the opening act would turn out to be Love and Rockets <p /> Overheard in the ladies' lavatory just before the show: So do you think this is really the Butcher's last show? Naaah... they've lied before. <p /> Somebody had, indeed, advertised this as the last Butcher show, but we all know that that was back in December 1995, right? Taking the stage I told them that it was certainly the last JBC show in America this century. Seemed safe enough at the time. <p /> Max and I went on to start things rolling. As the first notes of \"Partytime\" began to roll it became clear that Max had left the heavy distorted sound on his guitar. Oh how we laughed! Luckily he got himself sorted pretty damn quick. Things settled down after that and we played a fairly sweet opening section, with special guest <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/pat_beirne.html\">Pat Beirne</a> </span> joining in on his harmonica only hours after arriving in the USA. Kevin arrived for a storming version of \"Dracula\", but then everything went silent in the rhythm guitar department... it turned out that a fuse had blown in my borrowed JC120 and nobody had any spares in the house. <p /> We spent an incredibly frustrated ten minutes lurking in the dressing room, and even had to beat off one or two punters who thought that we had already finished. Finally Bob the house sound man came up with an inventive solution to the fuse problem and we were able to carry on. <p /> From there on the set was hard and manic, and the vibe was grand.

Schneck","credit_date":null,"body":"<h2>Because I Found Out Already What Makes My Heart Sing:</h2> <b>The Jazz Butcher, Wetlands, NYC, September 23, 1999</b> <p /> C.A. Schneck <p />I got to see this show because of a vision I had. I know that sounds mad, but I can't think of a better word. During my lunch hour, one day in late August, I was walking to Chinatown in Boston, listening to the Jazz Butcher song \"Rosemary Davis World of Sound\" on my headphones. I suddenly had an image in my head of being in New York with my friend Jerry and Pat Fish (a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher). When I got back to work, I looked up the Jazz Butcher web site and saw that he was playing several shows in the US, including one in New York City. I told Jerry and he got us tickets for the show. <p /> I'm not going to attempt to give a full history of the Jazz Butcher; there's a wonderful web site (actually, it's pretty much the only worthwhile thing I've seen in my limited use of the Internet) at jazzbutcher.com. He's been around since the early eighties, but stopped playing as the Jazz Butcher a few years ago; currently he's not on a label and nearly all of his records are out of print. His music ranges from silly drinking songs to social commentary to gorgeous romantic guitar numbers - guess which ones are my favorites! He doesn't play in the US very often, and I really never expected to get to see him play. <p /> We got to the club around the time it was supposed to open, and of course it didn't open on time. I could hear the tantalizing sounds of the Jazz Butcher's sound check coming through the metal curtains covering the entrance; I recognized \"Mr. Odd.\" Wetlands, on Hudson Street, has the appearance of an abandoned warehouse, but Jerry had bought the tickets there so we knew we were in the right place. We positioned ourselves on the ramp near the entrance and amused ourselves people-watching and singing \"All Tomorrow's Parties.\" Quite a few cute people in the crowd. Eventually they opened the curtains and turned on the lights and made us line up and wait some more. As we were waiting, a tall, gaunt man in a suit came over the chains at the opposite side of the entrance and went into the club. Jerry said something about him looking like he was dead. <p /> Finally they started letting us in. The club was small but well laid out. To my right as I entered were the stairs to the bathrooms downstairs and a DJ booth made out of a wrecked van; to the left were steps up to the bar. Further back, the stage was against the right wall, with a dressing room area in the back right corner and seating along the left wall. Jerry and Sophie got places in the back left corner and then Jerry and I went to the bar. While he was buying drinks, I noticed the tall, gaunt man we had seen before. He was signing autographs. It was Max Eider, the guitarist. <p /> I couldn't sit still, so I found what I hoped was a good spot near the right-hand corner of the stage, and stood against a pillar drinking my beer. I happened to look over my right shoulder and saw Pat Fish. I felt my face light up in a big grin, and he smiled at me. At that point, I didn't care what the rest of the evening was like. <p /> There was a long wait before the opening band played. They had the unfortunate name Asseaters U.K. Their singer seemed drunk and embarrassed, but they didn't play very long. Someone said that the last song that they did was a Mekons song, but it wasn't one that I knew. Immediately after they left the stage, a red-haired woman in jeans and a short-haired guy in a red t-shirt began setting up effects boxes and other equipment. The club was quite full and I was glad that I had claimed my spot early. <p /> Finally, Max Eider and Pat Fish came onstage, to tremendous applause. Someone helped Max over to a stool, right in front of where I was standing. Pat was a little to the left. I had a great view, except that the stage lights weren't on. Pat said, \"I'm comfortable with my sexuality, could we have some light up here?\" He talked about how he just found out that Wetlands donates any profits they make to environmental causes, and said, \"What a good room to be in!\" They started the show with \"Partytime.\" As Pat sang, \"I could look at all the girls that are in this room,\" he looked around at all the girls in the front row. He was extremely attractive, although not conventionally handsome. Dark hair, dark eyes, great eyebrows, several teeth out - very British. He wore a dark blue suit over a grey cotton knit shirt with buttons at the neck, and soft-looking black leather shoes. Max was wearing a suit and black Doc Martens. Max was playing a hollow-bodied electric guitar, Pat a solid-bodied one with a sticker of a head of a cat wearing a rhinestone collar and winking its left eye. Several times during the first part of the set he made comments about them playing \"pussy music.\" He also told the audience \"Relax, we're going to be up here for hours,\" and referred to the show as the last Jazz Butcher show of the century (Wetlands billed it as the last ever.) After \"Partytime\" came \"Too Much Falling In Love,\" then Max Eider sang his song, \"Raking Up the Leaves.\" He seemed horribly nervous or something, but his singing and playing were gorgeous. <p /> They were then joined by Owen Jones, who with Pat and Max played on the earliest Jazz Butcher recordings, through 1986's <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>. He was dressed more casually than the others, wearing a striped knit shirt, and had sandy brown hair. Pat thanked someone at the club for lending them the accordion which Owen Jones was about to play, and said that theirs had gotten smashed by United Airlines - \"Boo United Airlines!\" He urged everyone to fly Delta. He then introduced \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish\" as a song about small gold fish. The previous weekend I had bought a pair of costume-jewelry earrings for fifty cents from an eccentric old lady at a yard sale; they were strings of gold-colored fish. I took them off the earrings and put them on safety pins, and thought that I would give one to Pat Fish if I got the chance to speak to him. As soon as I heard him say, \"Small gold fish,\" I took off one pin and tossed it onto the stage. He looked at it and left it lying there. Pat also told what he referred to as a joke and said that he was testing people's reactions to it - \"In Seattle there was dead silence.\" He said that when he was about eight, a kid came up to him on the playground and said, \"You know your dad?\" and he said yeah and the kid said, \"He drives with his brakes on.\" Later on in the set, he finished up a song by saying, \"He drives with his brakes on, ladies and gentlemen, the Jazz Butcher.\" <p /> After \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\" Pat switched to bass and handed his guitar to Owen Jones, who sang his song \"<span class='song'> <i>Don't Let Me Keep You</i> <span class=\"song_author\">(<span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/owen_jones.html\">Owen Jones</a> </span>)</span> </span>,\" which was very sad and lovely. Max then sang \"Who Loves You Now?\" Then Pat switched back to guitar and introduced Patrick Byrne, who he said had flown all the way from London that day to play with them. He was wearing a light-colored suit coat over a dark shirt, and had a rather peculiar haircut with shaved sides; we had noticed him outside the club before the show. He played kazoo and harmonica. Max sang \"D.R.I.N.K.,\" with kazoo accompaniment by Pat, Patrick and (I think) Owen. Pat then introduced Steven B. Ballantine, who joined them on bass. He was someone whose name I didn't recognize - he looked young and a little shy, and was wearing a suit, I think. Near the end of the set, Pat thanked him especially and said that he drove the van on the West Coast, played bass \"and is also the band's attorney.\" Following the drinking theme, they played \"Soul Happy Hour.\" On the recorded version, the introductory lyric is \"The best things in life are free/But you can give them to the S.D.P.\" (the Social Democratic Party). When they played the song, Pat sang, \"The best things in life are free/But you can give them to Spacemen 3.\" <p /> As I mentioned before, most of my favorite Jazz Butcher songs are the woozy, romantic ones from his later albums. Since they were all recorded with a different band, I didn't really expect him to play them, and he didn't. The one song I was really dying to hear was \"Angels,\" from <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>. (Regular readers of <U>Feedback</U> will recall my paean to \"Angels\" a few issues back.) After \"Soul Happy Hour,\" Pat sang a couple of lines from \"The Sandman,\" and then broke into \"Angels.\" I was ecstatic. Superlatives fail me. In the verse that begins, \"I can see them...\" he added the lines, \"They're up in heaven...I know because I've been there.\" Possibly the closest thing I've ever had to an orgasmic musical experience. Wow. <p /> Kevin Haskins joined the band on drums, wearing a black shirt, with black hair in a sort of quiff. Pat Fish picked up the string of fish I had thrown onstage earlier, held it up and said \"Thanks for the fish,\" then put it in the pocket of his suit coat. He introduced the next song as about being on \"the wrong side of the Carpathians\" - \"The Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula.\" Toward the end of the song, Pat's amp stopped working. The roadies came up on stage and started trying to fix it. People were yelling out song titles and suggestions. Someone said he should play through Max's amp and Pat said, \"You don't want me coming through there,\" and Max looked horrified and shook his head. Someone else said, \"Break up,\" and Pat said, \"We tried that.\" After the same person yelled about four song titles, Pat said, \"Honey, I'd be happy to be able to play you ANY FUCKING THING right now.\" He then announced that they would take a short break while \"the Cathy and Rob show\" tried to fix the amp, and then more or less ran off stage, very exasperated. <p /> Eventually, the roadies got the fuse changed in the amp, possibly the only time I've ever participated in an ovation for roadies. Incidentally, the crowd at the show was one of the most good-humored and positive crowds I've ever been in. Clearly everyone was there because they really wanted to be, and most of the audience seemed to know most of the songs. One person kept yelling, \"Stop mucking about!\" but I think they thought they were being funny. After the second or third time, Pat said, \"Go see a band that didn't break up four years ago.\" <p /> Pat came back onstage without his suit jacket and said something about having his coat off now. They played \"She's on Drugs\" and \"Mr. Odd,\" two of my favorites from 1990's <U>Cult of the Basement</U>. Pat then introduced \"Walk With the Devil\" as \"having been written during the Cold War, when writing about St. Petersburg was supposed to be ironic.\" They played \"President Reagan's Birthday Present\" and \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" Then Max played his song \"The Long Night Starts,\" which was quite lovely. Pat sang a verse of \"Purple Rain\" as the intro to \"Rain,\" a song that I'd never heard, yet which sounded oddly familiar. Next was \"Girlfriend,\" another favorite of mine - \"Well, it's funny cause I thought that it could have turned out quite romantic/But it isn't like that, which is fine, cause it means I can stand it.\" At some point in here, someone brought a beer up to the stage and tried to hand it to Pat. He had his back turned to the audience and Max Eider tapped him on the arm and said, \"Pat, someone's trying to give you a drink.\" Pat introduced \"Old Snakey,\" from 1995's <U>Illuminate</U>, as being from \"a record that never even got released over here,\" and referred to it as \"a newer old song.\" He made great snake movements with his hands while he was singing it. His moves were great - he danced and did great stuff with his feet while he played, and ended a couple of songs with Max standing up and Pat falling to his knees at the end of the song. It sounds clich&eacute; when I describe it, but it looked very spontaneous, natural and cool while they were doing it. \"Bigfoot Motel\" was next, followed by \"Zombie Love,\" which Pat introduced as being in \"the saddest of all keys, A minor.\" I found myself liking the goofier songs a lot more when I saw and heard them being played live. <p /> After \"Zombie Love,\" the band left the stage and returned, after much applause, to play a cover of Camper Van Beethoven's \"Take the Skinheads Bowling,\" which Pat dedicated to \"my close personal friend Curtis E. Johnson,\" in whose band, the Stranger Tractors, Pat Fish plays drums. They left the stage again, and returned again. Pat sang a verse I didn't recognize about \"a thing of beauty is a joy forever,\" and then said that the next song was about a particular section of highway outside Northampton, Pat's home. He then said, \"It's not what you think,\" and chanted the \"One-two-three-four-five-six!\" intro to the very special Jazz Butcher version of Jonathan Richman's \"Roadrunner\" with a section about \"Maximilian Eider did not know it, but he was entering the Twilight Zone/That's where he went/Said I wouldn't live next door to one if I were you...Rock and roll vegetable live next door to you/Rock and roll vegetable, vegetable stew/Roadrunner, roadrunner...\" <p /> This ended the show. I went over to Jerry and Sophie. Sophie immediately said, \"I loved him, he's so cute!\" which would have made her my friend for life, except that she already is. Jerry said that I looked so ecstatic that he thought my facial muscles were going to cramp up from smiling (they did get sore toward the end of the show, but it was a small price to pay.) Part of me wanted to stay and try to meet Pat Fish, and part of me was scared to, and Sophie wanted to go home, and so we left."},{"gigtext_id":351,"datetime":"1999-09-23 20:00:00","type":"review","credit":"Scott Deschaine","credit_date":null,"body":"Here's a feeble attempt to convey the thrill that was the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy show at the Wetlands in New York City on September 23, 1999. I hope it gives a small vicarious thrill to those who couldn't make it. And for those who could have come, but had some lame reason for not attending, I hope it makes you kick yourself..... <p /> The Wetlands itself is an open, clean, spacious yet informal club. This place donates all profits to environmental and political causes. There is an actual VW Bus coming out of one wall, complete with resident hippie girl passing out political literature for a variety of good and questionable causes. Ventilation of the club was great. The beer selection was good, if expensive, but hey, some of that money's going to protect the environment! Give me another, I'm saving the planet! <p /> Got there early, and got to meet Mr. Pat Fish! He's taller than expected (6' 2\"-4\"?). He courteously chatted with a variety of fans and admirers before the opening act. <p /> The crowd was mixed - young and old, male and female. Surprised at how many early twenty-somethings were there, and how many I talked with liked The Butcher's older stuff. How did they hear it?? One gent told me his first exposure to the Jazz Butcher's music was hearing \"Big Questions\" used as a theme song for a television show that reviewed music CDs! Anyone know the name of this show and other details? <p /> There was a short set by an opening band. <p /> Mr. Pat Fish and Mr. Max Eider took the stage. Pat said, \"Welcome to the last great rock concert of the century!\" And then they began gently playing what they called their \"pussy\" songs. \"Partytime\" was first. Over succeeding songs, Pat and Max were joined by Mr. Owen Jones, <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a> </span> (who Pat later thanked for, among other things, driving the van and being his attorney!), and another gent whose name I missed but who flew in from England just to play with the band that night. <p /> For those who care, to me the sound mix was fantastic, perfect. But to be honest, these guys could have been playing oatmeal boxes and kyotos and I'd have found no fault. <p /> Early in the show, the gents traded instruments around for different songs. On Owen's sad song \"<span class='song'> <i>Don't Let Me Keep You</i> <span class=\"song_author\">(<span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/owen_jones.html\">Owen Jones</a> </span>)</span> </span>,\" Pat played bass. Some of the other quieter songs included \"Raking Up the Leaves,\" \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\" and \"The Long Night Starts.\" <p /> And then they started getting wound up. Don't quote me on the exact order of the songs, but along came \"Falling in Love,\" \"She's On Drugs,\" \"Soul Happy Hour,\" \"D.R.I.N.K.\" <p /> You may have heard \"Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula\" before, but you never heard it like these guys played it that night. Roaring along, full of sound, all cylinders hitting, fun and scary at the same time! These guys mean it! Almost appropriately, Pat's guitar fritzed out at the end of the song. Even the equipment was not prepared for how this band was reaching critical mass! <p /> A quick break to fix the equipment. Good - a chance to squeeze through the crowd for one of those beers and help support the environment some more. Then the band was back on stage, ready to go again. <p /> Max Eider sat off to the right, in full concentration, looking up once in a while with a smile. Several times as the show heated up, he stood and walked around, seemingly moved by the music and quite enjoying himself. <p /> Owen Jones and <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a> </span> provided a driving, solid beat, adding OOMPH to songs that deserve it. Some live performances can't live up to recorded versions, but I've never heard some of these songs sound so rocking and full of life! <p /> And there's Pat Fish, center stage. Singing and playing guitar with control, then letting go with wild abandon, then pulling it all together again. Proudly showing off the talents of the gents around him. And delivering those great songs, one after another. Pat Fish, looking like a natural. <p /> The place was packed, hardly enough room to even move! As the show went on you could see ever increasing numbers of people begin to move with the music. At first, maybe only die-hard Butcher fans, but then more and more, until those standing still were a small number indeed! <p /> What's that? A rousing \"President Reagan's Birthday Present\" that segues into a pounding version of \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" OKAY! <p /> \"Rain\" - Alright! <p /> \"Walk With the Devil\" \"Girlfriend\" \"Mr. Odd\" \"Bigfoot Motel\" - THEY KEEP COMING! <p /> \"Forever\" (\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever...\") - sigh - too true! <p /> SIDE NOTE - Not many songs were played from some of the more recent JBC records and no SUMOSONIC tunes. From ILLUMINATE, only \"Old Snakey.\" This is a flat out horror story of a song - get that shocker ending!! On stage, this had a galloping, jerky quality quite different from the slithering riotousness of the album version. When introducing the song, Pat made some comment about Sony deciding not to release ILLUMINATE in the U.S. - talk about a horror story! What's the deal there? Anyone know why they chose not to release this monster of a disc?? <p /> \"Angels\" - HIT THE CEILING! Why that girl over there is actually crying! Who can blame her?? <p /> \"Zombie Love\" - YEAH GO! These guys are out of control! This song just COULDN'T sound so menacing and driving, but it does! <p /> First encore - \"Take the Skinheads Bowling.\" <p /> Second encore - \"Roadrunner.\" The whole place was bouncing. Even people who just sat along the back rail for the whole show jumped into the mass of dancing and shouting. <p /> I've never seen the Jazz Butcher before - never even thought I'd get the chance! My sincere thanks to all who helped make this tour possible. <p /> Not much comment on the list after this show and the end of the tour. Maybe too many mixed emotions. I look at that ticket stub and read \"The Last Show Ever!!!\" I don't know what will happen in the future, but I'm left with this memory -- <p /> One of the best bands in the world, fronted by one of the best songwriters in the world, at the top of their form, pounding out great song after great song in a crowded New York club full of Jazz Butcher fans on a cool night in early fall. <p /> The last great rock concert of the century. <p /> What's next?"},{"gigtext_id":352,"datetime":"1999-09-23 20:00:00","type":"review","credit":"Wilson Neate","credit_url":"http://www.thei.aust.com/tssmusic1/jazzbutcher.html","credit_date":null,"body":"<img src=\"https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/images/19990923/23Sep1999_NeateBanner.gif\" alt=\"XXX\" border=0> <h2>The Jazz Butcher, Wetlands, New York City.

The total Value-For-Money experience of the Jazz Butcher live, coupled with a decade's worth of consistently fine recordings, make you wonder how on earth it is that Pat Fish still remains a marginal entity, his status bordering on that most horrible of all rock cliches: the well kept secret, the, ahem, cult figure.<p /> But never mind, I come to praise The Jazz Butcher not to bury him/them. Besides, as Mr Fish himself pointed out last night, this band has been around the block more than a few times already and actually split up four years ago anyway; and given the reception that they got from a packed house of Jazz Butcher Conspirators of all stripes, I suspect that they'll be back sometime next century. Indeed, The Jazz Butcher draws a very eclectic, boy/girl crowd these days: suits and ties straight from their law offices, younger indie enthusiasts who missed out on the 80s but who have a sense of history and taste, and, of course, heavy drinkers of all persuasions, shapes and hairstyles came together to sing along to two hours of the greatest hits.<p /> Whether or not it was the last show ever, it was certainly the last show on their current North American tour, for which Fish has reenlisted his very able former cohorts: ex-Bauhaus and Love and Rockets drummer Kevin Haskins, multi-instrumentalist Owen Jones and, of course, guitar maestro Max Eider.<p /> Things got off to an unexpected start as this reviewer was granted his completely pathetic 15, er, seconds of fame when the Butcher opened the proceedings by introducing him to the crowd as England football celebrity and husband of Posh Spice, David Beckham. The moral of this very short story is, if you've got blond hair and are wearing a Manchester United football jersey, do not stand too close to the stage when someone with wits as sharp as the Butcher's is on the prowl. It being an American audience, though, I don't think that anyone really got the joke - I mean, people actually applauded and I even gave a polite, yet awkward, wave of recognition to play along.<p /> But enough about me, Pat Fish and Max Eider set the festive tone for the evening, kicking things off as a duo with, not surprisingly, <i>Partytime</i> from 1983's <i>Bath of Bacon.</i> What followed was a two-hour-plus set with (and occasionally without) the rest of the band mapping out the finest moments in the JB catalogue, except <i>Southern Mark Smith</i> curiously enough, despite the relentless shouting of requests for it. But then we got to hear pretty much everything else.<p /> Nevertheless, the set was truncated by a 20 minute intermission when Fish's guitar amp chose a particularly inappropriate time to call it a day. Consequently, the band retreated from the stage to regroup, the Butcher himself visibly frustrated and uncharacteristically flustered; still, it was a special occasion, "},{"gigtext_id":354,"datetime":"2000-04-13","type":"review","credit":"Al Avery","credit_url":"avery@mediaone.net","credit_date":null,"body":"Just returned from the show at TT's. It was excellent to see Pat, Max, Owen and Steve again and they played beautifully. The turnout was good, and vocal -but not in a bad way as has been experienced by some on the list out west. Everyone was very excited to see the JBC live, myself included. The set was similar to what was played in NYC last September with the addition of a couple of new songs slated for the new CD due in the states around the end of the summer according to Pat. The song \"Morphine\" sounded particularly good. <p/> Those of you that are able to attend this tour -enjoy the shows! It's a real treat! And I'll \"LEAVE IT!\" at that. </p>"},{"gigtext_id":355,"datetime":"2000-04-13","type":"review","credit":"Amanda Izenstark","credit_url":"aizenstark@mindspring.com","credit_date":null,"body":"I have to second Al's comments. The show was wonderful, and the new tunes sounded great! Max's cd was on sale at the show, and it was nice to hear \"Rosemary\" live. The crowd was nearly silent between songs -- \"It's undivided attention,\" I remarked to one of the people I was with. Everyone played well, and I'm certain they would have gone on beyond the single encore if TT's wasn't about to close."},{"gigtext_id":356,"datetime":"2000-04-13","type":"review","credit":"VerveNet@...","credit_date":null,"body":"No, I never did give away those two extra tickets from yesterday, which is a shame because I could have doubled the size of the audience that made it to TT's for Pat's first appearance here in 8 years. In the mementos department I now have two snagged set lists in my collection - the first from 1992's show at nearby Nightstage, and the second from this evening's somewhat more intimate performance at TT's. (And I could have had three, maybe, had I not driven past the Paradise club one night circa 1987, reading the marquee and musing, \"hm, who ARE those guys?\") The most charming thing about these pieces of paper is the identical handwriting, i.e. Pat's very distinctive penmanship (does this count as an autograph?), though in tonight's case he neglected to make a little heart symbol out of the \"o\" in \"Who Loves You Now?\" as was the case with 92's \"Falling in Love.\" For kicks I've attached a copy, which will help to spare you any detailed play-by-play of which songs were played or neglected. Suffice to say I was happy enough to hear a somewhat runny version of my all time favorite, \"Soul Happy Hour,\" which rendered all else, in my humble opinion, anticlimactic. Still the Fish/Eider/Jones combo rendered even my lesser-liked numbers like \"She's a Yo Yo\" and \"She's On Drugs\" enjoyable - tight and LOUD at exactly the right moments, the former concluding with a neat \"Clash City Rockers\" chant that was slyly in tune with Pat's insistence (five separate references) at reminding the crowd of how damn old we all were. \"Thanks for coming out to support this sad old group,\" he said at one point. Meanwhile, all the old disks earned their token song or two, with the shameful neglect of \"Big Planet...\" which remains, if you ask me, the most underrated Fish disk of them all. A encore of \"The Good Ones,\" maybe his prettiest song ever, could have been a nice touch."},{"gigtext_id":357,"datetime":"2000-04-13","type":"review","credit":"Christopher Post","credit_url":"chrispost@surfree.com","credit_date":null,"body":"Great show. It's rare for a song to grab me by the throat, I tend to need songs to sink in before suddenly it dawns on me how damn good they are - but the first new song played last night, \"Diamorphine\", was absolutely great. Wonderful, innovative guitar playing from both Pat and Max - lots of wahwah, backed up by a searing melodic line. Pat said after the show that the new album will be out in a couple of months - I can't remember what it'll be called, though a final title was announced at the show - but if these two songs are anything to go by, it's going to be a beaut."},{"gigtext_id":358,"datetime":"2000-04-13","type":"review","credit":"Carol A. Schneck","credit_url":"CSchneck@capitalcrossing.com","credit_date":null,"body":"<h2>The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy </h2> <b>Live at TT the Bear's, Cambridge, MA, April 13, 2000</b> <p/> This review's a bit feeble, I know - if it's any excuse, I spent the day after the show in bed with a migraine and just got up today, so it's not as fresh as it could have been. I spent a lot of time looking at my notes and saying, \"What?\" </p> <p/> I'm moving back to Lansing, Michigan next month, so this was probably the last concert I'll see for a while - and what a great concert it was! This was the first time I'd ever been to TT the Bear's. It had a much nicer vibe than the Middle East - friendlier employees and a nicer layout. There's a wide entry hall between the two sides of the club. At the rear of the hall are the bathrooms. Off the left side of the hall is the bar, with seating at the far side of it and a small room with a pool table to the left of the bathrooms. Off the right side of the hall is the stage area, with the stage at the front and the sound booth at the back. </p> <p/> I had thought about going to the show late, since there were three opening bands, but I got too antsy and ended up getting there a little before nine. I was glad I did, because when I arrived, the club was nearly empty, and Pat and Kathie were just standing around at the merchandise table. I got to talk to them a bit and got Pat to sign my Condition Blue CD insert. Pat said, \"I like people who bring their own Sharpies.\" (I always carry a Sharpie - you never know when you're going to need to graffiti something.) Pat said something about not being sure what they were going to play, as it was the first show of the tour. I lobbied unsuccessfully for \"Racheland.\" Forgot to mention that on April 13, 1796, the first elephant arrived in America. </p> <p/> The first band, Device, introduced themselves as being \"English, like the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy,\" and kept talking about how their music was drum and bass, \"so we'd all be able to recognize it when it came over here.\" Okay. One of the guitarists looked like a young Mark E. Smith. The second band, the Shelley Winters Project, had a violinist, a guitarist who was too cute and knew it, and a keyboard player/vocalist who introduced the band by saying \"We're not Devo.\" It's true, they aren't Devo, although the singer had that Church of the Subgenius vibe. They were reasonably amusing. At this point a guy came up to me and asked me if I was a writer. He was from Your Sound, a web site which was supposedly \"sponsoring\" the show. I don't know what that consisted of, other than having a rather ugly banner hanging on the back wall of the stage. Then he wanted to know if I wanted to write for their web site. I accepted a business card and he went away. </p> <p/> And then it was AEUK time! (This now seems to be the \"official\" name of the band - or at least they introduced themselves as AEUK, not Ass Eaters UK.) They've got a new singer, who can actually sing - she had kind of a platinum-haired Barbie doll New York look. I thought they were better than they were at last fall's Wetlands show, although they drove most of the audience into the bar. They did a cover of \"Tie Your Mother Down\" by Queen, so I'll give them points for that. <p/> Earlier in the evening, Pat and Max had carried a couple of the barstools across to the side of the stage, and Pat now brought them onstage. Owen started setting up his drums, Pat and Kathie were unsnarling guitar cords, Max was positioning his effects box. Then everyone went off and Pat and Max reappeared, wearing sunglasses - Max's were reddish-brown and oval, Pat's were retro-shaped and silvery. When I saw them in NYC last year, Max was at the extreme right of the stage and Pat was at the center, in front of the drums. This time their positions were reversed, with Pat at the extreme right of the stage. They seated themselves, and after a bit of a struggle with the reverb on Pat's amp - he said something about sounding like Chrissie Hynde - they played \"Partytime.\" </p> <p/> Here's a phenomenon I don't understand: when Pat and Max were walking around the club together, Max seemed shorter than Pat, but when they're both onstage together, Max is taller. Can anyone explain this? Both Pat and Max wore dark suits, Max with a black polo-neck shirt and Doc Martens, Pat with a white knit collarless button-neck shirt and black boots. Pat was playing a black Fender with a Schwa alien head and a Sumo sticker. After \"Partytime,\" Owen joined them, wearing black jeans and t-shirt, and seated himself. Pat then pulled out some drink tickets and asked if anyone in the audience would go and get them a couple of beers. A guy near the right-hand side of the stage was dispatched for three Rolling Rocks, and Pat then said, \"That's the last we'll see of him.\" However, he reappeared, beers in hand, during the next tune, \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\" with Owen on accordion. (Later someone kept bringing Pat bottles of Bass ale.) Pat said something about getting slower as you get older. Kathie came up and sat at the drum kit to provide backing vocals and percussion for the next couple of songs. They played Max's song, \"Baby It's You,\" which he referred to as \"being called 'Baby, Baby, Baby' or something like that.\" </p> <p/> Pat removed his shades and switched to bass. There was a persistent buzzing from one of the amps at the left-hand side of the stage, and he said, \"Love that buzz!\" One of the audience members responded, \"Waiting for the Love Buzz!\" to which Pat sternly replied, \"That's as bad as one of mine.\" Owen played guitar and sang his lovely, sad song \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\" Then Kathie left the stage, Owen moved to the drums and Pat took up the guitar, saying, \"It's like progressive rock, all this instrument swapping.\" He then introduced \"DRINK,\" with Max on vocals, by saying, \"It's cabaret time.\" Afterward he said, \"You should see us down the library.\" <p/> Steve Valentine then joined the band on bass, standing at the left-hand side of the stage. Max sang, \"Who Loves You Now?\" Next was \"Girlfriend,\" a favorite of mine, with some very fierce guitar at the end and Pat shaking his hair about. He introduced \"Mr. Odd\" by saying, \"This next number's not necessarily one you'd associate with this collection of individuals...\" Max stood up to play \"Mr. Odd,\" which was followed by \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" Pat then paused to tune his guitar, saying something about sounding like Spacemen 3, and then began \"Soul Happy Hour\" by singing, \"The best things in life are free, but you can give them to Spacemen 3.\" </p> <p/> Max then sang a new song, a fast rocking number called \"Rose Marie.\" Pat introduced the next song as being set in New Orleans on a 48-hour drinking binge, \"where I met a lovely girl that became my girlfriend.\" The song was \"Sweet Water,\" off of Waiting for the Love Bus, a delicious surprise. \"She's On Drugs\" was next, followed by a new song which Max sang, \"Diamorphine.\" Max commented, \"Old age is not for sissies,\" before he started the song, which was one of the highlights of the show. My notes say, \"Pat heavy distorted guitar YES!\" I think I cried a little, and I know the big goofy grin showed up on my ace around here. Pat mentioned that their new LP was to be called Rotten Soul, and sang another new song, \"Niagara,\" which was also excellent. Afterward Pat said, \"We should be pretty good at that round about Iowa,\" at which the guy behind me announced that he was from Iowa City. Pat then asked for a show of hands from anyone who was NOT from Iowa City. He then used, \"Be very careful while traveling through the Midwest...\" as the introduction to \"Bigfoot Motel.\" </p> <p/> They didn't play \"Racheland,\" but Pat introduced the next one as \"a song about just how shitty things can get around the home,\" and they played \"She's a Yo-Yo\" from Condition Blue. This was an excellent ending to an excellent set. The band left the stage and the house lights came up, but they returned for a very fast encore of \"Take The Skinheads Bowling.\" (Earlier Pat had commented on seeing the time in big glowing orange numbers on the clock across from the stage.) Closing times in Cambridge are very early. I can't wait for the new album. </p>"},{"gigtext_id":359,"datetime":"2000-04-15","type":"review","credit":"Jim Gibbin","credit_url":"jhg@mail.buffnet.net","credit_date":null,"body":"Well the JBC 2000 has now officialy played in Buffalo, cosmopolitan hub of American urban degredation.

I won't bother with a long review, as it's all pretty much been said about the other shows so far, but it was great. I think I preferred seeing them in the MIT over a club like Laga. The small room created a much more intimate atmosphere, and was plenty of space for everyone that came. Sound quality was good, the only low point being \"She's a Yo-Yo\", when the vocals were so low in the mix that they couldn't really be heard. I didn't get the set list, but I think it was about the same as has been posted so far. They played for about an hour and twenty minutes total, not counting the breaks between encores. <p/> Anyway, I wanted to throw in my comments on the merchandise. There were, of course, the CDs. I picked up Max's album, I'd forgotten how good it is (it's been a long time since I've listened to my vinyl copy). The shirts I found to be rather disappointing. There were three t-shirt designs . . . One that just had \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" written in sort of a hexagon thing (this was also available in a \"baseball\" shirt with red sleeves). Really boring. One with a photo of the band from 1984 and the caption \"I thought it had stopped -- JBC 1984\". This was the best of them, so I picked it up, though I would have much preferred one that actually said \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" on it. Then there was one with the Glorious and Idiotic logo on it, but for some reason it also had AEUK plastered all over it. If it weren't for that, I would probably have bought this one, but since I didn't really care for AEUK, it was out. None of the t-shirts seemed particularly well printed. Then there were the polo shirts, but I've never been particularly into polo shirts, and the concept of one with a band logo on it just seems really odd to me, so I didn't really look at them. It's a shame the shirts weren't better done -- I would have been more than happy to pay more for a better printed one with a better design on it. Oh well. </p>"},{"gigtext_id":361,"datetime":"2000-04-18","type":"review","credit":"Dave Ungar","credit_url":"dave.ungar@hotbot.com","credit_date":null,"body":"So let's get right to it - <p/> Opening Band #1: Bath. Have you heard Nico's Camera Obscura record? I doubt they have either, but for awhile there they sounded kind of good. It went on a bit long. Fellow list memeber Tom Zimmer said it best, \"They have crossed the line from entertainment into self-indulgence.\" \"Always leave them wanting more\" as they say .... </p> <p/> ...Which would not have been possible for A.E.U.K., who assaulted the crowd with mediocrity. Now, they were not a loud, heavy metalish thing as I was led to believe by previous reviews. They were a run-of-the-mill bar band - sounding a bit like Pat Benetar, Plasmatics, etc... I fuckin' wish! Even at the end of their set, when the tight-pantsed singer said, \"good night Cleveland! You guys rock!\" - it was flat. Not much enthusiasm coming off the stage. I'm falling asleep just thinking about them. </p> <p/> A mercifully short 25 minute set by A.E.U.K. was followed-up by a wonderful-as-always set by the JBC. The room was swaying like a boat - because it *is* a boat. And that's a fact. (So went the lyrics in the <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/human_jungle.html\">The Human Jungle</a></i> </span> - the Phantasy Nite Club has these big friggin' (in the riggin') BOATS in it. Not canoes like at kitchy chain resturants - BOATS.

Infectious even. Available on the limited edition CD given to the Guestpass 2000 crowd. I'll be singing it all day. </p> <p/> The other three tracks on the CD: <br/> 1.a JBC/Sumo number<br/> 2.a new Max Eider original<br/> 3.a song about Pat's Cat </p> <p/> We'll see what we can do about posting some lo-fi, mono excerpts. </p> <p/> The review of the Boston show can probably take over from here - sounds as if the two shows were similar.

Great show. <p/> We agreed Dave got to review the show. I got the bassist's set list (thanks to Kathie) and get to do the fashion review. </p> <p/> I'd say there were between 45 and 60 people there. One group being members and/or hangers on of the opening act band members dressed akin to Thomas Dolby, hangers on in full Gothic regalia, and all way too young to be out that late. </p> <p/> Second group, also young, dressed in full Seattle grunge outfits. Fashion trends tend to hit Cleveland late I guess. </p> <p/> Third group, and the largest, 30 and 40 + regular folks. </p> <p/> BTW, AEUK stands for \"anything you want it to\", according to the singer. If anyone has the nerve, ask her what keeps her pants from falling down. </p> <p/> Oh, and JBC were, well, I don't think it could have been much better. Good sound, good tunes, hard to remember anything to complain about (other than getting home at 4am from Cleveburg). The new tunes blend seemlessly with the old IMHO.

As the night moved forward, the crowd dwindled down to 30 to 40 MAX once the black-suited members (very 80's guys!) took the stage and set-up their own gear (kinda makes them human, huh?) PLEASE: If someone reads this before departing to an upcoming show, please make Max a sandwich! That boy needs some muscle on his frame! <p/> Anyway, the show was mediocre - but this was not the band's fault. The sound was horrible - way too loud for this type of music and way too bassy. The crowd's size took all the wind out of the Phantasy's sails, the band, and the atmosphere - you could almost \"hear\" the guys looking at their watches if you had really good ears (?). The show seemed rushed, lacking emotion, and honestly, I don't blame them. When I last saw them in New York in September, there was something vital about the whole affair, and the crowd and vibe that went along with it made it a smoking show! This could not be said for Cleveland. I was very disappointed, and I feel the band felt that way too. A kind of \"Why bother running on all 6 cylinders mate!\" kinda thing. </p> <p/> Pat played very well, and at times was full of manic energy. Max was the best he could be at 100 lbs. fighting weight. However, our relatively new bassist needs some more lessons! His playing was very weak and I couldn't help feeling through the whole show that he just learned the songs that afternoon! Nothing personal, but his playing felt as if it were \"lacking\" something - that something being a style. </p> <p/> The 50/50 cotton blend items were totally garbage, although it was very nice to be able to pick up Max's CD without putting out much yen. </p> <p/> Ooops, look at the time!

They were here last night and they were great. I'm so glad I was able to see them live. I didn't get home until 2:30 so I'm paying for it today, but they're worth it. The club was nice. I had never been there before. It's upstairs from a bowling alley. It's pretty small, and it's half pool hall and half alternative-rock club. There's a good size dance floor, and there are tables behind the dance floor, and on platforms on either side. We sat at a table near the front of one platform. At one point during the first band, Pat Fish and Max Eider sat down in front of us on the platform itself (not in chairs). <p/> I probably won't get the song titles right, but here goes. They started out with just Pat and Max doing It's Party Time and Girls Who Keep Goldfish. Then they were joined on stage by an accordion player whose last name was Jones (didn't catch his first name) who later turned out to be the drummer. They did a couple songs like that, then Jones played guitar and sang one song that was beautiful... it might be called I Won't Keep You or something like that. Then the bass player came out and the whole band was in place. </p> <p/> They played for about an hour and a half. Their songs are so great!! There was a cool song that mentioned Michael Jackson, but unfortunately I don't remember any of the other lyrics. There was another song that had the word girlfriend in the chorus a lot, and that was another really good one. Some others that I remember are Niagara, Sex and Travel, Sweetwater, Mr. Odd, Girl-Go. They did a couple songs that Pat said were new, and I think the names were Daughter Morphine and Come On Marie. Come On Marie sounded Motown-ish, and Pat said he was excited about playing it in Detroit. He mentioned several times that he likes Detroit a lot. He was really funny between songs. At one point they were having equipment problems and Pat left the stage & returned with a notebook which must have been his tour journal. He told us how many eggs the band has eaten during the tour & stuff like that. Despite the equipment problems, they looked like they were having a lot of fun. There weren't a whole lot of people there, but those who were there really liked the band, were yelling out song titles, etc. </p> <p/> Most people stood in front of the stage. We could see good from our table, and I'm beyond the point where I can stand for a whole set anyway. Pat came back for an encore, which was A Thing of Beauty, then the rest of the guys came back on and they played Take the Skinheads Bowling. Then they left the stage, and people were still making a lot of noise, so they came back for another encore. I don't know what it was, but it was excellent. My friend Karen liked them a lot, and wants to get some of their CD's (if she can find them). </p> <p/> The art gallery show was fun too. They only had 3 of Pat's drawings up, but they were cool. One of them had a set list on it. The Buffalo book stuff is great. </p>"},{"gigtext_id":366,"datetime":"2000-04-20","type":"review","credit":"David Zembower","credit_url":"zembower@interaccess.com","credit_date":null,"body":"It is Friday morning, 08:43, and I am working on 2.5 hours sleep following last night's Butcher show at wonderful Shuba's in Chicago. This was the first show I have attended at Shuba's, and it was a real treat to see Pat and the boys in such a small, intimate venue. <p/> I arrived at 10:00, about one hour after the show started. I was pleased to see the sign on the door \"Tonight's Show Sold Out\". At Shuba's that meant a crowd of approximately 250-300. <p/> Arriving late, I missed AEUK (thanks to Doc, who informed me I was lucky to have missed it. It was great to meet another list member in the flesh). At about 10:15 the next act came on, Mezodigm. They were what you would expect from an opening band. Not the best I've seen, not the worst I've seen, but an opening band. They sounded like a cross between Syd Barrett and Catherine Wheel, a wall of noise with meaningless lyricks. The best part was when an audience member yelled \"What does Mezodigm mean?\", to which the singer merely scowled. After the set, I had a chance to ask the same question to the bass player while in line for the \"facilities\", and he chuckled and said \"I get in trouble when I tell people it means 'a half-assed paradigm'\". That was a better reply than the singer's. <p/> Finally, at about 11:30, Pat and Max hit the stage, both wearing black, and both donning their sunglasses. They launched into Partytime and, unlike the San Francisco show, rapidly escalated into faster and louder songs, with the entire band on stage by the fourth or fifth song. When Pat introduced Steve Valentine, he referred to him as \"Son of Chicago, Attorney at Law and Bad-Ass-Mother-F*cker\". I did not record the set list, but it was basically identical to the lists posted for other shows on the tour. The sound was very good, not excellent like in San Francisco. Also, the mix of songs tended to focus, especially as the show headed into the early morning hours, on the faster rockers (She's a Yo-Yo comes to mind). The three songs from their forthcoming album were fantastic. Normally I'm bored stiff when a band plays songs I have not heard before, but these already sounded like old friends. <p/> The T-shirts looked cheap, like they would fit a GI Joe action figure if laundered. One style featured a 1984 photo of Pat, Max and Owen from the cover of (I think, I don't have it so I'm going on memory) The Gift of Music. The other style featured a heptagon (that's a seven-sided figure, for the geometrically challenged) with the letters JBC in the center. I passed on those, but did pick up a Max Eider CD for $15. It seemed like a lot of people were scooping up Max CDs and G&I CDs. <p/> At the end of the regular set the band stood off to the side of the stage for about 30 seconds before returning for their first encore. Pat and Max were having a good chuckle over this, because the side of the stage was in plain view to everyone, and it was quite obvious they weren't going anywhere. They played two encores, both short (two or so songs, I cannot remember exactly). The crowd really glommed onto Take the Skinheads Bowling. <p/> All in all, an excellent evening. The audience was very deep into the music. Even during the \"quieter\" songs, the crowd was intensely listening, with very little conversation noise. The whole band seemed to really appreciate the reception. <p/> Additional treat. Pat and Max will be playing an intimate \"semi-acoustic\" set at a club called Danny's tonight.

It's an old two-flat building (meaning there's two apartments, one on top of the other). The main bar is in the front room, off the main entrance. There are little rooms on the main and second floors. The bar is in an area the size of an average living room. The next room is the main lounge, and it's roughly the same size as the bar. The band played in that room. It was Pat, Max, and Mister Jones (Steve Valentine was in attendance but didn't play). <p/> Why were JBC playing there? Mostly because the owner of the bar is a huge JBC fan. Last year when the the JBC played the Wetlands, the owner of the bar flew to New York, saw the show, met the band, and made the offer that if they came through Chicago at anytime on any future tour, leave an extra day open in Chicago. They could play there anytime they liked and he would pay for everything. <p/> As a result, we got to see the JBC for free. Well, there was a lot of drinking going on... so it wasn't exactly free. <p/> Much to my doom, I met a brewer from the local Goose Island Brewery. Needless to say, once he found another fellow JBC fan, the beer flowed freely.

There were some UGA students there, but they were there to see Death Cab for Cutie who opened the show. The audience had shrunk by the time AEUK came on, and no one, including me, could really make out what they were on about, but they were gone in a flash. Pat and Max were in a good mood and Pat thanked the audience continually. He was making jokes about the small crowd, when Steve joined them he threatened \"soon we will outnumber you!\" Pat broke a string very early on, not sure what song it was. Unlike how the Cleveland show was apparently, they didn't play halfheartedly and it was a wonderful introduction for me to JBC live. <p/> Afterwards as Owen and Steve were packing up I had them sign a flier I'd pulled off the wall. Steve told me to go around backstage to get Pat and Max to sign it. When I walked into the room, Pat pointed at me saying, \"I think I know who you are!\" It turns out he'd read my \"Glorious and Idiotic\" review in the Flagpole free weekly (www.flagpole.com) and had noticed my name when I signed up for their mailing list. (I should mention that I didn't recognize Pat who was standing right in front of me, shows what a newbie I am!) I was beyond flattered that he'd remembered it and me and liked what I had to say. He signed the flier, \"thanks mate, you did your best!\" Apparently not a lot of people were really excited by my praise for the album! Still, even though I felt bad for them playing to such a small group, it did make the gig a bit friendlier and relaxed. I took a bunch of pictures not all of which look great because I mainly had to use a flash which killed all of the lighting. Hope you like them! The scans there are pretty small and I can give you larger versions if you want.

I was catatonically drunk, but I remember that their set was as satisfying as the turn-out was depressing. Future hot-shit indie-frauds Death Cab for Cutie opened the show, and there were maybe fifteen people there specifically to see them. It was a complete bath for the club, Im sure, as the audience never numbered more than 25, and at least ten of those I know to have gotten in for free. So Death Cabs fifteen fans, who were all either seventeen years old or named Amber Townsend, left as soon as they finished. Death Cab also decided to leave as quickly as possible, trying to duck out before the Jazz Butcher even took the stage. When the club understandably gave Death Cab less money than they expected, members of the band apparently pitched a (no doubt very sensitive) hissy fit. Im not sure what was said, or if there was any physical contact, but whatever happened led to Death Cab being banned from the 40 Watt for almost four years. A year later Ben Gibbard briefly recounted the affair in that horrible Devil in the Woods magazine, and seemed to feel legitimately ashamed about his actions. I didnt witness the altercation, but throughout their performance, and up until the point when they left (attracting as much attention as they could from a crowd of ten), they were visibly pissed about the turn-out, and looked like theyd rather be anywhere else. This was in early 2000, right after their second album had been released, and well before they attained any notable national fame. They didnt have any reason to expect a good turn-out, and their actions made them look like presumptuous assholes. <p/> The Jazz Butcher, meanwhile, who had much more of a right to be upset, having come all the way from England, took everything in stride. Instead of complaining or moping he addressed the situation the only way men should, with humor and alcohol. He and the Conspiracy (or whatever they were calling themselves then) put on a good, highly entertaining show, and the few of us who gave a shit about them had a damn good time. If the guys in Death Cab had stayed they would have learned something about professionalism, and/or how not to be pathetic dicks. <p/> I got hooked on the Jazz Butcher when I was twelve, thanks to Rich Halls old Onion World program on the original Comedy Channel. Hall had lots of good bands on that program - del Amitri, the Trashcan Sinatras, Big Dipper - but the Jazz Butcher was the most prominent, and the best. Partytime and Southern Mark Smith are two of my favorite songs by the Butcher. I used to listen to them on a tape I made by hooking our television up through the stereo. These songs come from my old vinyl copy of the Bloody Nonsense compilation, which I believe is currently out of print. They sound a lot better when the Sniglet guy isnt talking over them, thats for sure. But so there are a lot of Jazz Butcher compilations out there, and for the most part you'll probably want to stick with his early '80's stuff."},{"gigtext_id":379,"datetime":"2000-05-07","type":"review","credit":"John Spence & Diane White","credit_url":"ocbh@juno.com","credit_date":null,"body":"Please excuse the ramblings of a couple of very tired yet exicted fans. <p/> My mother and I, who have been listening to the band since the early 80's, consider ourselves quitre lucky to have attended both shows, Philly & VA, near our home in Ocean City, Maryland. It was certainly everything we expected and more, and worth every minute behind the wheel. Anyone who has a chance to see the NYC show should do themselves a favor, compel all their friends to attend, and allow one of the most down to earth bands to give you a night of high quality entertainment. <p/> The show in Philadelphia started around 9:00 or so with a local band, The Trouble with Sweeney. They helped draw some locals to the venue and fill a large dance floor/club. As I was downstairs in the restaurant talking with Pat and Max, I didn't get to see but one or two songs of theirs. I think if I wasn't there to see JBC, I may have enjoyed them. For those who are looking for a place to do some pre-show drinking, I advise you to go to the venue itself. At the risk of being put in the band's doghouse, I will tell you that they made themselves available for conversation & cocktails at the bar. I know they must have been a little uncomfortable with the attention, not to mention that they were in a steakhouse. <p/> I felt like a kid at Christmas, to be able to talk with the fellows before the show. They were having a pint with a few friends from the US, but took the time to answer a few questions I had about the history of the band, how the tour was organized, their songwriting techniques, and overall impression of the US and its fans. It's so refreshing to meet musicians who are unpretentious, polite, and accessable. If other bands I've seen acted the same way, I'm sure they would have a more devoted following. <p/> As I headed upstairs to set up the minidisc player (Yes, I tried to tape both shows, I'll get those interested more info later - Thank you, DJ the sound man.), I stopped at the concession booth. Kathie, a woman of multi-talents, was very patient in answering a few more questions I forgot to ask downstairs. She sang backup vocals on Max's new song, \"Baby , It's You.\" & Owen's tune \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\" When she's not doing this, she also restrings the guitars (Pat was playing with a religious fervor), drives the band around, and helps to keep them in line and make sure things run smoothly. <p/> The four song set by AEUK was not what you'd expect at a JBC show. If any of you have listened to the Black Eg album, you'd have a pretty good idea what they're like. Since the drummer and bassist left the tour in Chicago, they were accompanied by the Barrister of Bass, who was making a statement on global warming by performing in a Baklava. He must be quite passionate about the subject, as I almost passed out in a sportshirt and shorts. Although most of the other reviews stated that the AEUK members were inaccessable, I found the exact opposite. I talked at great length to Chris and Scott (thanks for the T's) and they actually helped organize the tour. They booked the clubs, helped with the driving, setting up instruments, etc. Diehard JBC fans, and a pair of very nice guys. Sorry, I never asked what the acronym means. <p/> At about 10:30 the JBC took to the stage. I'll get the set list out of the way, and I've included some of the background info the band provided: <p/> <table border=0> <tr><td valign=top> Partytime</td><td valign=top> Pat & Max </td></tr> <tr><td valign=top> What's The Matter, Boy?</td><td valign=top> Dedicated to the man with the Box on his head </td></tr> <tr><td valign=top> Baby, It's You.</td><td valign=top> Pat, Max, Owen (Accordian & Foot Tambourine), & Kathie (Vocals) - This is a perfect example of how to write a song using the same words over & over, just put the word \"Baby\" in it, even if it's a little weird to call your girlfriend, \"baby.\" </td></tr> <tr><td valign=top> Don't Let Me Keep You</td><td valign=top> Pat (Bass), Max, Owen (Guitar & Lead Vocal) & Kathie (B Vocal) - Owen's got a great voice, he should sing more.

Throughout the show, we were treated to witticisms from the Butcher and Max, it seemed like they were having as much fun as we were. Before the first encore, Pat said, \"We don't have a backstage, so we could hide in the bathroom, or play some more.\" The crowd made the right decision. I wish more of the fans had danced, I think of it as a way to show my appreciation of the music the band was putting their hearts and soul into. There was very limited seating, so we were all on our feet anyway. Overall though the fans were great too. After the show, Pat and Max hung out, and talked to the fans, but we couldn't stick around as we were driving to VA for the next show. Review to follow. <p/> Anyone who can make the last few shows should go at all costs.

At an objective and sober distance it still strikes me that this was a helluva gig. What I thought was particularly striking was the difference between this and the Boston show; that was good, but sometimes a little hesitant (Bigfoot Motel, She's on Drugs, Mr Odd in particular didn't sound totally \"natural\") but here, after nearly a month on the road, everyone was so clearly more familiar and flowing with each song. I really enjoyed the way certain songs had gained new verses or instrumental passages, Bigfoot sounded like the \"original\" Hamburg version - i.e. maniacally energetic - I thought Owen sang really strongly on his Don't Let Me Keep You, and Mr Odd and She's on Drugs were awesome here. Diamorphine is a great song from the new album (no wah-wah this time, when did that drop out?) , Niagara sounded a lot stronger this time around, the sound was very good (I swear this was one of the loudest gigs I've ever been to, but then again I was standing 3 feet from the main LH speaker) and everyone had a great time.

Unfortunately for him, David was not able to attend on Saturday night, so having left my very understanding spouse in China, I went it alone. Being my first time in Tokyo (discounting a prior one night airport layover), it was an interesting experience... <p/> After taking the train from Narita airport to Shinjuku and registering at the hotel David had recommended and some preliminary running about, I armed myself with three maps in various languages and scales and commenced the 15 minute trek in the general direction of the club, finding it with only minimal difficulty. <p/> The club is located in an area that could euphemistically be described as... catering to those in need of some stress relief. But please be assured it was very well-lit, well-peopled, fairly clean and without any threatening types roaming about. <p/> The venue is called Shinjuku Loft, and being named such, you might expect it to be on a building's upper level. Good guess, however it is actually level -2, the lowest basement level. I showed up at just after 6:00, opening time and more than a little concerned since I had neglected to bother purchasing an advance ticket. I was then relieved to see that some tickets were still available. Cost was relatively princely, at 6500 Yen. Ouch! Well, a drop in the bucket compared to what I had shelled out for this venture. At least the price included one beverage of my choice. <p/> Walking down the steps to the club entrance, you can see that one side, entered to the right, is basically a small bar with a few tables and chairs; the left entrance yields a cozy room with standing area for about 300, a decent-sized stage (for the purpose), a small bar, and on Saturday night, a girl spinning JBC tunes on two of two turntables. Immediately to the right as you walked in (providing of course, that you actually happened to be there), Vinyl Japan had set up a counter with most of the available JBC CD's, Max's, Dislocation Dance CD's, and... more JBC vinyl than I had ever seen (me having seen only Big Planet Scarey Planet on vinyl before). So, prepare to kick your collective selves, the following were present, and I'm sure I am forgetting some: Scandal in Bohemia, Distressed Gentlefolk, JBC We Love You (?), Bath of Bacon, and more I'm pretty sure. And before you ask, I didn't buy any of it, 'cept for Rotten Soul, and having bought Max's CD at Virgin earlier in the day. Also present were some JBC Japan Tour T-shirts, some JBC buttons and Dislocation Dance T-shirts. <p/> The crowd was... about 97% Japanese (imagine that!), and by 6:30 or so I would say more than 200 were patiently and politely milling about. Pat came out about that time, to little fanfare, and was surrounded by small groups who patiently waited their turn to say hello and to get various items autographed. Pat was extremely gracious, as he always seems to be, and sat on the floor signing records for 10 minutes or so. <p/> Promptly at 7:00 the show began with Max coming out and playing some of his tunes, soon to be joined by Owen on accordion. What can I say? Of course they both did a great job, both seeming pretty relaxed. Sound was really excellent, practically perfect in the small room, and to say you could hear a pin drop directly after and before the tunes would not be understatement. <p/> Max played for about 30 minutes and after a short break, Dislocation Dance came on. <p/> Dislocation Dance is a U.K. group that played together in the early '80's. I was told they had not played together since 1982. Vinyl Japan had re-released their CD('s?) and brought them over from U.K. The band was comprised of your typical pop instrumentation, with a female lead vocalist and a trumpet player. The drummer and trumpet player have been playing together professionally since the early '80's, if not before. Hope my info is correct. Anyway, they were an interesting complement to the JBC, extremely tight, extremely polished, and the trumpet player ad-libbed around their tunes all night (or at least for the 60 minutes they played). As well, they were well-received by the crowd (which included various members of the JBC, from whom I gleaned most of the above info, so speaking of which...) <p/> I was blessed to have been in the company of Max, Owen and Pat at various times during the DD set, as well as Max's sister Ann, and Steve's girlfriend Linda (Steve was running about somewhere but I did not speak with him until Sunday night -- I think). They were all quite down-to-earth, grateful to be in Japan, happy to be there, appeciative of the crowd -- you get the picture (and speaking of which I took about 50 digital photos -- a smattering of which might actually be decent and I'll send to David Whittemore for his posting disgression (okay, David?)). <p/> So, at around 8:45 or so the JBC came on. The playlist was what you have come to expect from this tour. A personal new favorite of mine is now Diamorphine. There was a bit of banter with the crowd, and some banter back, especially from the handful of, I believe, Japan-based Canadians that were jumping about in some contrast to the polite and jumping-about-to-a-lesser-extent Japanese crowd. I adhered myself to the fringe of the westerners group, or perhaps more specifically to Ann, and a good time was had by all. And so I guess I did not make too much of a spectacle of myself since Ann and Linda (and the band) were still speaking to me by the time the Sunday show rolled around. And perhaps I had been the subject of some post-show conversation on Saturday since on Sunday it was known to the band that I indeed trekked over from China (hey, it's only a 3.5 hour flight and I wasn't doing anything else of note last weekend). Pat, whom I had not given my name, came up to me Sunday and said \"you must be Ray from China.\""},{"gigtext_id":1059,"datetime":"2000-06-17","type":"review","credit":"Mio Sugita","credit_date":"2025-09-12","body":"Shinjuku Loft, Tokyo, June 17, 2000\n<p />\nPerfect day to hear \"Rain.\"\nI can't still believe the JBC Japan tour is really happening here in Japan.\nThe show started at seven o'clock with a short solo performance by Max\nEider.

Actually there are 3 separate parts or shops (4?) of Vinyl Japan in Shinjuku, each dedicated to one or more specific genres. Part 2 is the one for most of us to want to visit. On arrival, what was being played but Rotten Soul. I looked through the store's intersting indie and alt selections, finding and buying a promo Beck CD that seemed interesting. After purchasing it I asked, in English, as best I could to the helpful and non-English speaking staff if I could buy a ticket for the Sunday show. What appeared to be a ticket was put on the counter in front of me, at which point I tried in vain to purchase it, but my offer of Yen was somehow not accepted. I tried to explain again I wanted to buy the ticket. My attempt at explanation yielded only an offer of a second ticket which I declined. So, feeling like I had stolen a concert ticket, I slowly backed out the door. <p/> I wasn't completely sure that I had indeed received a free ticket until I got into the show, gratis (except for a mandatory 500 Yen drink purchase). <p/> After a bit of rest, I met up with David and his friend Ivor (sp?) (a burgeoning fan) near the train station and we made our way to the venue, arriving around 6:30. The crowd proceeded to be about 805543671260f what it'd been on Saturday night; a good turnout for a Sunday JBC show in Japan, we felt. I understand from Pat that a great deal of the crowd had been there the previous evening as well. <p/> Sunday, Pat did not come out before the show began, but he did show and cheer on Max and Owen during the opening set. I still do not recall seeing Steve right at that time, but I may not have been looking around too much. Again, I attached myself to Ann and Linda, did I mention they are both delightful people? They took my obsessive JBC-ishness in stride, or at least faked it well. I did have a chance to talk with Steve a little later in the evening, and of course he was just as pleasant and approachable as the Britishers. <p/> Max played a few different tunes than on Saturday night, and was equally as well received as before. Sound was once again great, I think. The crowd seemed a bit more animated Sunday, or maybe that was because Saturday's Canadian contingent was not there to provide the contrast. In any event, again, a good time was had by all. <p/> DD's set seemed similar to that of the previous evening. Perhaps they were a little more at ease compared to Saturday. Anyway, they all seemed to be enjoying themselves and the somewhat more responsive crowd. <p/> The JBC's set was a bit different than Saturday's; I believe they did not play \"She's a Yo Yo\" on Saturday night. Also, Pat came out solo for the first encore and played an old song about cats which I hadn't heard before. Very enjoyable of course. They seemed to have played a bit longer on Sunday, and afterward we stuck around during which time various autographs were dispensed. Briefly we retired to the bar opposite the stage side of the Loft, and despite Owen's efforts to bid me a good evening I tagged along for a pleasant and low-key dinner attended by both bands, some people from the label, and Ann and Linda. <p/> So, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. <p/> It was all great fun, I can't say when I 've spent a more enjoyable two consecutive evenings. Max's \"It Has To Be You\" is still playing in my head. <p/> And I'm still grinning."},{"gigtext_id":375,"datetime":"2000-06-20","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"<a href=\"/japan2000\">Pat's Japan 2000 Travelogue</a>"},{"gigtext_id":1067,"datetime":"2000-06-20","type":"review","credit":"Mio Sugita","credit_date":"2025-09-12","body":"Shinsaibashi Muse Hall, Osaka, June 20, 2000\n<p />\nI met the girl who was also at two JBC shows in Tokyo.

We came on stage, all neatly soundchecked, only to discover that the pad on the CD backing track was a whole semitone out with all the guitars! Now, I had just tuned the guitars (4 of 'em!), so I knew it wasn't that. What it was was that the house CD player was one of those DJ jobs with varispeed. Some prannet had obviously leaned on the varispeed button at some point, thrusting Wilson into the Omniverse. A quick appeal from the stage brought the house soundman hurtling across the dancefloor to \"reset devices\" and we carried on happily. <p/> 2. Having broken a string on my telecaster, I was delighted to see it reappear, fully strung-up, on my guitar stand. I picked it up for the start of \"Secret Government\" only to discover that it was in regular EADGBE tuning...which was odd, as it was supposed to be in an open D tuning. I had to spend the first verse of the sing dragging the tuning back. Thank God for silent tuners! Anyway, it all went smoothly enough and we carried on without incident. It was only about 3 songs later that I became aware that it wasn't my telecaster at all, but a look-alike kindly loaned by the other group! Doh! <p/> I tell ya - we thought we were SO well prepared! <p/> Still, for all those little irritations the set went down well. The audience was a fairly imposing bunch, about 100 strong, with pretty much every pro musician in town, along with various representatives from the Spacemen/Spiritualized axis, so it was quite a relief to hear people saying nice things about us. <p/> (It was even more fun to overhear bona-fide punters shouting \"brilliant\" at each other at the bar.) <p/> After the show we retired to Shakespeare Villas for a knees-up. Imagine our surprise when the entire staff of the club, promoter, manager, soundman and even a couple of barmaids showed up toting a crate of beer!

Johnson), B-Man (Ian Botterill, of <a href=\"https://www.sumosonic.com\" target=\"new\">Sumosonic</a> and Fat Controller) and G-Man (Steve Gordon of NN1 Tarantino Funk kingpins P-Hex) all distinguished themselves very well indeed. Only B-Man fell over. Conceivably he was doing this on purpose, but it rather depends on who you're talking to. E-Man, being The Bald One, got to do Eno and G-Man added chunk funk and razzle in a fine demonstration of What To Do With A Fender Twin. <p/> We were supposed to be playing around 9:00 pm, but early in the evening it transpired that, in fact, we were to headline a four band bill (it was easier on the drum kit situation, and all the other groups, being properly youthful, probably found us faintly intimidating anyway). Accordingly, Wilson took the stage about ten minutes before our ludicrous UK licensing laws closed the bar and about ten minutes mafter a steaming performance from the young and very talented Capdown. Capdown (short for \"Capitalist Downfall\", I'm told) are a rocking skatepunk n ska outfit who got the large and predominantly youthful crowd going something fierce. (You can catch them at this year's Reading Festival - Capdown, not the large and predominantly youthful lot.) <p/> Accordingly, we had a bit of a tough act to follow and very little time to get people over. And we only went and pulled it off. A lot of the younger punters began to mumble disconsolately at the sight of a bunch of grizzled pensioners starting up, and some wandered out into the warm night and the beer garden. By half way through the set, though, the mumblers were starting to dance and the gardeners began to return. <p/> With B-Man on fine form, having just received a spectacular and well-deserved kicking from one of the town's leading songwriters in the front bar, and with a powerful live sound from Geoff Kirk, our shit was truly swinging. Hollywood was duly incinerated (the sound of 10,000 enraged LA Korean store owners marching on the Mondrian Hotel) before Wilson laid their Dark Agenda upon the assembled and hideous guitar noise was the outcome. Thence to an old school Sumo party at the Agent's yard and a beastly hangover this morning.

Owen is explaining to Steve about today's JBC destination, Norfolk. The natives, he tells us, were only converted to Christianity in the 17th Century. To Steve, just off the plane from Downtown LA, this may be interesting cultural background. To me it is one more in a concatenation of signs that maybe this time the JBC have got themselves into something just a little bit too deep. <p/> It all started a few weeks back when The Talented One suggested that we might care to do a show on New Year's Eve at a smart people's country house hotel in deepest Norfolk that had somehow fallen into the hands of an old school pal of his. A hefty fee was on the cards, with hotel rooms and all our worldly demands fulfilled. Unsurprisingly, this struck your correspondent as being one of those Good Ideas. <p/> It also reminded me of a classic remark made by my good friend, George, a fifty year old shamanically-inclined Turkish aristocrat who has somehow managed to end up living over the fire station in Northampton NN1. During one of our habitual fireside conversations George had advised me that the citizens of Sheringham in Norfolk lived life in the \"classic, old-fashioned and normal style.\" It struck me that George would love to spend his New Year's Eve in a Norfolk country house hotel. <p/> Assuming, then, that we had lucked out getting booked by a load of mad rich rustics for their private New Year celebrations, the JBC said. <p/> It was only just before Christmas that it was revealed to us that this show was actually open to the public and that we were allowed, nay encouraged, to advertise it. At the same time we discovered that tickets were a positively Japanese &pound;45:00 a head and, perhaps unsurprisingly, they had not been selling that well. That big fat fee suddenly started to look a touch more theoretical. Nonetheless, by this stage we had all made our travel arrangements and booked some other UK shows besides, so we decided to go ahead with this mental scheme and have as many laughs as possible from the whole weird experience. <p/> In which, the reader will be glad to hear, we were in no wise disappointed. <p/> While the majority of the posse travel up from London by train, the hardcore rhythm section boys and gals drive with the equipment from NN1. <p/> Steve is at the wheel, superb in his handling of the ubiquitous \"roundabouts\" that plague the English roads. I navigate and Lynda sits between us, trying to get a glimpse of the English countryside as it flashes by. Kathie, Owen and George are in the back with the kit. Arranged on a big pile of cushions they cope well with life as freight until, somewhere east of Newmarket, the sun goes down. Then they go very quiet. <p/> About ten miles outside Norwich - perhaps twenty miles from our destination - there is a faintly desperate rapping on the wall that divides the freight from the front. <p/> \"Where are we?\" cries an audibly anxious Owen. <p/> I reassure him that we are not far from our target, and indeed soon we are pulling up in the snow-covered yard of an enormous old wooden mill perched over a river in a remote Norfolk backwater, which turns out, as fate would have it, to be only three or four miles from the place where in another life I recorded \"Cult of the Basement\" and \"Condition Blue\". <p/> The freight is released gratefully from the back of the Transit and we all waddle into the hotel's smart and attractive bar to warm up. <p/> We are greeted warmly and hospitably by the gentleman who booked us, but there is a detectable note of - shall we say - flakiness in the air. When the hard-bitten touring engine meets the well-intentioned but inexperienced amateur odd little things like securing one's room or a mat for the drum kit can become the source of unexpected dilemmas, which can lead to confusion, even frustration. Nonetheless, with the invaluable help of our support band, Tumbling Dice, we get everything sorted and zip through an encouraging soundcheck, which we complete just in time for dinner. <p/> Our table is huge and round. Somebody remarks that it's all a bit Arthurian. \"Yes,\" says Owen, \"And I know who King Arthur is.\" <p/> He is looking across the table directly at George. <p/> A top dinner ensues. The hotel clearly has a fine chef and we dine on all manner of good things, including the quite possibly the best chips to be had outside of Belgium. As we finish up, the dining room begins to fill with wholesome-looking families gathered in their best togs for a festive blow-out. It occurs to me that this might be a good time for the scary musicians to make themselves scarce, so I leg it up to my room and set about devising a list of tunes for tonight's show. <p/> It soon dawns on me that it would be stupid for me to try and assemble a set list without consultation with the rest of the band, so I find myself obliged to go looking for them back down in the dining room. As I arrive I find Steve, Lynda, Anne and Baerbel sitting at a beautifully set table with George and bottle of Champagne. It immediately becomes clear that it is George who has ordered the Champagne. <p/> Max and I slip away for a moment and construct a set list, which, we imagine fondly, will cause all manner of consternation among the rest of the band.

A duo with backing tracks of their own devising, they play a brilliant party set of covers from the songbooks of The Beatles and The Stones, with tunes by The Kinks and The Small Faces thrown in for good measure. They even do a Status Quo number! During this last I catch Claire out doing That Seventies Dance: you know, the one with the hands on the hips and the weird rhythmic spastic twitching at the waist. <p/> \"I bet they still dance like that round here,\" I tell her. Then I turn around and see a local couple about ten feet away - doing exactly that! <p/> While the dice are tumbling I also note that George, who generally never drinks, is well on his way. He is shaking his head to the sixties sounds like there is no tomorrow. I have never seen George rock so hard. <p/> Our set list is planned to break for the midnight shenanigans. We refuse to learn \"Auld Lang Syne\" and we don't want to ruin people's New Year party, so we have resolved to stop awhile for kissing and shouting at the auspicious hour. This entails our starting at exactly 11:10pm. We finally make it onstage to start at 11:18pm, but no matter we have found a clock that can be seen from the stage, so we fondly imagine that we are in control. <p/> As we take the stage I essay a short speech to explain to the few natives gathered what exactly the fuck is liable to be going on. As you probably know, the JBC only generally play in places where people want to see them. (It makes life so much more pleasant for band and punters alike, we feel.) <p/> This is clearly not the case tonight, so I give a little spiel about how.. well, you know how all the bands say they're different.. well, we really are different because different. <p/> Yeah, nice one, Pat. <p/> From the first number it's clear that the improvised sound system and the under-rehearsed JBC are both working as well as they possibly could. Within a couple of tunes dancing has broken out. A couple of tunes later I look up to see George leaping two-footed into the air. A few songs down the road and Owen's floor tom-tom collapses on top of his pint, shattering the glass and scattering beer everywhere. He mends the drum, sorts out a new pint and puts it back down. A few minutes later the drum collapses again, with more shattered glass and squandered beer. But we are having fun. <p/> We arrive at the first Tower Of Misery And Despair. <p/> Diamorphine goes off like a big mental bomb. <p/> We cruise through some pop songs and a particularly sociopathic Wheeler and make it to the midnight break without problems. <p/> Champagne is opened. Hugs and kisses all round. Everybody has made it into 2002. <p/> We pick up again some ten minutes down the road with a nicely paced Spacemen and reel on through the rest of our show. People, God bless them, are going mental. Not even Sister Death can stop them. (My excuse goes along the lines of: \"Well, you can't have a dance without a waltz, boys and girls, now can you?\" To my astonishment, I get away with it.) <p/> We finish with a typically vile rendition of Zombie Love, then encore with Roadrunner. By the end of it I am barking like a big stupid dog. <p/> Everyone is astoundingly kind about our show. While Tumbling Dice return to play a couple more top party tunes we chill the fuck out with bottles of Champagne and the rest. A top soul DJ takes over and the party goes on until about 4:00am, by which time, thoroughly mashed, Kathie, George and I retire to our room with one final bottle of Champagne and a bunch of Rizlas. <p/> We awake the following day to beautiful winter sun on the river beneath our window. Somehow, for God is great, we have survived JBC Vietnam. <p/> <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/max_eider.html\">Max Eider</a> </span> a.k.a.

By Friday we are about ready to take on The Hardest Room In The World, that is to say the back room of the Racehorse in Abington Square NN1, also known as The Heart O'Darkness. We arrive to find The Man Skinner setting up the PA. Is he the new <a href=\"/people/iain_ohiggins.html\">O'Higgins</a>, we wonder with a shudder. The room itself has been beautifully decked out in drapes, with a huge multi-coloured parachute hanging over the stage. <p/> The London posse arrives and Max heads off to the local music shop to get some bits and pieces, among them a drum key for Owen. When he returns shortly he hands this to Owen, announcing that he got it for free. The Butcher is astonished: <p/> You got something from the music shop for free? That's a fucking first! \"Fuck off,\" replies Skinner, \"I work in that shop!\" (Which shows how long it has been since I shopped there.) <p/> In the end we agree that being sneering, dismissive and condescending probably counts as a perk of the job. After all, think how many times a month these poor bastards get to hear <i>Sweet Child O'Mine.</i> <p/> After a fairly uneventful soundcheck (that's what we pay for) we retire to JBC Central, where Kathie has somehow managed to cook up dinner for everybody. <p/> Great dressing room, this - almost like being in your own living room. <p/> We arrive back at the venue at half past eight. Apart from Kathie and George, bravely manning the door, there are two people in the room! Now, it's fair to say that this show was organised pretty much at the last minute, but this is scary. Still, we get some beers in and wait, and sure enough the place soon begins to fill up. As we hit the magic \"double figures\" mark, somebody remarks \"JBC friends and family night.\" <p/> The crowd is still fairly thin as the great <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/curtis_johnson.html\">Curtis E. Johnson</a> </span> takes the stage. He plays a fine set featuring a load of new songs. He has started using a Line 6 delay unit to make layers of sound with the one guitar, and it works well. Except, that is, when he essays a version of Suicide's <i>Rocket USA</i> only to discover that he has forgotten to switch the thing on! Still, he succeeds in mutating the tune into his own wonderful <i>Point Blank</i> and concludes his set on a high note. <p/> While Curtis is singing, the JBC are delighted to note the arrival of one <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/sonic_boom.html\">Sonic Boom</a> </span> in the area. Mysteriously Pat and Steve follow him into a small cupboard by the side of the stage, from which they do not emerge for some time <p/> Not long after the emergence of the JBC Stoner Tendency, the band takes the stage. By now the room has filled up a little more. We are probably playing to about 50 people. That's Death Week for you. Of those 50 punters probably 35 are musicians themselves, including all the members of Wilson. That's intimidation for you. Well, for us, anyway. <p/> Skinner has sorted us a good, strong sound and we get off to a fine start with <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/mr_odd.html\">Mr. Odd</a></i> </span> and <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/shes_on_drugs.html\">She's On Drugs</a></i> </span> before throwing The Punter a fairly radical curve and starting up <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/who_loves_you_now.html\">Who Loves You Now?</a></i> </span>. In this room it's somehow very hard to establish eye contact with the audience (it's so dark out there), but I keep facing them down as best I can as we move on through The Talented One's Spot, whacking out <span class='song'> <i>Rosemarie</i> <span class=\"song_author\">(Max Eider)</span> </span> and <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/diamorphine.html\">Diamorphine</a></i> </span>, which marks some kind of major step in the set, as indeed it always seems to do. <p/> It's only as we move on into <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/rain.html\">Rain</a></i> </span> \"from the sublime to the ridiculous\" (as I remark at the time) that I close my eyes, more in embarrassment at the creaky 19 year old lyric than in any kind of rock ecstasy. <p/> I then manage to bring the intro of <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/soul_happy_hour.html\">Soul Happy Hour</a></i> </span> to a grinding halt, accidentally trying out an entirely new intro revolving around the Special Upmarket Waitrose Superstore (on account of I'm 44), which leaves everybody without a clue as to when the tune proper should start. <p/> This is followed by <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/caroline_wheeler.html\">Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present</a></i> </span> before Owen starts up the groovy beat to <span class='song'> <i>Come\\, Friendly Spacemen</i> </span>. Sumo vocalist Mr. B. is in the house and keen to run up and join in, but he is frustrated by a crowd of thirsty punters for he is working behind the bar. <p/> I have to manage on my own. <p/> After <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/niagara.html\">Niagara</a></i> </span>, dedicated to the hole in the bathroom ceiling at JBC Central, we unpack <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/sister_death.html\">Sister Death</a></i> </span> from its big black box. It's a storming version, and as it comes to a fiery end I find myself baffled that we ever thought to put anything after it in the list. But we have, and it's <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/partytime.html\">Partytime</a></i> </span>! We finish with <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/zombie_love.html\">Zombie Love</a></i> </span>, one of those versions where everything ends up playing on a mad off-beat, huge dirty great noises bouncing off each other in what is only theoretically 4/4 time. The thing ends in total chaos and destruction and, like Germans, the punters of NN1 reserve their loudest applause for the end. <p/> We play two encores, a version of <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/girlfriend.html\">Girlfriend</a></i> </span> that seems livelier and more committed than it has in years (possibly something to do with the location), and a romping <span class='song'> <i>Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)</i> </span>, with Curtis adding his own distinctive rapping skills (\"Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off!\") <p/> People are very kind as we leave the stage. Sonic is particularly taken with the skills of Mr. Beirne, who wasn't with us on our last visit to NN1 in the summer. We take care not reveal Pat's telephone number: industrial confidentiality and all that. A quick check reveals that we have taken just about enough money on the door to pay everybody hurrah! Skinner is duly sorted out and the kit packed away. <p/> Then something rather wonderful happens. There is a bar in NN1, named after the celebrated radical MP Charles Bradlaugh, which now has a license to continue serving until 1:00am. I know that this might not seem too impressive to our overseas readers, but in the UK this is still something rare and precious. It is with great satisfaction that the JBC and their friends leave the gig, walk a couple of hundred yards up the street and settle down for a civilised post-concert drink. Not, it has to be said, all that civilised: those who were there just minutes before we arrived were witness to a massive barroom brawl. Still, it has all blown over by the time we make it in, so no problems there. <p/> I'm chatting to Steve from Wilson when Lynda appears and asks if they have Jaegermeister here. I am forced to say that they don't, and my mind turns to trying to come up with an equally frightening and viscous local liqueur. I settle on Drambuie. <p/> Long ago, back before Air Rage had been invented, I found myself \"doing\" Drambuies with a young actor on a flight back from Los Angeles. I found myself moved to tell a joke one whose punch line must of necessity be screamed out at top volume. Owing largely to the Drambuies I had failed to notice that I was delivering this punch line right in the middle of the transatlantic night, with everybody else on the plane fast asleep. A slightly panicky waitress - oh, so sorry, - Flight Attendant soon brought home to me what I had just done. I suppose if it had happened this year I would have ended up sharing a cell with celebrated joghurt-slosher Peter Buck. <p/> I haven't had a lot of Drambuie since that incident, but I remember it with affection. Heaven knows why: one mouthful and we are all agreed that it's revolting stuff! <p/> We drink until closing time, and then it's back to JBC Central for a party. <p/> Yes, we have a show tomorrow. No, we haven't forgotten. Yes, we end up getting to bed at about six in the morning. But this is NN1 and we wouldn't have it any other way."},{"gigtext_id":411,"datetime":"2002-01-05","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Just confirmed the support for the Garage show on 5th January. <p/> It's The Sunny Valley Dance Band.

Pat Beirne, Max and Tamaki head straight for the train to London. As Max later points out, this actually allows them to go home before immediately setting out again for the venue. You see, Gentle Reader, why they let me navigate the bus. <p/> The hardcore heads for the Cafe Rico on Abington Square, where your correspondent suffers his usual series of minor aneurisms at the content of Saturday's Guardian. Full Veggie Breakfast is the order of the day, and, duly restored, we head across the road to collect our kit from the pub, where we abandoned it last night in search of nocturnal urban delights. <p/> All right, then - a drink at the Bradlaugh. <p/> We pass by JBC Central to shower and to pick up George for the trip to London. As we board the bus, Kathie is in the driving seat, looking utterly miserable and racked with the flu that has been so fashionable in our neighbourhood ever since Depak The Shopkeeper developed it after opening what he thought was a parcel of specialist pornography from an address in Uzbekistan. Ever chivalrous and apparently indestructible, Steve swiftly takes the wheel and we pass a pleasant journey to London. During the trip we hatch a plot for the Great American Action Movie Of The Future. This is confidential copyright shit, so I'm not going to lay it on you here. All you movie producers in LA and Hong Kong and Bollywood are just going to have to e-mail me via the site and we'll talk. <p/> We arrive at The Garage on the very stroke of 5:00pm and load in our shit through the strange backstage labyrinth that has, over the years, become known to us as The Birth Canal Of Rock. (It's hard to explain unless you've done it. Those of you who have will understand at once, I'm sure.) <p/> Soundcheck is remarkable only for its ease. (Thanks, Rich!) We greet our esteemed opening act, The Sunny Valley Dance Band, and they are still soundchecking as the posse heads out for dinner. George, Kathie and I are joined by our good friend Bob Goodman as we head across the road to that splendid little trattoria on the Holloway Road called Spiazzo. Bob, of course, is an ex-Doctor-Who-Monster and the author of <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/hobbu.html\">The Hobbu Song</a></i> <span class=\"song_author\">(Robert Goodman)</span> </span>. He could also use a job right now, so do write in, won't you? <p/> This Spiazzo place really is very nice and not very expensive at all. <p/> I enjoyed a Pizza Buffala (well, you're forced to, ain't ya?) with mozzarella and fresh tomatoes. They serve Budvar too. Go there. Eat and be happy. <p/> After espressos we pass by a nearby bar, where I am happy to greet Mister Edwards, writer and fellow Tottenham Hotspur FC fan, in town from Pittsburgh, where he has been living lately. Also, scarcely credibly, I find myself face to face with the man who has, since last summer, come to be known to us as <a href=\"/people/peter_crouch.html\">No Show Crouchy</a>. <p/> Sunny Valley are already on stage as we return to the club. They are a trio, made up of: <p/> Mark Refoy - Guitar, singing<br/> Vanessa - Bass, Singing<br/> Andy - Drums <p/> Mark, of course, is my pal from NN1, who played in Slipstream, The Tell-Tale Hearts, <a href=\"http://www.spiritualized.com/\" target=\"new\">Spacemen 3</a> and Spiritualised. The others were in Ultrasound. They come from way up north, Sunderland, possibly, though I can't be sure and I wouldn't want to hurt their feelings by placing them in the wrong town. Whatever, they live in London now. <p/> Vanessa's got a song about it. <p/> The chorus appears to run \"Save my soul!\" <p/> Sunny Valley make an extraordinary noise, deep and rumbling, yet drenched in melody and harmony. Mark is a beautiful guitar player and Vanessa has a voice to bring down the walls of Jericho. Spotting <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/dooj_wilkinson.html\">Dooj Wilkinson</a> </span> in the audience, I rush up to share with him an idea that I have been nursing since I first saw the band: \"Dooj - that's the girl you're going to marry!\" <p/> (It is not without satisfaction that I later discover that they have exchanged telephone numbers.) <p/> Then I find myself next to Juan-Carlos, a devoted Spacemen fan from Lima, Peru, who shows up at a fair few of our gigs. Perhaps naively, I ask him if he likes Sunny Valley. \"Pat,\" he replies, looking at me as though I have lost my mind, \"That's Mark Refoy.\" Yeah, that's good enough, as it goes. This is a fucking beautiful band. <p/> They haven't released anything yet, but when they do you should just go straight down the record store and buy it. It'll be brilliant. <p/> Sunny Valley finish with <i>Everything</i>, a wonderful Refoy composition that Slipstream used to play in their last, dark days. I haven't told anybody this before, but the night that <a href=\"https://www.sumosonic.com\" target=\"new\">Sumosonic</a> got dropped off Creation I sat and played that song over and over again, tears streaming down my face. <p/> It felt fucking great. <p/> It feels the same way tonight. <p/> Gorgeous. <p/> In due course we line up to start. The hall is full, pleasingly, but there is even less room up on the little stage. Things kick off well, though, and we are cruising through <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/who_loves_you_now.html\">Who Loves You Now?</a></i> </span> when The Talented One's amplifier starts to sound distinctly dodgy. By the end of the tune it has all but given out entirely, but thanks to Rich's quick thinking we soon plumb Eider directly into the PA. It sounds surprisingly good, not least because, thank God, Max programmes his sounds directly into an effects unit before they ever go any further down the pipe. The set rolls on with nary a bump. <p/> <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/diamorphine.html\">Diamorphine</a></i> </span> is, if anything, better even than <a href=\"/gigs/2002/Jan4_2100.html\">last night</a>. And this time we have the sense to follow it with <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/partytime.html\">Partytime</a></i> </span>, which makes a lot more sense than <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/rain.html\">Rain</a></i> </span>. Thence to <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/girlfriend.html\">Girlfriend</a></i> </span>, a special request, not perhaps as evil as the night before, but definitely still carrying a sting. We finish with another deep <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/sister_death.html\">Sister Death</a></i> </span>. People weep. Literally. <p/> We get called back for <span class='song'> <i><a href=\"/lyrics/soul_happy_hour.html\">Soul Happy Hour</a></i> </span> and <span class='song'> <i>Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)</i> </span>, a rather more cheerful way to say thanks to all the people who have come out to see us on this cold and dismal night just after Christmas. The eleven o'clock curfew in force at the venue means that we can do no more. A few people say to me later that it's a shame we don't play longer, but that's just a fact of life on the UK scene. Bands are rarely expected to play for longer than 45 minutes, and the time just doesn't get allotted. Tell you what I expect a lot of those British bands can't play for longer than 45 minutes. <p/> Bah! <p/> We spend a happy half hour back in the dressing room, drinking and smoking with our friends. There are people here tonight who have been coming to see the JBC since <a href=\"/gigs/1983\">1983</a> or <a href=\"/gigs/1984\">1984</a>. Some of them used to be rock journalists (got proper jobs now). Several of them tell me that the band is better than it has ever been. These are people who stopped feeling the need to flatter us way back, when we threw up on them or accidentally shot their dogs or something, so I take their comments seriously and it makes me happy and not sad. <p/> The only faintly jarring note is the demise of Max's amplifier. <p/> Mark is stalking the backstage area distraught, convinced that he has killed it during the Sunny Valley set. Max is more philosophical and doesn't apportion any blame to Mark, but it isn't easy to see your amp suddenly go down after almost 20 years of trusty service. Good-bye, old horse, and all that. Kathie and I resolve to try and get the thing fixed at the splendid Phoenix Soundworks in Earls Barton. So resolved, we head for the bar and spend a very pleasant few minutes drinking with Mister Dooj Dooj. <p/> Then, indecently satisfied with our string of odd little dates, we retreat to the street and load the van. The London Posse disappears in a cab, while the hardcore travel back to NN1 in the van, enjoying Bob Marley on the radio and learning, via the same medium, that <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/curtis_johnson.html\">Curtis E. Johnson</a> </span> and Syd Barrett share a birthday. Somewhere along the way it is decided that, \"on our return to JBC Central, we should smoke a shed load of marijuana.\" <p/> And this we do. <p/> I should like to extend the grateful thanks of the JBC to all those who booked us, helped us or came to see us. Especially I would like to thank Kathie Schaer for the loan of her bass amplifier and Jonny Mattock for the loan of his drum kit. And a special shout to Tour Manager George. <p/> It was real, mate! <p/> Pat Fish 2002"},{"gigtext_id":406,"datetime":"2002-01-15","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Supported by Messrs.

It probably cost him less than Max and I paid out on taxis across town to the venue. <p/> Once the thoroughly agreeable house staff had been persuaded to move their Playstation off the stage, sound checks went easily under the supervision of the 12-Bar's excellent house sound man Allessandro. Max and I retired to the dressing room (which is possibly slightly larger than the auditorium in this particular venue) to write and learn our set. We hadn't actually done a duo show like this since last time <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/wolfgang_tschegg.html\">Wolfgang Tschegg</a> </span> was over, back in the summer of 1999, and we were feeling a bit unsure of ourselves. After a run of band shows it's a touch intimidating to get up there without the backing of the JBC Intercontinental Rhythm Machine. <p/> Short on time, we dined at the venue (the veggie burgers are large!) while some fellow from England pretended to be Jeff Buckley in the background. Having heard the real Jeff Buckley when he supported the JBC in New York in 1992, your correspondent reserved the right to be a touch sneering, dismissive and condescending. The thing is, boys and girls, we all agreed: there is far too much of this sort of thing going on at the moment. <p/> Once Mini-Jeff had got it all out of his system, Wolfgang's Austrian friend stepped up to deliver one or two songs of fragile beauty before the man himself appeared, looking sharp in one his favoured shiny Euro-gigolo shirts and toting my own black Telecaster. He played through a selection of highlights from <span class=\"release_title\"><b>gigolo jet</b></span> and his most recent release, <span class=\"release_title\"><b>finder</b></span>\n, with great confidence and style. There were new songs in the set too, notably <span class='song'> <i>In Dieser Grossen Strassen</i> </span> and the ineffable <span class='song'> <i>Helicopter</i> </span>. This last is Wolfgang just the way we like him, all surging fat ambient pad and chiming guitar, not in the least compromised by its knock-out opening line: \"Helicopter nimm mich mit.\" <p/> About half way through the set in walks my good friend Joe Foster, record producer and gentleman adventurer, who has literally stumbled upon the night on his way back from the Warner Brothers offices where he has been working. Joe was actually in Vienna on the night we first saw Wolfgang play, so happy re-unions all round, then. <p/> During his set Wolfgang had been speaking in English and singing in German, so it seemed only natural that Eider and I should start our set by singing in French. The two Italian girls in the front row were becoming visibly confused. We laid down a fairly soporific set of tunes, but a prett. <p/> People were very kind and yelled for an encore, but at the end of the last tune I had shredded my 36, if you know what I mean, and with no spare guitar to hand, that had to be that. Later a brave American lady jumped up to take on the graveyard shift while the rest of us got pissed up. Everybody got paid and Wolfgang took a night bus back to his friends pad in South London. His next intended destination was Dartmoor, so I tooled him up with Gabriel's phone number, and indeed he was in residence when Gabe and I spoke on the phone last night.

Once again the cheeky music hall eccentrics demonstrated their complete inability to come to terms with the Space/Time continuum by performing with a line-up that blatently flouted the very principles of quantum physics as they are understood today. <p/> The Conspiracy, represented on this occasion by ringleaders Pat Fish and Max Eider, began the evening in August 1982, playing a selection of their cult songs from their first album, \"Bath Of Bacon\" recorded in the year of the Falklands War. But this was no simple effort at reviving a lost era of indie-pop mediocrity. Deprived of his usual effects unit (whose power supply he had left back in Lodon), Eider actually managed to recreate his exact sound from a concert in the upstairs room of a quaint London pub style venue in November 1982, while Fish's inept caterwaulings and scratchy amateurish strumming had listeners longing for the DJ to play some Bronski Beat or fine Young Cannibals. <p/> Amid rumours that members of talented doom-rockers Bauhaus were in attendance (it turned out to be the head of the Love & Rockets fan club), the dentally-challenged Fish and the frankly alarming Eider played through a selection of ancient garbage before throwing the audience a curve ball with the inclusion of the song \"Whaddya?\", recorded long after Eider left the group. <p/> Owing the the spectacularly shakey performance of the tune, many failed to notice that the eclectic duo had departed from the norms of reality and were in fact engaged in an assault on the very fabric of the universe itself. <p/> Experts are undecided on how exactly the British fops were able to effect their ultimately nightmarish bending of time and space, but Doktor Herbert Pruegler of the Berlin Institute of Home Economics believes that an apparently endless rendition of the song \"Sister Death\", followed by a period of some five minutes during which the guitar-toting deviants played only the chord of D Major, may have had the effect of temporarily bringing the passing of time to a standstill. At any rate, after a moment of collective amnesia, or \"lost time\" as X-philes might have it, the audience became aware that Eider and Fish had been joined onstage by guitarist/producer Richard \"Lenin\" Formby. The traditional rock \"old pals\" act had an bizarre twist, however: Eider had left the band before <span class=\"person\"> <a href=\"/people/richard_formby.html\">Richard Formby</a> </span> ever joined, and Formby had already disappeared from the JBC circle before Eider ever re-joined. Long-term students of forteana will recall a similar incident in 1995 when Eider was supposedly spotted on stage in London alongside <a href=\"/people/peter_crouch.html\">Peter \"Something Simple For The Weekend\" Crouch</a>, the JBC guitarist who infamously became an air hostess in 1993 before going on to Premier League success with the Aston Villa soccer club. <p/> Owing to the practical difficulties of warping the space/time continuum in such an outrageous fashion, the dandyish and heavily moustachioed Formby experienced a few problems with his equipment before starting to play. It soon became clear that the Conspiracy's disrespect for the laws of physics was matched only by its cavalier attitude towards its own material: for \"Mister Odd\" Eider found himself laying down the rhythmic chord backing alone, while Fish and Formby insisted on both playing the same guitar solo simultaneously. Professor Haskins of the University of Hawaii suspects that this might have been a device to \"fix\" the astonishing temporo-historical wormhole which they had constructed. <p/> The performance continued with a rendition of \"Girl-Go\" from 1990's album \"Cult of Debasement\" whereon Eider and Formby fought an aerial dogfight reminiscent of the later years of the first World War. Towards the end of the version all pretence of chord structure was abandoned in favour of a heinous squalling, droning row. An ensuing version of the brutalist paean to necrophilia \"Zombie Love\" saw the quaint Brits returning to the 14th Century, reproducing a chillingly accurate sonic portrayal of the Black Death that decimated the audiences - sorry, population - of Mediaeval Europe. <p/> After noisy demands from the audience to be returned to the 21st Century forthwith, Eider and Fish returned to the stage for a valedictory version of \"Drink\" before retiring to a secret laboratory for debriefing and refreshment. The majority of the stunned listeners left the venue to find themselves returned to the early 21st Century, but a small number remain stranded in a dark and evil place somewhere between 1983 and 1993 with no obvious means of egress. Emergency services are doing as much as they can, but say that they are in urgent need of parapsychological assistance from experts in St. Petersburg last seen in 1991. President Tony Blur has appealed for information, while Minister of the Interior David Blunkett has sworn to outlaw any further interference with the fabric of space and time by pot-smoking oddballs.

The sun shone and we enjoyed looted champagne and a great deal of herb.

P-Hex graced us with Tarantino Funk and a truly, authentically incompetent God Save The Queen; some band with inflammable dreadlocks and jungle elephants made a punky ska sort of row; UK Waste are just unbelievable altogether - what are they playing at, eh? What's it all about? - Screwface did Full Metal Jackoff by the Dead Kennedys and Wilson did Police and Thieves. <p/> After the raffle we played God's Green Earth and told entire swathes of British society to go and feck themselfs with a stick at night, entirely careless of the possible consequences. People were weeping in the aisles. Several floppy-haired types from villages were trapped in the alley where Peter Wyngarde was arrested for cottaging and triumphantly torched by the inflamed republican mob.

The day began with a phone call booking the band for a second gig in Belgium...rock! We got on the road at a fairly reasonable hour, Baerbel kissed us all good luck, and we were on our way. <p/> Everyone was still a bit weary from the night before, not to mention getting up at an unGodly hour to watch football. The drive was long, but we reached N&uuml;remberg in about 6 hours or so. The initial plan was to go straight on to Munich, but Pat's judgment at N&uuml;remberg (pun intended) was to stay the night and pick up the additional two hours or so the next day. <p/> The hotel we stayed at was French, and had all of the modern conveniences of a plastic room with a mattress on the floor. Indeed, we got onto the elevator, which promptly trapped us until Owen smartly came to look for us. Good thing, too...for we know what happens when you leave a Fish too long in an elevator (don't we?)...Also, no phones in the room (hence, no internet connection, hence no report...QED) <p/> I enjoyed a much needed shower and a good night's sleep, and in the morning, we had breakfast outside a small cafe. We again took to the autobahn, arriving in Munich mid-afternoon. <p/> After setting up, the band did a rehearsal (since they hadn't had one...even prior to the Hamburg gig) and really tightened up. By soundcheck they were in the groove, and well looking forward to the show. <p/> The club owner prepared dinner for all, after which I went for a stroll. Former JBC alum Peter 'No Show' Crouch turned up, to everyone's delight. I ran merchandise before and after the show, and once again got to be 'JBC answer man', a job I am uniquely suited for. Pat decided that I was in charge of 'Public relations', and was pleased with the number of CDs that sold...so I am earning my keep. <p/> The show itself was great: a nice club, a good audience, and the band was keen to play. Crouchy even got up (after a chant of 'Crou-chy, Crou-chy') and played on 'Zombie Love'. Three or four of the people that I sold CDs to hadn't heard of the band before, so that itself speaks to the performance. <p/> Tonight we are all flopping in one big room over the club... Beds strewn about the floor, slumber party style. In the morning, the band plans to go to the pub to watch more football. (The good thing about not being into sports is, you get to sleep in.) Then we make our way back to Nuremburg for the show there. No cheap French hotel tomorrow though, an old friend of Owen's will be putting us up. <p/> So to bed, to dream of windmills off the autobahn and breakfast strudel.

This time, Crouchy was with us...making the crowded bus even more crowded...but, the more the merrier with the JBC. <p/> The club... how shall I say it? Well, it made the bus seem positively spacious. But, with the JBC it's roll up your sleeves and get to it. After sound check, our hostess du jour, Katarina (an old friend of Owen's) took us for a stroll en route to get dinner. We went walking through the garden of a castle that overlooks the city...and me without my camera, grrr...but it was gorgeous. We all just sort of strolled in silence, soaking in the beautiful surroundings. <p/> For dinner, we sat outside a small cafe, and while my vegetarian comrades ordered Camenbert and potato pancakes, I felt compelled comrades ordered Camenbert and potato pancakes, I felt compelled to try the ostrich.

The sound was excellent, and though the crowd was small, they were impossibly enthusiastic, demanding no less than three encores. <p/> After the show we went to an Irish pub, where a horrible British cover band was playing. It occurred to me that I was in Germany, listening to a British Band in an Irish pub doing covers of 'Boston'. It was like the UN...if Butros Butros Ghali played piss poor Jimmy Page licks.

But all I saw of it was quaint and rustic living. <p/> We arrived in Kortrijk. It was to be an outdoor show, and lo! the outdoor in question was a serene garden affair...gorgeous, and the weather, perfect for a concert outside. Max confessed that he was sorry to disrupt the serenity...and so the show began rather quietly. Turns out, those in attendance very much enjoyed the squelch. <p/> The sound technicians were TOP! Sooo much can vary from venue to venue, but these guys were true professionals. The sound was glorious. There were several 'punters', but many sort of stumbled upon the event. There was a family sitting dead center, young and old. Kathy and I were certain that these were fans by their response, but they came up to us afterwards and informed us that they had just come in to eat, but LOVED the band. (Kathy & I laughed as the father bounced his daughter on his knee singing 'sha la la la, ooh my my - she's on drugs'.) <p/> Our host du jour was another old friend of Owen's by the name of Jean Pierre. He is a very earthy guy with an intense love of music. He positively BEAMED during the show. Afterwards, we all had dinner & drinks (I should mention, I am still the sober man I was when I left, tempting though it might be) and were escorted by Jean Pierre to our accommodations for the next few days. <p/> The farmhouse!

I sang Owen the ComedySportz birthday song, which he enjoyed (I guess if you've never heard it before, it's still funny). We watched football (Italy vs. South Korea) which was (apparently) the most exciting game of the cup thus far (overtime, with Korea pulling it out with a beautiful header in the final minutes). Okay...I confess, I have taken the most PASSING interest in the sport. It's the obsession here, so...when in Rome, or Belgium as the case may be.... <p/> A cat had had kittens in the shed. The runt of the litter, the cutest & friendliest, Owen named 'Corea'(sic) for the victors in that morning's cup. Lengthy debate was held as to the logistics of bringing the kitten on the bus back to Hamburg. In the end, Owen thinks he will go back in a few month's time, and retrieve the tiny cutie. <p/> We went to the venue, situated right next to the cathedral, and got set up. Another outdoor show...more punters, and even more passersby. This was a two-set deal, and the first set, found Pat a bit reserved. He was disconcerted by the huge number of people, yet the mere smattering of applause. We informed him that everyone was drinking, and therefore, no one had hands free to clap. Armed with this information (not to mention Pat finding some kind of undisclosed inspiration in-between sets), the band launched into the second half in high gear, filling the square with the 'ROCK show'...a far cry from the more pop-flavored garden show of two nights before. Beers were being dropped in favor of clapping and cheering. This was the sound of the band having fun, and Pat in particular going positively MENTAL. Needless to say, the band went after the post-show festivities with a similar fervor to that of the show itself. Max nearly had to drag Steve from the pub at the end of it. We left Jean Pierre DJ-ing the night away. <p/> We gave Owen his birthday cake and gift, complete with card (which I illustrated) signed by all.

Curt was away in a foreign land on special familial business. Steve Ward did the sound and Johnny P the lights. <p/> The Racehorse bar stages musical acts every Sunday. Some nights you barely notice they are there, even though there are only about 15 drinkers in the bar. Some acts do pull in a small crowd of mates. And that's what we'd normally expect. All right, we're older, so we know a few more mates. We put on some lights, try to do a decent sound, we get a few people in and hopefully they enjoy it. We get paid, but we spend that on getting in a good pa and lights. Last night when Johnny P and I came in from dinner, the place was fecking heaving. <p/> MC Bot was enjoying his birthday, and to please him we put The Streets on the pa about 15 minutes before we went on, a move of staggering arrogance and over-confidence, the sort of move that really filled me with karma terror. The sort of thing we do all the fecking time, to be honest. Some kids waiting to see the group actually split when The Streets came on. At the back of the room a small knot of middle-aged men were shouting along and making clenched-fist gestures in a display more suited to men half their age, to whom such things are supposed still to matter. <p/> As we took tthe stage I saw that Bot was toting some manner of ray gun. It turned out to fire bubbles. Stevie Ward brought up my vocal mic just in time to catch me wailing \"Sharon! Shaaaarrrroooooon!\" But I mean, really. Here we are, the princes and princess of the feckin' heart of darkness, and he's letting off fecking bubbles. What's evil about feckin' bubbles? SHAAARROOOOOOON!!!!!!!! Quality People kicked in like a bomb hitting the place, more or less. By the end the punters were cheering. Punters do not cheer in the Racehorse bar of a Sunday night. It doesn't happen. But these punters were cheering. \"Happy Birthday, Bot!\" cried Bot, instantly establishing the catch-phrase of the night. He had also, by now, fully mastered the technique of wringing as much feedback from his radio mic as humanly possible. For the rest of the night, more on stage than among the punters, it was like the fecking Mary Chain up there. WHOOOOOOOO- WHOOP- WHHHHEEEEEUUUUURRRRRRGGGGHHHHSSSSSSSZTSST... <p/> The rest of the sound was pretty hard, though. Misery was positively subsonic. Russ got a rake of cavernous reverb on his congas for Hippy Shit. We did the best \"Trouble Every Day\" since the Mothers stopped doing it. Bot was delivered of drinks from the crowd throughout and only did a Dooj on my FX pedals once. Hey, it was his birthday. Once he has the paperwork for. We got away with two brand new tunes. Good old crowd, good old night, way beyond our expectations. And those of Pete the Landlord, I would imagine. He must have made a pile of money on the bar. Many of the people in his bar were Quite Drunk at the end of the evening. <p/> We headed back to Shakespeare Villas, currently more like Shakespeare International House Of Leaves, where a party developed involving the band, plus members of Saab 77 and The Echo Chamber down from Leeds, P-Hex (Stevie G's enormous funk band), The Sheep Thieves and Hinterhoff Records. Becks and Budvar were drunk, as was Scott the boy detective. We closed at about 4:30 am. Not bad for a Sunday night at the local. Not bad at all. <p/> Seriously, Dave, we rocked the joint. <p/> Wilson Headstone technical update: Now deploying a Hughes and Kettner Tour Reverb combo, a solid state job with a tube-in-a-box on the way in. Tube in a box. Watch it glow in the dark. This also is the work of Mr. Hughes and Mister Kettner. The amp offers me three channels, and the tube thingie effectively offers two more variations. With the Burns guitar that I picked up earlier this summer it makes a mortal racket. Also deploying a Boss phaser and an Ibanez delay. Mind your heads, boys and girls. <p/> Botty: \"We're called Wilson...because we make a racket.\" <p/> Roadmender next, a nice big room where we shall have films as well as lights. The day after that we play a party in Wales. In October, God help us, we're playing at somebody's wedding.

This fairly charmless council-sponsored venue has played host to the likes of Paul Weller, The Manic Street Preachers, Primal Scream and The Damned. Back in the day it was the local port of call for Spacemen 3, the Perfect Disaster and, yes, the JBC. More recently, after a multi-million pound facelift, it has been the venue for some top performances from Culture, Ernest Ranglin, Julian Cope and the mighty Tuvan ensemble Yat-Kha. Gregory Isaacs was here too recently, but I wasn't na&iuml;ve enough to think that my promise of a place on the guest list would work, so I missed that one. <p/> Our date is not being promoted by the club itself. It is the work of an organisation called \"The Voice\", which appears to be a faintly educational affair, run by an amiable Scouse hobbit called Bill. This shameless optimist has booked no fewer than six acts for this evening's entertainment. Wilson are to headline on the main stage. The other groups are largely unknown to our posse. Some of them are made up entirely of early teens, so we assume that these must represent Bill's educational constituency. <p/> Whatever, this marks a definite \"step up\" in Wilson's local profile, and we have been working hard to make it a good one. <p/> First, however, there is the small matter of retrieving Kathy Schaer from the United States, where she has been visiting her family. At about one o'clock I receive a phone call from Kath. She is back in the country (hooray!), but there is a snag. Somebody has just thrown himself onto the railway line and all the trains back to Northampton have stopped. Honestly, it's just self-self-self for some people, isn't it? <p/> Fortunately enough, the railways sort themselves out for once and by five o'clock Kath is back in NN1 and ready to rumble. <p/> Stevie G and I are the first to arrive at the venue, where we meet James, our soundman for the night. As I go to shake his hand, he declares: \"You're famous!\" It turns out that he has heard endless reports about Stranger Tractors from the old Tractors didgeridoo player, Bolly, who went on to work as the bar manager at the venue. James also tells us to expect no more than a line-check before playing. Gently, calmly, firmly I explain to him that if he wants a full bill tonight, Wilson will be doing a full sound check. The message is received and, it would appear, understood. <p/> No sooner have we established this than Kath arrives at the venue, closely followed by Agent Cooper. While James organises a soundcheck for a band called Sophomore (who have a rather more...uh...traditional line-up than Wilson), we head for the car park to enjoy the balmy evening with some special cigarettes. We have not been there long before our attention is drawn to a car on the busy main road beneath us, which is emitting odd electronic squawks and bleeps. Somebody in the car has some kind of gimmicky loud-hailer device, which they are using to full effect down there in the Friday evening traffic. \"Nutter\", we conclude. <p/> A few moments later we hear the strange noises again. They turn out to be issuing from MC Bot, who is hanging out of the window of Curtis' car clutching a brightly coloured bullhorn. The party is about to kick off. <p/> In the corner of the car park we gather around Russ' motor, skinning up, hanging out and playing The Streets at maximum volume: as intimidating a gang of middle-aged sociopaths as you could hope to avoid. The other groups are arriving by now. Some of them are so young that they are being delivered in cars by fond fathers, who actually look about the right age to join Wilson. There is much amusement as one of the dads manhandles a huge speaker cabinet across the car park while The Streets chant \"Let's push things forward!\" <p/> A soundcheck is arranged and runs smoothly enough. I find myself more or less alone stage right. This gives me two major advantages: (i) I have plenty of space in which to operate, and (ii) I can crank my amp as loud as I want without putting anybody off their stroke. <p/> Soundcheck completed, MC Bot and Russ set out to find the dressing room, returning minutes later to advise us that there are to be no dressing rooms tonight. Given that the contract for tonight offers no rider, no guest list, no guaranteed wages and no dressing room, I wonder what exactly was the point of asking me to sign it. It's not as though there was anything on offer to sign for, after all. Still, we are not despondent. We smoke up and split up, heading off to feed. <p/> It is about half past seven as I leave the venue. I am astonished to see dozens and dozens of teens flooding into the front bar. Later, my pal's daughter will ask me \"What are all these children doing here?\" Right now, though, I am just glad to see that there is going to be an audience. (It later turns out that there were about 280 paying punters.) <p/> On my return from having a little dinner in The Fish, I am unable to find any of the band at the venue. Eventually I find Curtis and Stevie G. They have simply gone ahead and commandeered a dressing room regardless. Also in the dressing room is a harassed-looking gentleman in a suit, who, Curt tells me, is here to film the show. After a brief consultation with the venue staff he is allowed access to the balcony, where he spends the rest of the evening with his fingers in his ears. <p/> Also in the area are Jonny Mattock from Lupine Howl and Mark Refoy, freshly returned from his world tour playing guitar for the Pet Shop Boys. It's his first chance to catch Wilson live and we are pleased to see him. <p/> I watch a little bit of Sophomore; very strong traditional British \"indie\" played very loud indeed, with much head-shaking down in the front row of the punters. Very much Not My Thing, but expertly delivered and rightly popular with the youngsters. Passing into the front bar I see another band, a kind of rustic Oasis, fronted by a strangely-shaped young singer with even stranger sideburns. I have no idea what they were called, but they were quite entertaining all the same. <p/> Then it is time for the Bad Muthafuckas. After a brief introduction from Bill we go full-tilt into \"Quality People\" and boy, is it loud! There is a young man down the front lying flat-out on the floor. James the soundman sees him and comes rushing over, alarmed and ready to help. As he reaches the casualty, the boy just gets up, shrugs and walks away. Weird. <p/> The set rumbles on. We play well and make maximum use of the available space. At one point I look up to see Curtis, miles away from his instrument and his microphone, just leaping about in the middle of the stage. Bot is switching between his mic and his bullhorn according to some strange inner Bot Logic. Despite being jet-lagged to the point of utter bewilderment, Kath lays down huge basslines that enter your body through your feet. After the show Stevie G and I agree that we have never cranked our amps so loud. <p/> The set runs: Quality People; Yellow Pages; Burn Hollywood Burn; Hippy Shit (particularly rocking version tonight); Istanbul Connection; Play It All Night Long; Every Saturday Night; Critters; Dark Agenda. It is well received and, according to Kath McGinty, about the same volume as a jumbo jet taking off indoors. We have taken on the Roadmender and pulled it off. <p/> After the show a member of the Roadmender staff approaches us and asks us to support a band called Skindread on Saturday 12th October. Seeing this as our \"wages\" for the night, we say yes. So that was all worthwhile, then. <p/> On the other hand, as we leave the stage we discover that the bar has closed. This after we had been told that it would stay open until at least one o'clock. We resolve to pack up and head for the nearby Charles Bradlaugh, which stays open until one and which has recently taken to serving Pilsner Urquell. <p/> On the way out I find Bill being menaced by some tiny youths. Despite presumably having had the same mealy-mouthed contract as ourselves, they are demanding to be paid. Things turn comically ugly as one tiny youth advises Bill that he is going to set the \"Music Union\" (sic) onto poor Bill. This does seem a touch unlikely. If this tiny youth is in the Musicians' Union, then I am Marie of Romania. <p/> We pass a pleasant hour or so in the Bradlaugh before taking off. Kath is going home for some long-overdue rest. Russ and Curt also head for home. The rest of us have a brief after-show back at Shakespeare Mansions. Mindful of our gig tomorrow, we turn in around four o'clock."},{"gigtext_id":433,"datetime":"2002-09-21","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"We didn't advertise it coz it was essentially a birthday party for an expat Northamptonian."},{"gigtext_id":434,"datetime":"2002-09-21","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Well, the weekend was mental. As you know, we did the Roadmender on Friday night. What you probably didn't know about was the Wilson Vietnam trip to Wales yesterday. We didn't advertise it coz it was essentially a birthday party for an expat Northamptonian. Plus nobody would tell us the name of the farm where it was taking place! Still, we found the fecker and rocked the shed fully. Full reports (featuring The Face O' Death) to follow. <h1>Saturday 21st September - BUILTH WELLS </h1> It is eleven thirty on a beautiful, sunny Saturday morning in the car park of the Racehorse. Members of Wilson and P-Hex are gathering, ready for the 150 mile trip to Builth Wells in the heart of Wales. Cars are filled with equipment as people sip odd non-alcoholic drinks. Kathie McGinty and I are travelling in our Fiat Uno with a bunch of equipment. Russ is taking Kath Schaer, Curtis and Bot are travelling with Steve Davies, Lindsay Spence (the singer from P-Hex) and Nathan from Junior Loaded in a car dubbed \"The Zoo\", and Stevie G is travelling with P-Hex. At about midday the first car of the convoy sets off. <p/> We are headed for a farm which Alan Moore bought back in the Nineties, which has been home to his pal Fred Ryan for several years now. Today is the occasion of Fred's fiftieth birthday and a massive party has been planned. Apart from the groups, there are several dozen Northampton people heading west today. <p/> Thoughtfully, nobody has been told the name of the farm in question. Our instructions are to find a bar in Builth called The White Hart and ask for \"Fred's farm\". Fortunately enough, P-Hex have done this gig before, so we still entertain hopes of finding the place. <p/> Once we get west of Worcester the roads grow narrow and the houses more ancient and picturesque. Every other village gets me going \"Oh, eccentric life here, isn't it?\" in the manner of Turkish George. It is barely recognisable as the same country as Northampton. Just west of a place called Kington we pass through an intimidating gorge into Welsh Wales. Well, at least now it really is a different country. <p/> The first thing we see as we cross the River Wye into Builth is Kath and her boyfriend Jay standing outside our hotel. The Lion Hotel boasts a George Best bar and a Lady Diana restaurant, as well as a splendid African Grey parrot who shouts \"Wanker!\" We check into our rooms, which are much more comfortable than the dilapidated public areas of the hotel would suggest. Ours has a fantasticview out over the river. We stroll up the picturesque main street to the White Hart for directions and a pint, then hit the local supermarket for supplies. On our way out of the supermarket we are passed by The Zoo, with Bot hanging out of the window, making maximum use of his bullhorn: \"Wilson in the area! Pat Fish in the area!\" he broadcasts as the car disappears up the high street, \"Whoop! Squawk! Bleep!\" <p/> The farm is not easy to find, and we make one or two false landings among bewildered locals before finally locating our objective at the end of an obscure and lengthy country lane. We pull into the parking and camping field just in time to see the local Police helicopter circling overhead, attracting all kinds of long-distance abuse. <p/> The Zoo is promptly converted into a giant ghetto blaster and The Streets are on once again. People are wandering about grinning and greeting as NN1 comes to the deep countryside. Tents are going up, dogs are chasing sticks and children are getting dressed up in ludicrous costumes. One small boy of about eight is wearing a push-up bra and make-up. More alarmingly, another tiny is sporting a terrifying skull mask, which leads to his immediately being dubbed The Face Of Death. <p/> Almost immediately The Face Of Death and MC Bot become entangled in a mortal struggle. The tiny demon follows Bot everywhere like some superhero's sidekick gone horribly wrong, and it is not long before things get gnarly. One small child is overheard telling his mother: \"This man is chasing us, like, well badly!\" <p/> Later, alarmingly, other, adult Faces Of Death turn up. Fortunately they do not seek retribution from our singer. In addition, there are nuns, pirates, monks and a man in a fez with what I can only describe as two faces. \"Now that,\" I tell him, \"Is just plain scary.\" Though not, perhaps, as scary as the old friend of Curtis who has turned up with a full-size, razor-sharp Samurai sword. <p/> Curtis himself rapidly becomes a casualty of the fancy dress tendency. After being on site for only ten minutes he re-appears with his baldy head painted red and blue. Since this has been accomplished using car spray paint, he remains something of an odd apparition for the rest of the weekend. <p/> The farm itself is made up of three buildings: one entirely residential, one devoted to catering and one, a large barn, the music venue. There are Muscovy ducks waddling around the farmyard and many goats in an enclosure just nearby. I strike up what I like to consider a strong and lasting relationship with the Head Goat (\"el gran cabro numero uno mas importante\", I call him). Somebody then points out that perhaps we should not get too attached. There is a large goat skin hanging up to dry on a metal frame and curried goat on tonight's menu. <p/> Later, when I try to get fed, I discover that the choice of dining is restricted to this goat curry and a ferocious chilli con carne. Not fancying a dinner of cold white rice, I take solace in a dinner of liquorice allsorts before taking steps to ensure that I shall not think of food again. Thanks, lads. <p/> There is an endless wait for soundchecks, as nobody seems to have any clue as to what is going on. As well as Wilson and P-Hex, two local bands have been booked to play, and neither has been spotted yet. In the end, we settle for just checking the DAT player with the soundman, figuring that as long as this is reliable we can turn in a set. Then we amuse ourselves drinking, smoking and checking out the two large bonfires that have been started. <p/> Eventually the first band appears. They are all a little bit older than us, and they are a classic festival jamming band. Although they are not my thing at all, they seem quite well suited to the event. I begin to wonder if we really ought to be playing here, and entertain fantasies of clearing the barn altogether when our turn to play comes around. Not that I am really bothered whether we get to play or not, for I am having a perfectly good time already. <p/> Others do not take so well to Band No. 1. Certain elements of the NN1 posse start popping over to the soundman, telling him to put a stop to this degenerate hippy nonsense. Happily Band No. 1 draws its increasingly tedious set to a close without any coercion. <p/> Band No. 2 are young and have a broken axle from trying to get to the farm. The good news is that this means that they can use the same drum kit as Band No. 1. The bad news is that they play a set made up entirely of old rock covers, Jimi Hendrix and the like. Again, I worry that the Wilson sound might be that little bit...uh...unsuitable for the night. After all, this is a fiftieth birthday party in the middle of nowhere. Stevie G, however, tells me not to worry. \"Someone has to get a-hold of this thing and turn the vibe around,\" he tells me, \"I know I can do it...\" There is, I feel, a certain ring of desperation about his remark. <p/> The sun is down, the bonfires are raging, people are milling about in mad costumes, fuelled by drink, curry goat and God-knows what else. I think back to Sumosonic's doomed and foolhardy trip to Melchbourne in 1998, a date we dubbed Sumo Vietnam and which turned out to be our last ever gig. Have we been and gone and done it again? Are we facing Wilson Vietnam? <p/> Now, as I have come to understand the situation, we shall be taking the Band No. 3 slot, with P-Hex topping the bill. But as the Queens Of The Stone Age do sonic battle with the KLF in the Wilson ghetto, Stevie G arrives to say that P-Hex are in disarray. Their drummer has taken a dislike to the situation and is agitating to get back to Northampton as quickly as possible. So P-Hex are now going to take the Band No. 3 slot and we are to move to the top of the bill. Oh Christ! At least P-Hex have played here before and gone down well. Whereas we have absolutely no idea what to expect. <p/> P-Hex take the stage and are sounding strong. Whatever the emotional state of their drummer, he is playing hard and grinning from ear to ear. The barn is full of punters and the atmosphere really is picking up. The Reverend Lindsay rocks the house in his own special style and new vocalist Fiona is doing well. Stevie G can be seen, stage right, holding his guitar above his head and going mental. <p/> Once P-Hex are done there is a burst of activity as Wilson move their stuff onto the stage. It is now that I make a nasty discovery. The floor of the barn, it turns out, has recently been concreted, and there is still a huge amount of dust everywhere. By the time I am set up, my leads have turned colour from black to white and there is a fine sand all over my guitars. And all over me. <p/> As Quality People starts up, MC Bot is nowhere to be seen. In fact, he is standing by one of the bonfires, minding his own business. He suddenly comes barging into the barn, scattering punters, just in time to pick up the first line of the song! Despite the lack of a soundcheck, the band sounds great. Many thanks to Steve Ward for his work at the controls, and to the local soundmen for having such a good rig. <p/> There is not a whole lot of space on the stage here and I am under constant threat from our hyperactive lead singer. Imagine, therefore, my disquiet when, two songs into the set, Bot demands: \"Where are my dancers?\" Before I know it we are joined on stage by three Welsh girls in belly dancers' costumes! My pedals don't stand a chance: by the end of \"Burn Hollywood Burn\" my phaser is literally standing on its head. But we press on and \"Hippy Shit\" rocks the shack large-style. The punters are going Edgar Wallace Donuts. All my anxieties have been in vain. The barn is heaving and these fuckers are going for it in a big way. <p/> As we move into Critters I find myself standing unsteadily on one of the monitors. Curtis' pal with the sword is now onstage, trying to feed joints to the musicians. Because of the lack of space and the frenetic activity he is surprisingly unsuccessful in this. He resorts to firing off blowbacks, but even this is an inexact science in the onstage chaos. By the fiery ending of Dark Agenda he is simply taking a huge lungful and running up to people and French kissing them. It is, I can honestly say, the first time that I have been French kissed by a man while playing a guitar solo. Anywhere. The general reaction among the NN1 posse, as expressed by Kathie McGinty: \"How gay was that?\" <p/> Dark Agenda goes down in a blaze of noise, which somehow mutates into a spirited acapella \"Happy Birthday\" for Fred. The vibe is grand. It's time to pack up our filthy equipment and grab another beer. <p/> By the time we have packed up, it turns out that the P-Hex wagon has already set off back to Northampton with the dissident drummer on board, leaving Stevie G stranded without a ride. An hour or two goes by as we try to locate taxis to take us back to the hotel. Despite Fred's assurances that the local firms have been primed for our call, it is by now 3:00 am and we get nowhere. Stevie G curls up and goes to sleep in the back of The Zoo. Eventually, after some fairly agonised soul-searching and a swordsmanship exhibition from Curt's pal, we set off in a very slow convoy through the mist, making it back to the hotel a tense but uneventful fifteen minutes later. Curtis takes his newly colourful head to bed, and Kath, still jet-lagged does the same. For the rest of us it's the usual beer and smoke party at the hotel. Against all the odds we have come and done the shit. We decide two things: (i) we are some bad muthafuckas, and (ii) it has definitely been an away win. <p/> Men Of The Match (so to speak): Kathy Schaer for perseverance beyond the call of jetlag. Stevie G for organising the Wales trip and playing 2 sets in a single night."},{"gigtext_id":428,"datetime":"2002-10-12","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"As a result of the mmmm...severity of our <a href=\"/gigs/2002/Sep20.html\">Roadmender engagement</a> we managed to pick up another date there.

The first thing we notice on arriving at the Roadmender is that we now have a dressing room, with our name on the door and a crate of beers inside it. When Brian, our social secretary, appears we have all we need in this small and airless HQ of ours. Steve Ward is here to mix us tonight, and that means that we have a fine and easy soundcheck. Wilson in the comfort zone. Stepping out to the bar I find Simon Mawby (Woodentops guitarist) and June Miles-Kingston (drummer to Fun Boy Three and other gentry). Pleased as I am to see them here, I can't help wondering what the man once known as Cardinal Mawb will make of all this. <p/> I am still in the bar when I hear the sounds of The Streets. Time to head for the dressing room and get ready, then... <p/> We go on at about 8:30. The main hall of the Roadmender is about two thirds full. The vast majority of the audience is staggeringly young. Well, stand by to be screamed at by people the age of your parents, The Kids... <p/> Curtis is in Amsterdam for his brother's stag night, the lucky dog, so it falls to me to do a bit of avant-gardening with my delay pedal. Swooshie-wooshie it goes as Quality People stutters into life. Bang thump crunch goes the group as MC Bot emerges, statuesque, all in red, still clutching that bloody bullhorn thing and looking for a rumble. We go tearing through our first tune as the room fills up. They're hanging over the barriers at the front and the heads are beginning to shake. <p/> Yellow Pages (as we're still calling it) is feeling fully-formed now and with a superb sound onstage and off we are able to deliver it in fine style. Then a fiery Burn Hollywood Burn (well, it would be, wouldn't it?) gets things really going. <p/> Hippy Shit next, with Bot and me working overtime in the vocal department. Russell's solo spot is swamped in white noise, which may have something to do with me. Whatever, the house is rocked. A little chill with Istanbul Connection, then Every Saturday Night, another new song that's found its feet. I find myself wondering what Simon must be thinking. It can't possibly be what he was expecting. <p/> We rip up Play It All Night Long, then throw Critters at them. It's explosive. People are standing on the PA columns. Critters crashes into great wall of controlled feedback before the nagging Dark Agenda riff emerges. Another top version: the end section sees everybody going Edgar Wallace mental, Bot booming out New Order lyrics over the chaos. The punters erupt and I leave the stage to the sound of Bot haranguing them about I know not what. And it's no good asking him what he was on about, coz he can't remember! Truly the best set we have yet delivered: totally convincing sound, furious performance, baying punters. Just what you want. <p/> After a few minutes chilling back in the dressing room we check Skindred. Boy, are they loud! It's the rock/dub thing, as you might expect from a band that was formed from the ashes of Dub War. Rage Against The Machine might be a suitable point of reference. They are a top live band and go down well, teasing the audience before returning for a well-earned encore. Nice geezers too. They're Welsh, you know. <p/> We pack up our kit and have another brief chat with Simon and June before it is time for another Wilson novelty - getting paid! With the paper stuff securely stuffed into our pockets we head for Stevie G's new house for a buffalo vodka knees-up. <p/> Dark Agenda - do you need an explanation?"},{"gigtext_id":430,"datetime":"2002-10-26","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"We didn't advertise it, for it was a private party.

Every time we play Leeds on a Friday we are confronted with the Wankers' Parade, proof positive that a transport system reliant almost entirely upon private cars is already discredited, doomed, dull, dirty, dreary and shat. On occasions too many to number traffic on the M1 would slow to a crawl, grind along for twenty minutes and then dissolve into perfectly regular traffic once again, without there ever being any indication whatsoever as to the cause of the blockage. One driver per vehicle, of course, over and over again. Very important people. They'd tell you so themselves if they weren't already on the phone to somebody else almost as important as themselves. <p/> From Northampton NN1 to Leeds LS6 (you can get tee-shirts with their postcode on too now, I noticed), a distance of some 180 miles, took us four and a half hours. No roadworks. No accidents. Just the Wankers' Parade. Rat-a-tat. <p/> Still, Don't write a song about it. <p/> Rich Morris and Disco Stu have gone for it this time. Two separate stages in the large-ish Brudenell Cheap Beer Club, five separate acts and an M.C. We've not been in Leeds long before things get underway with an earnest fellow with a laptop. It was a bit unfair of the compere to let on that the poor fellow was really playing Solitaire while a dodgy old drum n bass tape played in the background. To be honest, though, he really might as well have done that. How would anybody have known? Except it wasn't drum n bass - it was avant-bleepy Octopus Records 1997 sort of stuff. Two numbers and he was gone. Then the deeply culturally significant, dapper and generally swell D. Millard did his thing. He scared elements among the swelling crowd of punters and came across loud and clear, thank you very much indeed. Why is he not famous? We must make it so. <p/> Thing is...when you're watching D. Millard screaming \"Religion OOOOUUUUUTTTT!!!!\" at people over a tinny eccentrically-tuned guitar, you're pretty much tempted to ask yourself, or a nearby punter. Well, how mental is that, then? As it turned out, tonight, it would register as well, only a bit mental. But next, before there was time even to think of food, it was Wilson. Or \"Mister Wilson\", as we were so amusingly introduced by the M.C. We played the same set as at the Labour Club. I believe that the sound in the room was significantly better than what some of us were hearing at the time. It's not unusual. It didn't feel like we really caught fire (we could all hear ourselves, but you need to hear what everyone is doing before you can really get into something.) Still, no horrors, and good, solid versions of everything, well received. Our last tune, which seems to be called Buffalo Sniper or something now, on only its second outing, turned really evil. It was like Neil Young or something, but with horrid speed-garage blighters shouting \"HIT HIM AGAIN!\" over the top. One of those huge feedback pile-ups to close and we're done. An away draw, shall we say, although I might be being hard on the band there. Later, as I searched for the cigarette machine, two young teen girls stopped me and told me that we were their favourite band of the night. \"G'night, Mister Wilson,\" they called. Curse that Diamond Jim! <p/> Then things went a bit strange for a while. You know how some bands have exactly the right name? How they really couldn't be called anything else but that? Conjurer of Monikers stuff - inevitable, axiomatic and unchangeable. Hey, kids. Permit me to present: The Unpleasants. <p/> I don't know if I'm equal to the task of describing this act. I understand that it's really a member of the highly-regarded northern indie combo Hood. having a bit of a laugh on his nights off. Straight away, might I just suggest to Hood's agent (in the slim hope that he might read these thoughts) that he should be getting the band a lot more work. The Devil makes work for idle hands, even for folks in indie bands. That almost rhymes, that does. (Stick with me...if you're beginning to feel a touch irritated at the tone, please bear with it. It's my effort to give a feeling of what it was like to be there.) <p/> A man in a farmer's suit and flat cap sits at an electronic keyboard. He is wearing a ludicrous false beard. On the keyboard sits a monkey. Yes, a monkey. They talk to each other. It's like Keith Harris and Orville gone horribly, bickeringly, unpleasantly wrong. In between their little chats, the farmer and the monkey play this...music... that sounds like what might happen if Richard Formby accidentally blew up a science laboratory and went hopelessly, irredeemably mad. Kids, this is not Tom Waits noodling around coz the piano's been drinking, not him. No, Virginia, this is hideously well-organised, cheesy northern English...music and it's wrong, boys and girls, it's deeply, deeply wrong. And there's a monkey. <p/> In my innocence, I imagined that the farmer was taking advantage of his beard disguise to do the talking on the monkey's behalf as well. Admittedly, he seemed to have the exchanges down to a fine art, but - hey! - if you're going to be good at something, eh, son? But no, it was so much worse than that. There was another man - concealed about the back end of the club with a microphone - doing the monkey's bit. This intelligence caused my brain to explode. Oh God, people, if you could just hear their ghastly music. People say it was the monkey. The monkey was cack, sure. But, oh, God help me, it was the music. The horrible, horrible, English music. Make it stop, oh, please, please make it stop... <p/> We had heard that Sammy USA were highly-regarded round these parts, and liable to sign some kinda deal in the next three quarters of an hour or so. In geological time, anyway. Five-piece traditional indie band. Madonna on keyboards (dressed down for the occasion), Monkey (Great King, Equal of Heaven) on lead guitar, Rufus and Doofus on drums and bass (indie sprawl, plod, splatter, plop) and some fey southern youth singing and playing guitar. \"You can't act like you created the stars, it's not right\" was their lyric (their enormous entourage will probably now have me arrested for daring to print their lyrics without permission. Swivel.) sung to a very pretty melody. It helped that Madonna consented to adding a bit of backing vocal at this point. (I've heard she's all right on the consent thing.) And, errrrm...that was it. It churned on and on, self-regarding and self-pitying. Pack of bedwetters. I'm sure they'll do well. Rat-a-tat. <p/> But, hang on - the name thing : I mean, for Christ's sake - \"Sammy USA\" - surely, if anything means anything at all in this meretricious, facile shop-window of a world, then might we not count on a name like that to offer the prospect of some good old electricity, excitement, danger? Irony even, if you must. For a UK band even to have the letters \"USA\" in their name at this moment in \"history\" (Hey, gang? Remember when History wuz Dead? Me too! Francis Fukuyama - crazy name, crazy guy!) should surely be some kind of signifier? Or (may I quote En Vogue here?) WHY EVEN BOTHER? Call yourselves the Richard and the Judies or something, if all you're going to write about is your piss-poor, rather short life in a suburb in Hertfordshire. Most importantly, just Get the Fuck Outta My Face, You Can't Afford It. Me Courtney, you Hollyoaks. Whenever you're ready, lads... <p/> (PS - Madonna - dump these puddingy losers now. We all know you've still got it in you, love.) <p/> Errrm, yes. Well there it is. Good band, bit like Blur. Excuse me a minute... <p/> Back to Richard's, where we were royally paid and fed pizzas that tasted of carrots. It's just plain weird up north. <p/> Leeds footnote: They're not all nutters.

They eventually finished with a ferocious cover of \"These Boots Are Made for Walking\", while Pig Unit and Wilson shuffled around nervously, wondering how the hell they were supposed to squeeze their sets into the sixty minutes that remained before closing time. <p/> Credit to the Pig Unit boys, who showed immense courtesy in cutting short their set, especially in the light of the fact that several dozen people were going entirely mental apeshit at their every move. It's a heavy rap-rock sound that they make, but they are probably rather more enticing than that makes them sound. Just one quibble - couldn't they change their name to Pigs Unite? Or even Pigs United? (Pig City? - sounds like an Iggy bootleg...) (Pigs Villa - now you're just being silly...) <p/> Wilson made it to the stage at about 10:45pm. A number of the players were quite wound up, something that was immediately apparent as we kicked off with a newly beefed-up Police Chief. Possibly because there had been a drum kit there before, the stage seemed unusually spacious. I remembered all the shite European rock bands that I had seen on TV shows over there, who always seemed to have a moment when the long-haired guitar nutter suddenly runs out to the front, stuffs his foot on a monitor and gurns madly as the only audible bit of guitar on the whole record suddenly blurts out from the whirring of massed eighties synthesisers. And that's what I did. Later on, for reasons to do with getting over-excited, I did the James Brown thing and fell down flat on my back mid-solo. Misery and Russ later expressed some concern about my physical wellbeing. When I revealed that I'd meant to do that, their concern switched to my mental condition. Stevie G was a rock god (great equal of heaven, why do you not grow sideburns?) and there was enthusiastic shouting all round. <p/> Unable to do anything about the fact that the bar was on the brink of closing, we ploughed on, and incredibly the audience stayed with us. Complete strangers were dancing down the front. Somebody called us \"Mental Mondays\" and bought some records. Things were looking up. <p/> Altogether, we had gone into this night quite confident. Then we ran into all kinds of unexpected technical difficulties at soundcheck and found ourselves pushed back into some desperate post-drinking graveyard shift, to the point where that confidence was almost entirely dissipated, but STILL we managed to come up smelling of the finest Morroccan. Mental middle-aged sociopath crew makes desperate last stand, achieves last minute home win. The crowd goes mad. Well, Lindsey does anyway. <p/> We bludgeon the Buffalo Sniper to death, and as the last howls of feedback fade away a piano rings out through the P.A.

We laid on a rehearsal while he was here so that he could get a flavour of the Wilson thing, and it actually turned into something of a private gig. Much fun. Cole duly set off for a cycling tour around Tuscany (oh, he's fit for his years) and we set about preparing for our return to the Soundhaus, report below: <p/> We hadn't played the Soundhaus since our very first show, so it was pleasing to get the invitation to come and play there again. <p/> The evening took an early turn for the weird while we were still soundchecking, when we lost Mr. E. Wilson after some chronic misunderstanding with the local promoter in re. beer. He had managed to get hold of the wrong end of a number of sticks, but it had all made him so angry that he just packed up and legged it. The soundcheck passed without further drama and we repaired, along with sonic technician Stevie Ward, to Shakespeare Villas to watch England's game against Slovakia. <p/> At half-time England were trailing by a goal to nil, but we had to set off and do our thing. After a pleasant stroll round to the venue we went in to find the first band, Ambience, already on stage. The audience? Oh, we were the audience. By the time we took to the stage (announced by MC Bot as \"the Wilson Five\") a few brave souls had abandoned their tellies and showed up to watch. What they got for their trouble was a 30 minute blast of guitar-heaviness, with Stevie G. on record-breaking form.MC Bot was probably fortunate that the place wasn't too busy: otherwise his persistent shouts of \"GAY BAR!!!\" might have been misunderstood. But hey - we were always going to like the Electric Six. They are our kind of people having fun. <p/> The audience was small but appreciative and the set rushed by, hitting the wall at the end of Buffalo Sniper with a mighty slap, while maniacal laughter rang out through the feedback. No time for mutual fan-club action, though, for we had to clear our shit away to make room for the headliners, an agreeable quartet from Nottingham called Fin. Their style is a bit all-over-the-place, but they play very well and Jamie, their singer, definitely has the looks and the charisma for the job. We got on well with them, for they had seen our set and declared it \"f***ing brilliant\". <p/> Afterwards we walked our kit round to Misery's place, just a hundred yards (eighty metres, Euroreaders) from the venue, before heading back to Shakespeare Villas to party with Johnny P and Will Carruthers, who were over from Rugby Town, and to listen to the new album from British Sea Power (it's the last track you want - all 15 minutes of the fecker!). Will was on top form, winding up everybody in sight. It being midweek, we shut down at around half past two after a very pleasant evening. <p/> Oh, and England came good in the second half, with two goals from Michael Owen bringing in the essential three points. <p/> The Stone <br/>xxx"},{"gigtext_id":446,"datetime":"2003-07-05","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Eider and I have been secured to play a wedding...in Northampton!

They had cheerfully ignored his suggestions that a trip to Turkey starting on Monday might be just the ticket. Instead, they booked him onto a holiday trip that departed on Saturday morning. Steve only discovered this on Friday evening, and to be fair, he came straight and told the other members of the band that he was suddenly and unexpectedly out of the starting line-up for Sunday's gig. Naturally, we abused him luxuriously and left him to his fate. For the clueless flatmates had not booked Steve a nice trip to Turkey. Oh no. Our poor guitarist found himself gazing straight down the barrel of a full ten days in a compulsory-sex-and-throwing-up gulag in Ibiza! Somebody pointed out that it makes Guantanamo Bay seem like quite an attractive distination. <p/> Faintly rattled, the remaining quintet pulled together a rehearsal on Saturday night, a lengthy but relaxed affair, enlivened by calls of \"Sack the bald bloke!\" from a passing Sonic Boom. The few pals in attendance declared that we appeared perfectly match-fit as a quintet, and we felt all right. <p/> Now, about Magic Skool Bus... It has crossed our minds that maybe they were winding us up. If so, they deserve some kind of award. UK readers will be only too aware that pubs close at half past ten of a Sunday. We had organised a three band bill, which really was all that there was time for. Over the weekend, the drummer of Magic Skool Bus, one Rory by name, advised us first that there was to be a fourth band on the bill, then - at the soundcheck - that a FIFTH ensemble was on its way to join in the fun! Frankly, I couldn't see how on earth Rory was going to get four bands on and off the stage in time for us to get on at ten o'clock. <p/> We decided that it was probably for the best if we just let Rory and his pals get on with doing whatever they were going to do, so after a quick and easy soundcheck we quit the theatre of operations and kept out of the way. <p/> At about eight thirty I stuck my head around the door of the venue. Small herds of teens milled across the dance floor while Victims of the Establishment did their punk rock thing. Damn fine it was too. V.O.T.E. seem to have taken on that Wilson thing of having three big blokes yelling at you all at the same time, and it worked well. They looked good, they sounded good and by golly it did me good. After a couple of tunes I headed back to the front bar to join the growing pack of friends and mentallists assembling to see my band. Johnny Octopus and his girlfriend had come up from London, and we were also graced with a visit from a gentleman who worked on the British Mars probe that just blasted off the other day. I don't think I've ever met a man who had launched a space ship before. (Or does Kizzy O'Callaghan count?) <p/> A few beers later, I popped my head around the door again, and was delighted to find Magic Skool Bus taking the stage. This band is very mad. They play ska-punk music, with a three piece horn section. They play very fast indeed. The teens were digging it like good 'uns. I was just happy that MSB had made it onstage in time. <p/> When it came time for The Bus to leave the stage I grabbed Rory: \"Congratulations, mate. I don't know how you did it, but we're bang on time.\" He replied: \"Well, the fact that two of the bands didn't show up might have helped...\" <p/> So there we have it. Three bands, just like it said on the posters. So what was it? Were there really two mystery bands who just failed to show up? Or was it all just the Wind-Up Of The Week? We here at Planet Wilson STILL don't know! <p/> Around about ten o'clock, then, we got up. And from the very beginning we knew we were going to be having a bit of a night. The crowd had swelled by now, with many of the usual suspects in the area and bent on mayhem. This being the case, we thought that maybe we should deliver them of exactly that - mayhem. And that, dear readers, is what they got. With Steve safely locked away in the fleshpots of San Antonio, I turned up the amplifier and went for it. <p/> Curtis was on fine form too. In addition to his Air-FX machine, he is now also the proud owner of an Air-Synth. Not that you would know: he has taken to concealing all his technology in a small box draped in black fabrics. There was some talk about maybe printing something on the box. My favourite suggestion was: \"CASSETTE PLAYER\". The sound was good and strong, with Misery laying down rock-hard bass. As the set went on, Skinner began to drop delays and effects into the mix. We gave it some forty minutes, detonated the last chord of Dark Agenda with some first-class sonic Semtex, and split, leaving the happy punters bellowing for more through the feedback. I can't say for certain, of course, but it felt as if we had just hit a new level altogether. As Mr. Cotton put it, \"A stunning performance , I realise that you felt you were on the brink of relegation , but I think you went on to Win The Cup.\" <p/> Mr. Cotton is also responsible for the accompanying screen dump. God bless him! <p/> Records and shirts were sold. Money changed hands. MC Bot (who had a blinder himself, by the way) appeared with a case of Becks Bier. We jumped into Steve Ward's jet-black A-Team stealth van and vanished into the NN1 night. <p/> When I went into Deepak's shop this morning, he said \"I hear you had a good gig last night.\" Bloody hell, if people are volunteering glowing reviews of our shows to their local shopkeepers, we must be doing something right. <p/> Oh, and I heard it was raining in Ibiza...saucer of milk for Number 77 please... <p/> Headstone NN1 28/7/2003"},{"gigtext_id":438,"datetime":"2003-08-23","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"We shall return to Builth Wells in Wales for a 6 band extravaganza on Saturday 23rd August.

It was a memorable evening, but the members of the posse who don't eat meat did have one small problem, what with curried goat being the dish of the day. Your correspondent had a whale of a time on a diet of Liquorice Allsorts, as it goes. <p/> So it was that this August the corner shops of NN1 were systematically stripped of Mrs. McCartney's sausages and Soylent-Green-Burgers by shadowy, black-clad marginals. Instant barbecue kits were purchased from supermarkets - along with jars of olives, jars of sun-dried peppers, multiple dips, hummus, pitta bread, buns, chocolate. Somebody has packed a vegetable grater. By the time that Saturday comes, one thing is clear: the veggie faction is not going to be caught out this year, no sir. <p/> Something else is to be different this year; the hotel where we stayed last time has closed down while a new owner tries to make sense of it. This time it's to be camping. <p/> Early on a sunny Saturday afternoon the convoy sets off from the Racehorse. Kathie and I find ourselves travelling with the estimable Mr. Cotton and Sarah. We stop to loot Oddbins of its Budvar and Urquell, then, intending to avoid bank holiday motorway hell, we take to the back roads: Builth the pretty way. Huge farm carts piled with hay rumble along in front of us at ten miles an hour. We play The Bad Seeds and the Electric Six as we negotiate strange, obscure country villages, some of which appear to have been occupied by stealth by the Freedom - sorry, The French. In Leominster deeply tranquillised pedestrians wander heedlessly beneath our wheels. <p/> We reach Builth in the lovely early evening sun. As we drive up the high street we see Stevie Ward's A-Team bus parked up, MC Bot hanging out of the passenger seat window with his bullhorn, yelling \"Wilson in the area!\" just like he did 11 months ago. Builth Wells' picturesque little high street is heaving with people from Northampton. <p/> After a few fraught minutes in the Hinterland, we once again find the lane that leads to the party's secret secure location. We arrive to find that a small camp has already sprung up in a far corner of the field and here we join Russ and Nita, Misery, Mister E. Wilson, Stevie G, Stevie Ward and his band. Tents go up, a fire pit is cleared for the barbie, the Budvar crate takes a hammering. MC Bot bestrides the hillside with his bullhorn. <p/> Witness the birth of NN109. <p/> Across the field, resplendent under their gazebo in the evening light, sit the citizens of The High Chaparral, Jamie Jab and his crew of mentallists. Relations between the twin settlements will be warm and increasingly incoherent as the evening wears on. <p/> The entertainment is nothing like what we had been led to expect. No Welsh bands are taking part this year, and a PA has only just been secured. That leaves only us and the debut performance from Stevie Ward's new band, Good Cop Bad Cop. There are many members of P-Hex in the area (well, in the field, I should say), but they are light of a drummer. Stevie G makes a brave attempt to persuade Mr. Cotton to play the drums, but Mr. Cotton is confused, thinking that Steve is referring to Wilson's set. \"Have you cleared this mad idea with Pat?\" he asks. \"I don't have to,\" replies Steve bafflingly. <p/> There is also the inconvenient fact that Mr. Cotton is actually a guitarist, not a drummer at all. <p/> So in the end we explain to the frightened-looking young lads with the PA that they only have two bands to worry about. Kit is set up and sound is checked. The courtyard is crowded with happy people eating barbecued goat. We leg it back to NN109 for the first hot food of the evening. <p/> As night sets in there are amazing views of the stars. You can see the Milky Way clearly. \"I can see why the Egyptians saw it as a mirror image of the Nile,\" I venture, and promptly fall into a hole. If you're lucky with the clouds, you can see Mars, as close as it has been to our Earth since the days when Neanderthals roamed the hillsides, making their camps, lighting their fires, cooking their food and singing their songs. <p/> ASTERRRRROOOOOID! COMING IN FROM THE VOID! <p/> As the awesome sounds of the new Killing Joke album split the air, the entire sky clouds over. What can it mean? My utility belt tells me \"To the barn, Batman.\" <p/> Good Cop Bad Cop are heavy. A mean metal three-piece. There are great tunes in there, but the PA boys have got things so cranked that it's not always easy to tell from inside the barn: the band actually sound better from about 40 yards away. Still, it's a fine first gig for them. Their drummer is quite something, a definite touch of the Grohls in there. <p/> MC Bot takes to the decks, banging out Primal Scream, The Streets, Wepunex, The Prodigy and Killing Joke. We wire ourselves up, ready to go. Then it's time. It takes a moment to get the DAT up and running, but soon the barn is echoing to the sound of Tim Leary and his psychedelic sheep. <p/> We start with a new, toughened-up version of God's Green Earth before diving headlong into the Hippy Shit. The monitors are fairly screaming at us onstage, but out front it's a clear, bass-heavy sound, with Misery taking full advantage of Good Cop Bad Cop's excellent bass rig (thanks, Alex!). She plays a blinder and the band feels great, we're flying. The set: <p/> GOD'S GREEN EARTH - HIPPY SHIT - SWEET HOME ALABAMA - BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN - ISTANBUL CONNECTION - CRITTERS - SECRET GOVERNMENT - EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT - POLICE CHIEF - QUALITY PEOPLE - YELLOW PAGES - BUFFALO SNIPER - DARK AGENDA. <p/> As we start into Yellow Pages I realise that my microphone has gone totally dead. In a mad panic, I seize Bot's mic and shout my way back on board. It ain't pretty, but it works. Confusing, though - why should it just go down like that? Bizarrely, at the end of the song I get my mic back. Life goes on, but then, just as Buffalo Sniper should be gathering force and steaming out of the breakdown, something really spectacular happens. For the first time ever at a gig we find ourselves without any kind of backing track. We're just running on our own momentum. Fascinating - no time to think about it: we adopt a kind of chug, hold our nerve and eventually rejoin the backing track as it mysteriously resurfaces towards the end of the tune. Dark Agenda goes off all right, featuring a chant of \"No techno! No techno!\" and an even more out-of-control finish than usual. I leave my Telecaster feeding back in a pile of rubble at the side of the stage and run out of the barn. I stand in the courtyard for a minute or two, listening to the sheets of filthy noise issuing forth. Then I run back in though another door, to find MC Bot crouched over my effects, making mayhem. We escape with our lives. <p/> Even as we start to pack up, the techno begins. Out in the little yard in front of the barn some eight or ten youths have gathered. They play the deepest, darkest, dumbest techno at the loudest volume and set about getting silently, wholly monged. We make a surprisingly efficient job of stowing our kit and flee the area. <p/> Back at NN109 I'm talking about the weird way that the top quality, super-loud PA just suddenly went completely random on us towards the end of the set. That's when somebody explains about the techno lads. Towards the end of the set they came into the back of the barn (like I'd notice. I'm a fecking guitar scientist, me. I'm lucky if I notice anything back there) and started taking the record decks and their attendant electronic shit out into the little yard. In so doing, apparently, they managed to unplug loads of wires that had nothing to do with the disco set-up, but everything to do with our disappearing drum loops. <p/> I have to say that my first reaction to this intelligence is to want to go and batter the wotless youths within an inch of terminal oblivion. Happily, better living through advanced biochemistry is achieved and I come to take the broader view. Clarity, Simon, that's the main thing. With understanding comes forbearance. With half-litre bottles of Budvar come custom cigarettes and sausages in buns. <p/> For hours people gather around the barbie, drink, smoke, speculate, celebrate the footie results. The techno never lets up. Boom! Boom! Boom! There is ill-advised cooking. Stevie D appears to freeze like a statue, completely motionless out there in the night. Then, as Stevie G goes to investigate, he drops like a felled tree. Into the car he goes. 'Night, Steve. <p/> Daylight comes. Profoundly unevenly cooked Linda sausages litter the area. Everybody has lost everything. Ian from P-Hex goes to sleep on the ground. Jamie is heading back to the High Chaparral (though I can never remember this name - I keep on wanting to say \"Camp X-Ray\" but I know that's not right, so I just sort of get lockjaw), but before he goes he seals me into the back of Russell's motor, where I plan to sleep. As the hatchback closes on me I give him the thumbs-up through the glass. I feel like a spaceman being sealed in his little capsule. <p/> I awake to the sound of somebody (Curtis, as it turns out) playing electric guitar. It's quite beautiful, but it's coming from far away and I'm still three-quarters asleep and it's a little bit hard to make out. There are weird little high frequency squeaks going on, which I assume must be the amplified sound of fingers on strings. Once I extract myself from the back of the car in an ungainly fashion, it becomes clear that these high frequency squeaks are, in fact, coming from a small and excited dog, whom Misery and Sarah are tormenting with a luminous green frisbee. <p/> The morning is overcast but incredibly hot. Bodies are strewn across the field. There is suffering. Somehow, heroically, Mr. Cotton takes the wheel of his car and prepares to take us home. Russ urges him to visit the cheese shop in Monkland. <p/> \"Yeah, just gimme the fuckin' cheese!\" cries Stevie G with feeling. <p/> That's right. Monkland. Also, not far from here, they have a place called Paincastle. <p/> A road closure because of an accident on the A-44 leads to our being compelled to drive home over the very roof of the world. I fall asleep in the back of the car, and awake to find that we are pulling into a gas station. In Telford. It has to be said, it is a class gas station, with a proper shop and a nice Days Inn attached, so that you could - in theory - check in for a few days and get a proper feel for the place. A kind man in London subsequently sent me the attached illustration, showing clearly the delights of checking in at the Telford Days Inn. <p/> We arrived in NN1 at teatime, battered. Once again, a superlative party out in Builth. Some of them were out there for days.

He looks at me: \"How long do you think we'll last?\" <p/> He's got a point. We aren't really the kind of thing that you see in village pubs a great deal. Yes, we do the odd cover version, but no, it's not Status Quo or Travis. We're also kind of loud. Despite the fact that we've been invited there to play for Guy Fletcher's long-awaited birthday knees-up, there is a detectable whiff of \"Is that all you do?\" on the breeze with this one. <p/> For the first time in ages we arrive at the gig in the dark. E-Man having thoroughly explored the entire region, I finally persuade him to drive us into Weedon village itself, where we soon spy a small traffic congestion scenario as the other memers of the band load their kit into an attractive, flower-bedecked country pub. Not the sort of place we usually play. At all. I slip in through the door to discover that the pub is (a) really rather tiny, and (b) extremely loud. This is down to a pack of young village lads, average age about 19 (don't it make you sick, American readers?), who are already blind, screaming drunk at 6:30pm. As I struggle my amp into position on a skittles table I console myself with the thought that, by the time we go on, all these boys will be lying quietly in a coma somewhere. <p/> With a great deal of help from Mister Fletcher we get ourselves installed and wired up in a tiny space at the end of the bar. <p/> With the lads still howling all around us, we launch into a version of Hippy Shit for a sound check.

Next we are going to tell people that E-Man is Norwegian, Misery is Scottish and Agent Wilson was born in a boxcar on the Santa Fe railroad. Stevie G himself, of course, really is from Argentina. Mister Fletcher, being a pro musician himself, has thoughtfully laid on a top spread, which is gratefully mauled by the assembled. Then there is frantic rolling and smoking prior to our return to the pub and the Moment of Truth. <p/> The bar is heaving. It's Friday night anyway, Guy's pals have all come out for his party, and then there is a surprisingly large numer of folks out from NN1 to see the group. All very gratifying, but it's more than Bot and I can handle, so we head back out into the car park. Around the back of the pub is a lovely wee garden. I am transfixed by an enormous and very beautiful willow tree billowing out over the lawn. I'm thinking how good it would look in the bright October sun. Bot says it looks like a Wookie. We pile onto the little kiddies' assault course erection, cross a precarious rope bridge and arrive at the top of a wooden tower, where we enjoy a panic attack. <p/> Duly refreshed by our brush with nature's grandeur we take up our instruments and start Hippy Shit for real. Within seconds Bot's mic stand is on the floor in bits. It's a bit of an avant-garde design, honestly, and it stands no chance with the plucky MC. The room is full of people sitting at tables, all facing us as if asking \"So why do you want this job, Mister Wilson?\" The situation is weird, but the sound is surprisingly together. It's a bit like skateboarding (with my centre of gravity!), but we arrive gracefully enough at the end of this rather hostile opener to what sounds like applause. Onward! <p/> It all went pretty sweetly. There were times when I was finding it hard to hear the backing track. For a while I tried seeing what would happen if I took my cue from watching Misery's fingers hitting the strings. Probably easier to follow Agent, honestly, but you don't know until you try. It all held together well, though, and went down well with the assembled. In fact the landlady asked for our phone number so that she could book us again! Good grief. We gave it to her as well. What were we thinking? We'd just got away with murder, after all. <p/> After the show I enjoyed a pint with Pete Watkins from the Bareback Ryders, handed out a couple of CDs, heard a couple more Happy Mondays comparisons and one with Alabama 3. We've got no problem with that short of comparison at all. We find it flattering. Thanks. We got invited to play a party in NN1. We had another beer and packed up. <p/> Then something rather strange came to pass. Looking out of the pub window I saw a large minibus, engine running, with members of the group climbing aboard. Instinct takes over at times like this. I had been told that Guy had laid on a ride home for us at about 1:00am. And yet here at midnight stood The Bus before my very eyes. Well, of course, that was me on board with all my kit. Turned out to be completely the wrong bus. Missed the party after the gig. Bah. Never mind - back to MC Bot's and from there to liquor-induced oblivion. <p/> So we got away with playing the village pub. An away win, we all agreed. And, as I said to Misery, when I'm up there on the stage at Cargo with that big old Turbosound system and all those fancy lights and shit, I shall remember where it was that I played the gig before that."},{"gigtext_id":456,"datetime":"2003-10-16 22:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Finally Wilson invade the capital.

First the fool managed to up-end himself, tripping over his treasured skinning-up granite and sailing through the air with Klinnsman-like grace (Arsene Wenger is reported to have said \"I did not see eet\"). This left him with a massive limp. Then he caught the flu. Then, even as the foot began to improve, he developed the most god-awful low back pain as a result of his ludicrous gait earlier in the week. To cap it all he tried to pass a speaker cabinet to Misery at soundcheck, emitted an unearthly wail and went down flat on the floor of the venue.

With lighting genius Johnny P unable to make this show, the stage was shrouded in darkness as the infamous \"Sheep Tape\" began to roll, leading eventually into a version of God's Green Earth that immediately suggested that this might turn into a bit of a night. And that is what came to pass. Although barely able to move, the plucky guitar scientist was seriously \"on\", and he was not alone. With the lights never really rising above an eerie glow, this was a dark and ferocious set. MC Bot fronted accordingly, with apparently random cries of \"Shit!\" and \"Fuck!\" between the tunes. (Occasionally Mister E. Wilson could be heard translating: \"Botty says Thank You.\") Stevie G delivered great squalls of guitar noise across Police Chief and Buffalo Sniper.

Wilson succumbs to the slumber-related after-effects of a festive feed. With the Rocket Hi-Fi boys unable to make it, DJ Ethan comes to the rescue (direct from the hospital) with a top set of dirty breakbeats, house and shouting. The night is free, the room fills up. In the cupboard beside the stage there is a dense fog. <p/> A decidedly croaky Headstone takes the stage. \"Ladies and gents, the Authorities haven't been entirely straight with you. Despite what you might have heard from the Administration, in fact...WE'VE got him.\" <p/> For a second you can hear an entire pub going \"What?\" <p/> And then he appears. Weaving to the beat like some grotesque, murderous parody of David Brent, sporting an enormous parka and a Santa Claus hat and clutching a single microphone, the former president of Iraq takes the stage. <p/> Wilson and their new vocalist start up with an unusually slow version of Dark Agenda. Uh...can they do that? I mean, doesn't it all come off a tape or something? The guitars are on Loud once again, and the tune cuts up beautifully towards the end.

And here's MC Bot - ooh, he is a Master of Disguise! But oh no! Who's going to do the crime rap? Oh, everybody. That's all right then. Third verse, same as the first but worse. As Critters kicks off, the Rev. Lindsay Spence comes onstage to deliver some midnight mass of his own. Headstone and Misery hang on for dear life as Lindsay and Bot howl at each other across the beats. Every Saturday Night follows, bobbing and weaving. Then it's Quality People and Police Chief. Buffalo Sniper (one for the dads). Then it's Istanbul Connection. About half way through there is an Istanbul Disconnection. Things spin out into a big spacious dub.

Andy Skank has brought a lovely little PA system into the Labour Club. Nice and easy - no mess, no pins, no fuss. There were red candles on all the tables and we played Rachid Taha, John Martin, Tim Keegan and the Electric Gypsyland album as people came in and sorted out their various drinking needs. Andy showed me the Secret Door and what it's for. Oh yes, doors really do open when you're an Organiser. We lurked in the eaves of the club and admired a small sporting trophy that had been concealed there. <p/> <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> is first up. I've seen Joe a few times before. I really like what he does, but he freaks me out because of his extraordinary resemblance to the young Kevin Ayers. A tall, skinny, cheeky white bloke singing the blues, Joe charms the audience from the start. He's borrowed Curtis' guitar too, so for the first time he doesn't have to worry about keeping the instrument near the microphone, on account of it's already plugged into the PA direct. The result is easily the best sound I have heard Joe have. Splendid stuff. No fighting or anything. Marvellous. <p/> Then it's time for Fat Bloke Karaoke. I have my Burns in my lap and my DAT player by my side. I'm all set to screw shit up royally. Soon there will be howls of \"Judas\" from the acoustic music fans. Soon the management will be asking \"Is that all he does?\" <p/> In fact, just for a moment, it appears that I may not even be going to get that far. The DAT takes an alarmingly long time to roll, but when it does I'm off on a wing and a prayer and a Fun Lovin' Criminals sample. I play: Out Of Touch Radio Saigon A new song, which is currently - and terrifyingly - called \"Brian Wilson\" Scarlett and Indian Summer. Despite the fact that the new tune is a complete and utter dirge, it all goes down remarkably well. I make a few screw-ups on the guitar, but nothing too ghastly. I think that Fat Bloke Karaoke may be around for a while to come. Oh, it's not really called Fat Bloke Karaoke. It's called \"Pat Fish\". For the moment anyway. You know, I rather like Fat Bloke Karaoke. With the fat bloke duly unplugged comes the first appearance of Ghost Train. Steve Gordon, Ian Anderson and Kathy Schaer park themselves on stools on the stage. The gentlemen have acoustic guitars, the lady a big old acoustic bass. There is not so much as a microphone anywhere near them. \"We're Ghost Train, and we play acoustic music,\" says softly-spoken Steve, and it begins to dawn on the punters that if they want to catch any of this stuff they had better shut the feck up. Wonderfully, after a little shooshing, the crowded club really does fall silent as Ghost Train open up with a beautifully authentic western swing instrumental. The room watches entranced as Kath sings a lonesome prairie sort of cowboy song, another perky wee instrumental flashes by and they are gone, to thunderous applause. Lovely music, properly played. And it's free to get in, for Heaven's sakes. <p/> Steve later told me that he hadn't realised quite how quiet the band were going to sound in a club situation. Nothing that a couple of well-placed overhead mics won't fix next time. <p/> As the Budvar flowed, Curtis E. Johnson picked up a guitar in public for the first time in an age. Picking deliberately through every nuance of the spicey little minor chord sequence, he opened up with The Harlem Hamfats classic \"Weed Smoker's Dream\". Rough and tough, we couldn't get enough. We got Big Jake, we got that tune about mining in outer space, we got a sublime version of \"Breathe\", we got a rare and precious version of the Boris Yeltsin song, we got songs about repression in Guatemala and we got songs about Cullen Skink. Best of all, we got a completely unexpected and utterly riveting rendition of Brian Eno's \"The Fat Lady Of Limbourg\". Unforgettable! <p/> So that was my first attempt at Acoustic Allstars. Nobody got hurt, everybody got paid. Tidy. The next one will be on Friday 5th March at the Labour Club once again, and I'll pass on details of the bill when it's finalised. Until then, thanks to all at the Labour Club, to Andy Skank, to all the artists and to all the people who came and listened.

Wilson officially retired from active service and Agent Cooper inescapably embroiled in a nationwide roll-out of new, improved agricultural software, the remaining Wilson Four resolve to travel in style for this trip to the West Country. Since we are all set to borrow back line amps from Applecraft, we really have very little luggage, so we ask to rent a car, rather than our usual van. What we end up with is a magnificent new Chrysler MPV with automatically retracting wing mirrors. For MC Bot this is love at first sight. <p/> We set off mid-afternoon in bright sunshine and reach Oxford effortlessly. Somewhere on the road to Swindon Bot and I discover the under-seat heating and laugh like delighted infants as our bums grow ever toastier. Then, just as we hit the M4 south of Swindon, it begins to snow. \"Are people driving like c****s yet?\" inquires Stevie G from the back seat. <p/> From the centre of NN1 to the edge of Bath takes us two hours. >From the edge of Bath to Moles Club takes us another hour. People are indeed driving like c***s: when, that is, they bother to drive at all. We eventually arrive at the club to find a bemused member of staff milling about on her own. She tells us that there is no promoter, no soundman, no Applecraft. They are all Out There somewhere, lost in the snow. A phone call to Jon Mattock reveals that the Applecraft bus is trapped in a tragi-comic ballet of incompetent school-run drivers, sliding around on the many and fearsome hills of Bristol. There is nothing for it. We head for the pub. <p/> We grab a beer and a bite to eat. Meanwhile, down in the club, the sound man has arrived. To my delight I spend ten whole minutes alone with him, making alliances for the future. We check out our backing tracks on the PA, just in case there isn't time for a sound check. Good thinking, as it will turn out. <p/> I am milling about in the street outside the club, talking to Dave Francolini on the phone. There is a very young guy with some kind of orthopaedic stick, hanging around by the club door. As I head back into the club, he stops me at the steps. \"Could you catch me if I fall?\" he asks. No problem; I wait as he negotiates the steep little stone steps into the club. \"Thanks,\" he says, \"I'm Greg, the promoter.\" Just as well that I was in a helpful mood, then. <p/> A local support band appears. They are called Eftus Septun (I think) and they are total rustic mental headcases. They tell us that, if Applecraft fail to make it, we can use their backline. One of their guitar amps is so old that it looks like they found it in a barn. It is but a small comfort. <p/> We repair to the Chrysler to smoke and play Black Sabbath 4. What an extraordinary mix of great musicianship and utter ineptitude it truly is! There's one little break where the guitarist doesn't even attempt to get his part right - in fact, it sounds to me as if he doesn't even know what notes he is trying to play; he just wants this bit over with. So he piles on through, hopelessly splashing a few notes around and hoping for the best. But - hey! - it's all right. The rest of the band are so monged out on red wine and shit that they don't even notice. Incredible! <p/> Somewhere the wrong side of 8:00 o'clock, Applecraft finally appear. Jon and Mike Mooney have spent more than six hours trying to drive the 15 miles from Bristol to Bath. We are awful pleased to see them and hang around while they set up and soundcheck. There's no time for us to check too, but at least I get to spend five minutes checking out the guitar amp that I shall be using for the next two days. <p/> Things are set and ready to go. We pile back into the Chrysler and listen to Evil Heat as we watch the punters filing down to the club. To reach the door they have to pass down a flight of stone steps. Of course, these steps are covered in snow and well slippy. One by one we watch the punters trying to negotiate these stairs, and it is entertainment of the highest class. Within minutes we are all trying to predict the next one to take a tumble...and when the next one duly does, hilarity erupts. It must be a bit of a shock for John Punter to hear a sudden burst of savage and triumphant laughter from what only moments ago appeared to be a parked and empty vehicle across the street. This, of course, just makes us laugh even harder. Later, as we take the stage, Bot will tell them: \"You're already the most entertaining audience we've ever had.\" <p/> We catch the end of Eftus Septun, or whatever they're called. It is utterly mental. Mad, discordant, scuttling crab-dancing music, delivered in unbelievably short bursts. All three of the rustic headcases can really play, but they are freely squandering their talents on playing this itchy-scratchy Frank Zappa garbage. Bot later raises the possibility that maybe they were \"trying to do a US Maple sort of thing.\" Well, perhaps they were. I always found US Maple unlistenable too. Still, they are all very nice, friendly, helpful blokes, who trim their guitar strings in a neat and tidy fashion. Weird. Must be a village thing. <p/> The next band, Milf, are much more of a mainstream operation; standard-issue sub-Radiohead indie angst, with really, really horrid singing. I hide in the dungeon-like dressing room (ambient temperature Ten Below) and smoke frenziedly. <p/> The next thing you know, the opening drones of Police Chief are ringing across the dancefloor. As the beats kick in, dancing breaks out. Fists punch the air. Bot and I start shouting. The Wilson Four are in effect. Half way through the set my guitar loses all power. Figuring that it must be something along the line of effects that has gone down, I pull my lead out and plug directly into the amp. For the rest of the set I am obliged constantly to zip over to the amp to change the settings. It's busy work, and I make the occasional rather loud mistake with the amp, but quite quickly this leads to a somewhat carefree attitude with the feedback and I am soon having a bit of a night. Steve responds to this and we become a sort of scary goth funk band for twenty minutes. <p/> The moment that we finish Buffalo Sniper, we are packing up and making room for Applecraft. As soon as all my kit is safely back in the oubliette - sorry, \"dressing room\" - I am in motion again. I seek out the promoter, who is beaming and saying things like \"Groovy!\" I'm pleased about this, but what I need to know is where I can find a cash machine. He sets me on the path and out of the club I go; out onto the street, round the corner, down the hill, turn right, hit the machine, back up the hill and into the club. I find my way to the quiet upstairs bar, order a drink and ask where I can find a cigarette machine. I get the right change from the bartender. I find and negotiate the cigarette machine. Then, as Applecraft start up, I sit down next to Misery and - fifteen minutes after coming off stage - finally light my fag. It is one of The Great Cigarettes of the Modern Age. <p/> So - Applecraft. Here is a band that epitomises the strange but enduring relationship between the musicians of Northampton and Bristol. Jon Mattock, the drummer, and bassist Adrian Utley are both Northampton born and raised. The others are Bristol-based: Mike Mooney (guitarist, singer), Mike Crawford (guitarist), Sean Cook (harmonica) and Don Miranda (the singer). The musicians have a ridiculous pedigree involving Julian Cope, Echo & The Bunnymen, Spacemen 3, The Perfect Disaster, Spiritualised, Portishead and Goldfrapp. Not to mention the fact that Adrian used to play in celebrated NN1 soul band The Army (alongside a youthful Alex Green, as it goes). Applecraft have 2 albums out on Ochre Records: \"The Shining City On The Hill\" and \"The Happiest Man Alive\", which is newly released and the hook on which they are hanging these shows. <p/> Their confident, professional musicianship is immediately apparent, even though this is their first show together. Jon, of course, is such an inspirational drummer that he lifts any group with which he plays. Mooney is certainly responding, and although Adrian doesn't always seem to know quite where the song is going next, his rich and powerful bass still does just what it's supposed to do. The sound is rich and melodic, but it has a sort of seventies quality that makes me think of Badfinger or Free. Not what I was expecting, but fine anyway. <p/> I have a very pleasant conversation with a nice man from Ochre Records and two disctinctly odd conversations with two different young men, one of whom thinks I look like Brian Ferry, the other of whom appears to belive that I am Brian Ferry. As the club closes up we grab a bunch of beer and jump into the Chrysler for the drive to Bristol, which, I am happy to report, took nothing like six hours. We head back to Mike Mooney's place and pass a very agreeable few hours drinking and smoking there before rolling up in our bedding and going to sleep."},{"gigtext_id":478,"datetime":"2004-02-27","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Mike Mooney and Jon Mattock from Lupine Howl have another band, called Applecraft.

Bot quickly notes the differences in our navigational styles: \"Jon does cake shops for landmarks - Pat does pubs!\" <p/> Safely back at Mooney's, we relax. Then comes a moment of disbelieving panic when Jon rings to say that his van has died. Two or three phone calls later, it turns out that the consummate professional has just let his bus run out of gas. Relieved, Bot and Mooney take him petrol, while we get the kit together for sound check. <p/> Getting your equipment into Bristol's Folk House involves climbing about thirty steep concrete steps, making a U-turn and going back along a balcony some fifteen yards to the stage door. I do not envy Applecraft as they tote their enormous bass wardrobe up the stairs. Inside there is a big, wooden room with a very small vocal PA. On the walls are posters for a forthcoming show by Julie Felix. The big, wooden room is strewn with tastefully arranged chairs and tables. It makes me nervous. Bot is travelling down with Mooney. Steve, Kath and I load our stuff in, then, while The Craft essay a soundcheck, we head for the Hatchet Inn. <p/> The Hatchet Inn claims to be one of the oldest surviving pubs in England, dating back to fifteen-something. It is certainly one of the hardest pubs to get into. We skirt around its exterior for some time without finding any door; then, as we round the beer garden (protected by hefty wrought iron railings), we find ourselves in a small urban wind tunnel. A short struggle up here and we gain entrance. We sit down to a peaceful bite to eat and a drink. <p/> Back at the Folk House, the Craft are struggling with the classic \"Big Room - Little PA\" interface. Mike Crawford goes whizzing around Bristol at dizzying speeds to lay his hands on various items of kit. We mill about, quietly wondering whether we will even be able to attempt a set through the system that they have here. Eventually we get a soundcheck and eventually we even have a reasonable sound. Much patience all round and eventual satisfaction. Midway through our check the Langley brothers show up, but by the time we have got things right they are gone again. I set out towards the street to see if I can find them, but instead I run into Syd and Anna Meats up from Romsey, so then it's back to the bar for draft Budvar and pancake recipes (this last bit really floats MC Bot's boat). <p/> Gerard Langley reappears, minus John, who's gone home for a nice night in. \"He's not that sociable really,\" offers Gerard, not entirely convincingly. Gerard reveals to us that our soundman is his current bass player. Oh yes, and the bartender is his guitarist. Truly, we are all Gerard's ducks. The great Joe Allen stumbles by, bent on poetry-related mayhem. Gabriel and Joe (no relation) are up from Exeter. It's a nice vibration. <p/> After a set of gospel dementia from a man whom I only know as Jesse (he is, to be fair, a rightly celebrated fixture on the Bristol scene and a phenomenally gifted guitar player), we get onstage at about a quarter to ten. The room is hardly heaving, but all the chairs are taken up and there is a reasonable crowd. The fact that they are sitting down in this nice, big wooden room is pretty disconcerting, mind. Stevie G later declares this the weirdest gig that he has ever done. \"They just sort of sat there and looked at you.\" He's right. There's hardly a rocking atmosphere, and the lighting is pretty funny too. My equipment is working properly tonight, at least. We deliver our set (the same as last night) to a reasonable response, but nothing really catches fire. In a situation like this we miss Agent Wilson and his percussion. The set is all quite competent, but we can't really get any vibrations going, making our little noise in this big, wooden room. Still, I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, honking and blatting away up there. In some ways it was an improvement on Bath, but we missed having the people near us, leaping about. <p/> By the way, while we're on the subject of weird gigs, might I just point out that it was Steve Gordon who, a few short years ago, booked us into a gig at a roller skating rink, where the audience came at you downhill at about fifteen miles per hour in an endless stream? <p/> Once our kit is offstage and out of the way, a very portentous gentleman comes onstage and tells us all to shut up because now there's going to be a poet and she's going to be very good. I pack my kit bag in nervous silence, occasionally looking up to see if MC Bot has succumbed to the giggles yet. Kit safely stowed, we leave the punters to their culture and make a bee-line for the bar. <p/> By now the place is filling up, and there are lots of good old faces to be seen. Angelo Bruschini is in the house; Paul Wigens (who plays in a band called Grand Drive with two Wilson brothers!) is here; Franco and Tony have turned up, saying nice things about our band; Pat Duff, late of Strangelove, is here, looking fantastic. Apparently he's been making a record with Alex Lee. Well, as ideas go, I'd say that was a good one. To be honest, there's that much of a party feeling going off that I don't see too much of Applecraft's set. What I do see sounds surprisingly good, given the technical situation, and goes down well. An easy home win for The Craft. \"Wait till we get you at home,\" we taunt them. <p/> At closing time we board the Chrysler. We have decided to head for NN1 directly tonight and wake up in our own beds. We navigate our way out of Bristol without any difficulty, and as we hit the M32 out of town, I notice that it is just past one in the morning. To the sounds of the Fun Loving Criminals and The Stranglers we speed effortlessly through the night, arriving back at my front door at a scarcely credible half-past-two. A quick bevvy and we're off to bed ready for tomorrow's gig."},{"gigtext_id":480,"datetime":"2004-02-28","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Mike Mooney and Jon Mattock from Lupine Howl have another band, called Applecraft.

Let's hear it for the Labour Club."},{"gigtext_id":481,"datetime":"2004-02-28","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"The first \"consummate professional\" moment of our day comes at about four o'clock this afternoon, when Mike Mooney rings to say that the hire company which had promised them a van had shut up shop before they even got there! We make arrangements for Applecraft to use our backline kit and decide that, if they are going to be late, we might as well soundcheck first. This we duly do, and we are just finishing up when the Bristol massive arrives. <p/> I'm talking to Adrian Utley about Northampton, explaining that I live just around the corner from the club, near Colwyn Road. He says that he used to live on Colwyn road, in one of those big old houses that back onto the Racecourse. \"Oh yes,\" I say, \"They're nice houses, those.\" He looks at me as though I have taken final leave of my senses. Of course, he knew Colwyn Road years ago, before the property developers and kids with sports cars moved in, back when it was the P.I. capital of Northamptonshire. I feel forced to tell him that we shan't be much older before the first pavement cafe appears on Colwyn Road. <p/> By the time that The Craft have acquainted themselves with our kit and come to terms with the \"Little Room - Big PA\" interface, the room is already filling with punters. Somebody says to me \"I thought you were going to play first.\" Max Eider (for it is he), MC Bot and I take off for a quick veggie burger and a smoke round at Shakespeare Villas. <p/> We return to find the room chock full of people, with a faintly agitated DJ Andy keen for us to get on and get started. With unnerving speed we do exactly that. We have the Agent back tonight, and any swing that was missing in Bristol is back with a vengeance. We start with Quality People and Critters. The sound is good and strong and we're playing well. I am, I must confess, having one of my Loud Nights. The audience are really warm and responsive (what else can they honestly do with us crammed in their faces like this?) and we race through the best set of the three, finishing with Dark Agenda. The set has been a success. Andy Skank does something that nobody has ever done before. He calls our sound \"sexy\"! <p/> Upstairs in the Keir Hardie Room, which has been temporarily re-assigned the Dressing Room, I meet Olga. Olga comes from the Czech Republic and would appear to be some kind of music journalist. She has bravely travelled up from London on her own to see Applecraft, and now she wants to know what I do in the band. I have to explain that she has just missed the chance to see what it is I do. <p/> Olga is concerned about the security of her bag. I assure her that it will be fine up here, out of the way. \"Put it under a coat or something, if you want, love.\" \"Yes...that is what I did in Sheffield and they stole my bag there.\" I try to explain that people in Sheffield are dangerous desperados and that NN1 is altogether more chilled, but she is having none of it. She removes a cassette tape, on which she has recorded an interview with the Undertones, and puts it in her pocket. Then she scoops up a box of Applecraft records and heads downstairs into the throng, bent on sales. I pack up and rejoin Max and Kathie in the hot and crowded bar just as The Craft are kicking off. This time I get to see pretty much the whole of their set, and very fine it is too, a quantum leap from the previous two (just like us, I suppose). The core of Jonny, Adrian and Mooney is raging. Having had trouble making himself heard at the soundcheck, Mooney employs the Turn-It-Up-To-Eleven approach and sprays the bar with wild psychedelic lead guitar. Jonny goes mental. This in turn inspires Mooney to do something even more ludicrous. And so it goes on for forty-five minutes until they drive the truck into the wall on a little thing called \"Quo Country\"! Mooney is standing on an amp, grinning like a maniac and playing the bass for reasons known only to him. Adrian Utley is attacking his guitar in a profoundly un-Portishead sort of a way. The sound is phenomenal, as loud as the building can stand, and the players are making it only too clear how and why they acquired that ludicrous pedigree. It's a bravura display of lush, muscular psychedelic rock and roll, which leaves everybody in the house soaking wet and grinning like a fool. <p/> Most of the Craft are heading back to Bristol. Jonny is coming to the Wilson party at Misery's place just up the road. So, it turns out, is Olga, for it is late now and Misery has offered her a room for the night. The trouble lies in actually getting Olga from the Labour Club to Misery's yard. \"Go with Pat,\" Mooney urges her, \"He'll see you all right.\" Olga looks at Mooney. She looks at me. Then she looks at Mooney again. Her brow is troubled. \"I don't which one is scarier - you or him,\" she says. <p/> Eventually, with a lot of help from Kathie McGinty, we convince Olga that she is not about to be sold into the white slave trade, and she and her bag finally follow us back to a splendid party, where her diffidence vanishes upon contact with Misery's record collection. As Brian said when I saw him a day or so later: \"That was a good old night. I don't remember how I got home.\" <p/> We still don't know for sure whether MC Bot ever gave them back their Chrysler."},{"gigtext_id":492,"datetime":"2004-03-05","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Next Acoustic Allstars is on Friday 5th March at the Labour Club, NN1, your host: The Butcher. <p/> This month we have a special treat, a headline set from Mrs. Pilgrimm to celebrate the release of her new album, The Alone Queen.

Well, be fair. Still they come. Thanks, guys. <p/> There were two separate vibrations going on at the same time, and I'm not just thinking of the band's pharmaceutical intake. <p/> No, the audience were quiet and subdued. Maybe, I reckon, they were just plain oppressed by the sheer volume and darkness of the alleged entertainment. Everybody I spoke to after the show seemed well taken with the set; they just weren't about to let us know while it was going on. Or something. A lot of people didn't realise that we had finished either. They thought that maybe we would be going on for a second set. Well, I must admit that the majority of us do look like we belong in a a pub band, but really. No, folks, if you wanted more you should have done the old ritual thing and shouted and shit. Oh, hang on, that's right. I hate the rock concert ritual. Oh, this was a confusing one. <p/> Meanwhile, back in the delusion jungle... <p/> Onstage Wilson are having the night of their lives. The track is crisp and bright and brutal, the bass is heavy, the guitarists have only ever heard Arc and Weld in their lives. As far as we are concerned, we are a heaving black crater of evil doom and justice. Botman Bot doesn't even turn up for the first two verses. You can see people wondering and worrying. Are we going to watch this band fall to pieces right in front of our eyes on an innocent Saturday night out? First no Curtis, now no Bot...what can it all mean? Botman Bot arrives via the front door, bang on time to deliver Curtis' crime rap on God's Green One. Headstone is yelling \"rip up the phone boxes!\" It's all edgy, sparky, exciting. To us anyway. Maybe it looks unprofessional or something. We know that the sound is good. Andy's magic PA strikes again. <p/> It's into a new tune next. I wrote the words to the chorus the morning after the gig. Well, it'll be an excuse to come down to the next one, won't it? Then we're off into a run of 3 rockers. Somewhere in the midst thereof, we achieve Our Perfect Sound. It's evil and fizzing and swinging its massive great ass all over the place. There's singing - harmonies even - and shouting and banging and wailing and squawking and Stephen Fecking Hawking. We do the best version ever of Buffalo Sniper. Yes, I was compelled to sing large chunks of \"Rocking in the Free World\" at the same time as Bot was doing the proper lyric. Do you want to make something of it? <p/> After a sneaky little Secret Government we descend into a swaggering and hostile version of Play It All Night Long. Every Saturday Night does nothing to lighten the mood. Critters is chiefly about shouting and violence and war and hate and the Loch Ness Monster and it's over in a second and then it's all aboard the Taliban Jeep for a swift and sweaty-palmed review of Wilson's Dark Agenda. <p/> It kicks off. Botman Bot is giving it \"Bitter & twisted! Go ballistic!\" from Fat Controller. The kick drum is a truck. The bass is a huge big tanker full of something with a specific gravity far in excess of its half-life. The guitars are fizzing like nasty little cluster bombs. Inevitably, there is a hideous and protracted pile-up. The poor bloody audience are witnessing something that has nothing to do with either entertainment or anger management. Fuck, it feels good. <p/> And that's it. Lord, it's quiet. Me, I just reckon people were shell-shocked. <p/> You know, maybe we just weren't entertaining. Maybe we've become so dark and demented that it's just no fun to be around us any more. Maybe we've just got old and crass and boring. <p/> But from where we're sitting, the band is moving up to another dimension. We're into one of our phases right now, and, if it be the Will of God, the next few shows could see Wilson mutating into something even more mental. Given that the next gig is in Builth, I'd be prepared to take a punt on that. <p/> Fishboy 05:34 am 19/4/2004"},{"gigtext_id":464,"datetime":"2004-04-30 18:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"It's a big production: Wilson, P-Hex, Good Cop Bad Cop, A Fat Dog Sound and two Welsh bands!

On the way we pass the roadside Army Surplus store with the armoured car for sale on the forecourt. We notice that Jamie Jab's new motor is parked up there. Later in the evening he will appear, sporting a magnificent pair of paramilitary chrome goggles. At this stage, Jamie Jab has been up for 24 hours and counting. <p/> We check ourselves into the excellent Edan House B&B, where Wilson, like all the greats, have an entire floor to themselves.It's not that big a house. In my room, on the windowsill, in a strange pentagonal case of wood and glass, displayed on tiny, custom-made wooden stands are two eggs. Two eggs with lovely miniature paintings on them. What on Earth can that be about? <p/> The Strand Hall stands all of seventy yards away from the front door of the hotel. No promoter worthy of the name would ever book a band into a hotel so convenient for the venue. The venue itself is a big old hall belonging to the Council. The organisers of the gig tell me that a lot of municipal arms have been twisted for us to be doing this here tonight. Ticket sales, we are told, have been good, and there is evidence of a massive and elaborate lightshow being set up on the large stage. There is a PA standing up there too, but there is nobody to wire it up. A man is on his way from Bristol, we are told. <p/> Now, one thing that we have grown used to in Builth is waiting. Without so much as a discussion, we acknowledge that there is going to be no point in our milling about here for some considerable time. Kit is parked in strategic positions backstage, ready for a swift set-up immediately prior to playing. The dressing room receives its customary Awesome Baptism of Smoke. Within fifteen minutes we have washed our hands of the Strand Hall and we're back on the charming streets of Builth, bent on hot food. <p/> After a brief period in the Zone we are welcomed at the Barley Mow for wholesome dining and beer. Convinced that this is, in fact, a Saturday (dammit - it's always been Saturday in Builth before...) I spend a moment fretting about the football results. There are, of course, none. Fed and watered, we engage in a little light shopping for late night beer, then return to base to watch Pobol Y Cum on the telly. <p/> Some of our number stop by at a little funfair which has set up beside the river in the park. There is a thing there called Monkey Kingdom. Thanos is with us. There are a number of odd little machines there whose primary purpose would appear to be the piecemeal but dogged pollution of the otherwise unfeasibly wholesome Welsh air. Stevie Ward from Good Cop Bad Cop is profoundly irritated by the presence of this fair. He was planning on a quiet night's kip in the van beside the river. No chance of that now. <p/> Later, when Jamie and Yvette decide to stroll down and visit the funfair, it shuts down. <p/> We return to the venue to hear the last strains of Brown Thunder covering Cum On Feel The Noize. It's their first gig. They're schoolboys. They haven't played Glastonbury. We know this, for this is their first gig. (For a few moments overheard an hour or two later in the carpark, it appears that it may also turn out to be their last.) They may be named after a Roy Chubby Brown video. Their bass player later lends us his amplifier after negotiations so complex that several UN staff had to be called in. At the end of the night he is to be seen sitting on the bottom of the steps outside the venue, barfing like a professional. \"Has he lost his lunch?\" I ask one of his pals. \"Oh, he lost that a long time ago.\" <p/> A Fat Dog Sound get themselves onstage with commendable speed, then stay up there for about thirty six hours. They have a new, improved drummer and I still think their bassist is great. They are moving into a pretty strange place at the moment. Their opening number has shades of the Velvet Underground's \"Ocean\". <p/> Fat Dog are followed by Good Cop Bad Cop, with MC Bot at the controls. Strangely, things appear to have taken a turn for the loud. I actually manage to spend all the Good Cop set outside the building, but this in no impedes my capacity for hearing and enjoying the music to the full. Ears must be bleeding in there. <p/> As the next band gears up to go onstage we take ourselves back stage to put the drums and stuff together. As we pass across the stage, Russ spots the pianist having A Right Artistic. Whatever is eating him soon gets sorted, for the band are up and playing...a James Brown number! \"Bloody hell, Steve - we've got to follow Tom Jones!\" Sadly, that's about as much fun as we have with them. Well, apart from being stimulated to re-open that well-loved Crap Sax Players Of The Eighties debate. <p/> And then the desperate minutes as we step out onto the stage to see if there is anybody out there to help us get plugged up. On asking one bloke for the sound man, I'm told \"There isn't one.\" Well, at least we've got that cleared up, then. Eventually the man from Bristol appears. He hasn't much of a clue what is going on, keeps saying he's on holiday, thinks he's in a place called \"Blythe\". Somehow he helps us get plugged up while at the front of the stage Fred Ryan has his eyebrows waxed off for charity. &pound;138:00 the pair, since you ask. <p/> Once Fred has been sufficiently tortured, we turn on the DAT and hope for the best. The backing track comes crashing back at us at about 60 billion decibels and we're off. Starting with Police Chief, it's a high energy set and soon there is action on the dance floor. We steam through a short and furious set, stopping only now and again when Stevie G - for reasons that he is still unable to clarify - insists on stopping the backing track. Not during the tunes themselves, you understand. He's not that gone, Jackson. Stevie Ward is at the controls now, doing a grand job. We deliver phatness and shouting in extra-large portions, blow up Dark Agenda and leave. As we go, two people shake my hand: one, a gnarly old rock dude in his forties, proper rock handshakes and everything; the other, a 17-year old Welsh chick in high street chic who thinks \"That was bloody excellent, that!\" Wilson - Bridging the Generation Gap. With shouting. <p/> P-Hex come to deliver the coup de grace to an audience fast falling to the effects of hard liquor and evil dub. The Rev. Lindsay does not disappoint and the funk machine rolls out, with the added firepower of Andy Fruish's trumpet combining with Ben's saxophones. Now that, boys and girls, is a horn section. At some stage MC Bot wanders onto the stage, apparently squeezing a version of Sumosonic's \"Business and work\" into the P-Hex repertoire. An encore is demanded and a strange jam ensues, a cool sort of major/minor thing, where I am surprised to hear Lindsay singing the oddly romantic line \"Such a smile!\" Your correspondent has since been set straight. The lyric is, of course: \"Such a slag!\" <p/> By the time that P-Hex are done with them, the punters are looking profoundly damaged. The lad from Brown Thunder is not alone. People are heaving and a-weaving. Outside the front doors, people are lying helpless in the road. <p/> The night has raised well over a thousand pounds for the Romanian hospice project.

Put on his DJ togs later, mind. Looking fly in his camo jacket and doing his groovy shit.

Perhaps they were still reeling from being shouted at by the Sweat Hogs International, rowdy cats that they are. Rolo didn't let that get to him, and by the time half an hour had passed, the room was with him. Andy told me that Geoff, the boss of the club and a former Mayor of Northampton, thought the music was splendid.

Earlier on, poor <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> found himself embroiled in something of a struggle, as he strained to be heard above the noise of a fairly large audience all arriving at once. \"It's a challenge, dude\" he told me, and he battled bravely on. Joe's guitar playing is coming on all the time and he won't be getting saddled with these opening slots too much longer, to be honest with you. So another top night for the Masters of Budvar. <p/> In four months we have taken over an ailing come-all-ye acoustic night and brought it to the point where nobody is in the least bit surprised or put-out to find a small madman spinning and mixing CDs of his own tunes, which - incidentally, Northampton - he created specially for the night. Along the way we've had singer-songwriters, rappers, beatniks, cellists, yodellers and laptop psychedelic droners. And Curtis E. Johnson singing The Fat Lady Of Limbourg. <p/> Are we enjoying this? Don't be stupid. <p/> Next month it accidentally really looks like a proper acoustic club. Gypsy jazz, western swing and a singer-songwriter from the same gang that brought you Dave Kusworth.

Widely admired in Northampton, they are led by Pete \"The Duke\" Watkins, who, of course, was the bassist in Tom Hall's astonishing Bareback Ryders. <p/> Micky Greaney is a singer-songwriter from Birmingham and a man for whom the phrase \"been there, done that\" might have been invented. A member of the scene which spawned the Subterranean Hawks, the Jacobites and...er...Duran Duran, Micky has played in full-on rock bands, performed as a solo artist, duetted with Dave Kusworth, and still found time to play Ronnie Scott's with a 12-piece jazz band! A brilliant guitarist, gifted with a spine-chilling voice; we are lucky to have him coming to play. <p/> Micky's career path has certainly confounded many and even frustrated as his genuinely anticipated second album is awaited. <p/> Well, the news is good - he has just put together an awesome band and has a frantic fire in his belly, undeniably witnessed at an Into The Music show at The Glee recently and they are recording too. <p/> His debut album Little Symphonies For The Kids (which featured Ocean Colour Scene) was awarded album of the year by the Evening Mail and saw him enter a production deal with legendary producer John Leckie (Radiohead, Pink Floyd etc.) and demo at Abbey Road Studios. This show sees him play solo acoustic, a setting when in the moments of the intense and passionate intimacies he creates, genius often appears in the forms of instinctive and heartfelt lyrics and raw heart on sleeve performance. With some stunning new material a treat lies in store. <p/> Ghost Train are Northampton's own Western Swing desperados, a trio featuring Steve Gordon (P. Hex/Wilson), Ian Anderson (P. Hex) and Kathy Schaer (Wilson). Last time they played Acoustic Allstars they played entirely acoustic to a stunned and silent audience, who were hypnotised by their music.

All the acts were on startling form Ghost Train opened, and despite the presence of a single microphone standing between them, played what amounted to a fully acoustic set. Any band that opens with \"Delia's Gone\" is getting off to a fine start. After a couple of appearances at the Cafe Veranda's wednesday night acoustic sessions, they played with calm and confidence. They were rewarded with plenty of attention and applause, except for one noisy soul who just couldn't keep it all in. He was like that Cat Stevens, in fact: he had to let it out. <p/> This he continued to do through the first couple of numbers from the sharp-suited Micky Greaney. Then Micky caught him out applauding a tune. \"What are you clapping for?\" he enquired, \"You haven't listened to a note of it.\" And then, with exactly the speed and grace of an entirely sober man moving to hit another man very hard, the diminiutive songwriter heaved his microphone stand up into the air and planted it firmly in front of Mister Noisy. \"Tell you what - why don't I sing this one just for you, and we'll see if you can't shut up and listen for five minutes?\" You guessed it. He shut up. Which enabled the rest of us to spend half an hour listening to the astonishing set that Micky had come to play. A wonderful set of classic songwriting. The voice is everything I've been told and a bit more. Special thanks to John Purcell for suggesting him for a gig here in the first place, and for going way, way beyond the call of duty in delivering him safely among us. We trust that they will both be back. <p/> Hot Mocambo swarm onto the tiny stage area like giant tea-head locust people (if I've remembered that bit exactly right...) and there is hot jazz for the lucky punters. The evening is changing gear again. <p/> Damn rhythmic they were, with Steve playing a full kit and Becca at his side with her percussion. The Duke played electric bass and the twin guitar strikers span melodies, counter melodies, rhythms, polyrhythms, multitap ping-pong poly-meta-rhythms and shit like that around the place like they had an urgent appointment to keep. For a moment or two they searched around for the right sound, but by their second tune they were blazing. Great musicians with great sounds playing Django jazz and a sort of mutated Latin bop at high speeds well loud. A marvellopus set that earned the band two encores, including a dreamy \"Nuages\" to close on. Marvellous. <p/> By this stage the Masters of Budvar were in full physical control of my frame, so naturally I found myself compelled to spend some time just veering around grinning like an eejit saying \"thank you\" to people. As you do, I suppose. But really, sincere thanks to all the players for three great sets. <p/> Or should that be four? For when the Masters of Budvar made it back to their Secret Antarctic Headquarters, the Mojo Soul Riot (c) came off almost straight away for another live set of songs from Micky. Then guitars began to pass around and something of a workshop was developing with Micky, <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> and me.

And what is happening in Northampton? Why it's overrun with Germans - I love this town! <p/> For this weekend it is Twinfest, where the bands from town get together with bands from our twin towns of Poitiers and Marburg with a view to putting on three days of loved-up rocking festivity, drunkenness and random acts of international kindness. Except that the poor old French people, struggling against government cutbacks at home, can't come this year. So it's just us and the Germans. I feel sorry for the French guys - mais naturellement - but I can't help feeling how appropriate it is that Brits and Germans should be putting together this good natured international hoedown at a time when far too many people are reviving far too many painful memories. <p/> There are, of course, matters of physical endurance to consider at such affairs. After Masters of Budvar on Friday night and the ensuing suicide mission - sorry, party - Russ and I felt that, if Wilson were ever going to make it onstage for their appointed hour of Sunday lunchtime, we had better devise a Plan. We found ourselves obliged to pick up our passes for the festival at a Twinfest gig in the Racehorse garden on Saturday. Knowing that we needed an early night before our set, we planned to nip down early in the evening, grab the passes, get blind drunk by half-past-eight and hit the sack around nine or ten. <p/> Half past eight arrives and the Plan is working perfectly. Various members of Wilson are strewn around the pub garden, passes safely secured, roaring drunkenly at the mighty Shiga Wire, Marburg's very own answer to Metallica. Only with Josh Homme for a lead singer. Yes, real good. <p/> But, reader, I am sure that by now you have spotted the Flaw in the Plan. <p/> Severely damaged and dressed in our best (just to show it off to maximum effect) we arrive at the pub. It is 11:00am and the sun is shining down like you wouldn't believe. It is a glorious morning in NN1 and we are in no state to appreciate it. One of us has not even slept at all. <p/> We make our way to the gates of Becket's Park, where a kindly soul in a yellow \"events\" tee shirt tells us that we can't bring our cars onto the festival site. Somewhere deep, deep inside me lurks a thought that (perhaps happily) I cannot physically articulate: we've only got ourselves into this lamentable state by making an ill-advised trip to the pub to pick up these STUPID GREAT CAR PASSES THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU ON OUR WINDSCREENS, MISTER C***Y. Patiently, and without making any panic calls on his Walky-Talky (it's the fecking Digital Revolution and these prats still have the same walky fecking talkies as they used to have in 1978. Probably handed down lovingly from father to son along with all those useless fecking post-punk Rough Trade records, then, eh?) he explains to us: \"She said no cars on site after eleven thirty.\" It is exactly eleven thirty two AM. <p/> Russ disappears into the park to find the great \"She\" while Kathy and I mill about, trying to stay alive and watching despondently as some shaven-headed buffoons hack down trees in order to facilitate the building of more flats for more vain and helpless Hollyoaks beings. Eventually Russ returns with a lady from the council, who graciously \"walks\" the car into the park. That's it. That's absolutely right. She walks along in front of the car, just to let people know that it's on its way. \"If she really wants to recreate the golden early days of motoring,\" I ask Russ, \"Shouldn't she at least have the decency to carry a red flag?\" <p/> Nobody dies and we make it to the backstage area. We unload our shit and listen to the first band of the day soundchecking. We try hard to get warmed up. This involves opening suicidal cans of beer, smoking everything to hand and hoping for the best. <p/> When we come on there is an audience of perhaps forty people, sitting in the bright sunshine on a big old hill in front of us. You could have fitted them all right there on the stage with us. If they had been up there, perhaps they would have heard the beats, because, if SPT (Subsequent Punter Testimony) is anything to go by, they never heard them out the front. <p/> So, yes, we banged away as best we could, and I guess we played all right; but it's all rather pointless if people out the front can't hear the drums. I must admit, I was quite flattered at the idea that a few of our mates thought us capable of deliberately playing without our beats...but, I mean, why would we?"},{"gigtext_id":486,"datetime":"2004-06-20","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"There is a gig on Sunday 20th June.

I'm uncertain as to the significance of this shouting, but I'm working on the basis that it is in some way supposed to be friendly. Welcome to the Acoustic Tendency's Little Day Out. <p/> The trip has been organised by Stevie Gordon, and it involves the cream of the Cafe Veranda scene, Ghost Train, <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> and Robert Bray, along with an ageing headcase with an electric guitar and DAT player. The Oakley Arms has a neat little venue upstairs called the Attic. The Vibrators are playing there soon. I shall go and see them, for Knox is cool. But we are not playing in The Attic; we are playing in the bar downstairs. A small PA is set up and the scary natives who were occupying the appointed \"stage\" area somehow relinquish their places on the sofa there to let us set up. <p/> Seizing the moment, I dive up, plant my amp on the sofa and commit some kind of sound check. Everything seems to be working, so I head back out into the car park. This is my big mistake. Andy Skank beckons me into his motor, where he, Joe and I sit and smoke. The Carter Family and the Be Good Tanyas are on the car stereo, which seems appropriate. What is a little bit stranger is that as we sit there, we can see (but not hear) Robert Bray and Kath Schaer practicing a tune on a bench right in front of us. Most confusing. <p/> We only have a little smoke, but as soon as we step out of the car, it's clear that there is going to be trouble. There are two doors into the pub. One of them is open, the other sports a large sign saying \"No Entry. Staff Only. Never, ever even try to come in through this door, fool.\" Joe lurches straight for the latter door. We have, it transpires, just smoked the Spliff Of No Return... <p/> Inside again I buy myself a Stella Artois at prices that wouldn't seem out of place in the West End of London and chat with Tim Coley the film maker, who is telling me that Natacha Atlas has just bought herself a cave in Andalusia. Kathy turns up with a big bag of chips: \"Hang onto these for me, will you?\" I imagine that she's just going up to do a sound check. Wrong. This is Ghost Train in full effect; this is The Set. Kath's chips are delicious. They don't help to sober me up, though. <p/> Ghost Train put in the best show that they have played yet. Steve's vocals are stronger and more confident than ever before, and the playing is well on the money. It's easy to be distracted by Portugal playing Spain on the (happily silent) TV by the bar, but they hold the attention and turn in a delightful bunch of tunes. I still have a few chips left to hand back to Kath when they finish. <p/> Next comes Joe. Boy, I begin to see what that smoke can do to a man! Out of tune for \"I Want You\", Joe nonetheless manages to hold it together for the rest of his set, until it comes time to introduce his rather lovely song \"Waiting For Emily\". Joe's got some kind of idea for a funny joke in his head: a pun on \"Weighting for Emily\" - tragically, he can't actually find the words to explain this to the punters. Handicapped by the fact that he has made himself laugh with the idea, Joe struggles to share it, laughing harder all the time. He's borderline hysterical. And, you know what? I know just how he feels. <p/> Oh, did I mention that they're making me play last? I don't know how much more of this reassuringly expensive Stella I can take and still hold my shit together. <p/> Robert Bray steps up and does his thing. Steve and I agree that we hate him. He's just too blinking good. Proper songwriting and a fantasic guitar picking technique. Beastly man! Kathy joins him on bass for a couple of tunes and does really well. Whisper it, but Kath is becoming something of a star in Acoustic World. There are a few punters in the room now (although all the provincial nu-metal kids have taken refuge in the beer garden out the back) and they show a proper appreciation for Rob's efforts. He goes down really well, which is no more than this disgustingly talented man deserves. <p/> At some point, while introducing a tune, Rob decides out loud: \"Bah! I should work in marketing.\" Quick as a flash, joe shouts back: \"Is that near Kettering?\" Most appropriate. <p/> And then it's my turn. I've failed to sober up, and I'm well discombobulated by that, let me tell you. Still, it's a nice easy version of Out Of Touch to start with, so off I go. That's when the natives start bellowing. I start Radio Saigon, they start shouting \"Pink Floyd!\" I don't mind, but it sure is weird. Ghosts next, which goes well, then a version of Shakey whereupon I manage to play three wrong chords in a row: \"I've seen pigs die with more dignity\" is what I tell them. Then I completely fluff the intro to \"Stop This City\" and go steaming through \"Tread Water\" with only the flimsiest of connections to the backing track. Stamp on the fuzztone (See? This is what becomes of your Acoustic Night!) It goes down a treat, not least with Stevie G, who can't believe I just did a De La Soul number. Well, he has got a point. <p/> There follows a swift pack-up and soon we are all back in Andy's motor, speeding towards NN1 and the Racehorse. For while the Oakley Arms closes at 10:30 of a Sunday evening, our Abington Square headquarters will be continuing to trade until midnight. We arrive in time to see Eaglehead lurch into a mighty rendition of \"Who Do You Love?\" with one Curtis E. Johnson gusting on electric slide guitar. Then it's all round to Jamie Jab's gaff for more beer. Marvellous. A grand night out. <p/> Note: Readers who have spotted \"repeats\" in the set tonight should take comfort: the plan for having an entirely different set at each Masters Of Budvar night still holds good.

Later, inspired by the Stone Roses and Throwing Muses, Ramon picked up a guitar and started writing songs. <p/> Today he plays hypnotically beautiful music with shimmering, clean guitars and atmospheric keyboard washes. Signed to the painfully cool Fishsoup Records (run by Bic Hayes, the \"other\" Pet Shop Boys guitarist), Ramon has recently completed his first album with ace producer Choque Hosein of Black Star Liner at the controls. For fans of modern European songwriting and ambient chill-out alike. <p/> For a sneak preview, try to imagine a blissed-out Curtis E. Johnson crossed with the most extravagantly melancholic moments of early Roxy Music; it might give you a bit of a headache, but you won't be far off the mark. Gorgeous, at any rate, and worth seeing before the Meeja get ahold of him and drive him up out of our price range! <p/> Supporting Ramon will be Northampton's own Spittle Rattle. SpitRat mainman Michael Holloway is a veteran of the wild scene down at Slurps in the nineties and is widely admired around town as a master of cracked folk-blues ballads. He has also played in Germany, Switzerland and France. Accompanying himself on guitar and backed up by Paul Williams (Ubu Swirl) on bass, he delivers a set of depth, intensity and granite-black gallows humour. Fans of Jeff Buckley, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Nick Drake, the Velvets and Spiritualised should make this a date. As should you. <p/> Opening the bill is Pat Fish (The Jazz Butcher/Wilson) continuing his bizarre project of revising his back catalogue in a psychedelic karaoke style.

Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your thing. But you have to stand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst yourself with joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one. <p/> There are some distant FX guitar touches and the lightest of electronic suggestions.

If you like Neil Young, Kevin Ayers or early Bob Dylan, you're in luck. <p/> Reviews for Jesse Morningstar's last album, My Place In The Dust: <blockquote> MORNING STAR<br/> My Place in the Dust <p/> On My Place in the Dust, Morning Star delivers a dizzying collection of night music that would be comparable to a Morrissey Greatest Hits album if his work were half as accomplished. The album is the brainchild of Bristol native Jesse Vernon, who is backed by Jim Barr and John Baggott of the brilliant Portishead. Together, their songs place soul-rousing writing inside of atmospheres drawn from a Tom Waits dream of the afterlife. Never once flinching into pop accessibility, the album flows on a cloudy drone that peaks during the stellar fuzz of \"This is For You\" and ends with the rousing \"Keepers of the Fire.\" So while the nu-crooner revolution may not exactly be at hand, My Place in the Dust at least makes a good case for it. <p/> By Matt Charlton<br/> Exclaim Magazine - June 4, 2003 </blockquote> and <blockquote> MORNING STAR<br/> My Place in the Dust (D7/Dep) <p/> Produced by PJ Harvey and Sparklehorse collaborator John Parish, and assisted by Portishead's Jim Barr and John Baggott, Bristol's Morning Star (aka Jesse D. Vernon) connects classic '60s suave with the roots amalgam. Vernon's soft, subtle croon shuffles along with his slick, finger-snapping cool, with acoustic guitar, horns and strings lounging alongside lashings of flute, organ and accordion. Elsewhere, saloon blues and twangy ballads mix with echo-laden easy listening and ambient choirs, and all the loose ends and potentially disparate styles are beautifully wrapped up in a soft-focus shadowland. 8/10 <p/> By Lorraine Carpenter<br/> Montreal Mirror - May 1, 2003 </blockquote>"},{"gigtext_id":467,"datetime":"2004-08-06","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Once again a fine evening at the Labour. Almost too fine, in fact. Andy and I set up the PA and soundchecked the bands in blazing summer heat. Even as we did, it crossed our minds that nobody in their right mind would want to spend and evening like this crammed into a small club like ours. It would just be too uncomfortable. <p/> All preparations made, we took <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a>, Jesse Morningstar and his rhythm section for dinner, a brief moment of calm during which we ate tortelloni, learned important things about our guests and worked the Rizla accordingly. On our return to the Labour Club, we were disheartened to see that our fears had come true. There were about 8 people in the room, 6 of whom looked as though the last thing they needed was a dose of live music. <p/> Twelve minutes later the room was full. <p/> Joe was first up. His guitar sound is fuller and fatter than ever before, and it proved a worthy magic carpet on which to ride. With his smart new fabrics and classy, confident performance, Joe had the punters sitting up and paying attention to just how much he has been improving as a performer over the past few months. <p/> Curtis E. Johnson simply arrived in the building, sat down, plugged in and started. Plenty of classic originals, delivered on electric guitar in a brash, no-nonsense style. A version of The Cockroach That Ate Cincinatti really got things stirred up, before our hero was joined onstage by Psychedelic Terry Walpole (The Only One Of Its Kind) for a raging rendition of the Incredible String Band's \"Dear Old Battlefield\". Against all the odds, the unlikely trichological twosome brought it off large-style and left the stage to warm applause. <p/> Then a boy with looks like Buddy Holly and a voice like John Lennon takes the stage, toting a tiny nylon-string classical guitar. The first number (during which, I must confess, I managed to leave the introductory music still playing through the poor bastard's foldback!) was halting and a more than a little on the gloomy side. Them natives was restless. But as soon as the unwanted accompaniment was removed from the monitors, Jesse and his band began to weave real magic. Soul, gospel, folk and blues all passed through their ever-so-slightly wonky West Country culture filter, gradually drawing the audience in until they were grinning like fools. Their skills and inventiveness left people breathless as they showed just what a wide range of colours three individuals can conjour at one gig. An inspired version of \"Tighten Up\" secured an away win for the plucky Bristolian beatniks, and from then on it was disbelieving grins all the way, as Jesse and his boys layed encore after encore upon a delirious crowd. <p/> Needless to say, the evening ended in moronically good-natured mayhem and Spanish champagne at Shakespeare Villas. <p/> Jesse exceeded everybody's expectations. Next month we're featuring a really exciting band from Leeds called The Echo Chamber.

Kraftwerk meet the Beach Boys in a Detroit warehouse and decide to cover a few Elevators tunes. No, really... <p/> Influenced by both deep house and deep guitar psychedelia, the Lewis brothers mix clean, driving dance music beats with fat guitars and beautiful, lush melodies. Having grown up in the same Northamptonshire village as Mark Refoy and the legendary Studio Morocco, where the Spacemen 3 recorded some of their earliest demos, Ben and Andy Lewis relocated to Leeds a few years ago. Here they hooked up with the very wonderful Choque Hosein (FunDaMental / Black Star Liner) who produces their ever-growing catalogue of tunes. Over the last few months they have played across the North, including an appearance at In The City in Manchester. Currently there are a good few record companies sniffing around The Echo Chamber. After their appearance at Masters of Budvar they will go on to play their first London dates. Their star is in the ascendant, so this should be just the right time to catch them - for free, of course. <p/> Our second guest tonight is the profoundly strange and oddly endearing Syd Meats, a singer-songwriter of the old school who has long held the title of Southampton's Leading Weird Bloke. Not to worry, though: Syd's wry observational tunes and disturbingly methodical flights of lyrical fancy are delivered with sweet and tuneful backing. One of his tunes has just been covered by gratuitously musical stand-up comedian Boothby Graffoe on his new album. Oh - and make sure you demand Syd's version of \"Common People\". It really isn't the same as all the others, it really isn't. <p/> Opening the bill is Northampton's own Pat Fish. The songwriting power behind the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy and Wilson will be making quasi-digital karaoke whoopsie-daisie once again, this time giving a good old mauling to his 1984 album, A Scandal In Bohemia. <p/> The beer is cheap, the vibe is sweet, the PA clean, the speeches short. Masters of Budvar. You know it makes sense. <p/> <b>Who is Syd Meats ?</b> <p/> <blockquote> Syd Meats first came to the public's attention as a topical songster on BBC Radio Lincolnshire, providing freshly composed ditties every Friday night during 1989 and 1990. <p/> In the early 90's he formed the surreal band Meet The Vicar whose 1991 album \"The Truth About Pork\" contained such gems as \"You're So Indifferent You Probably Think This Song Might Be About You\". <p/> Solo projects have included a one man show \"Meats Saves The Planet\" and the acclaimed \"Revenge of The Sponge Fingers\" album. Cover versions of his songs recorded by Boothby Graffoe and Antonio Forcione have recently been receiving airplay, adding bemused Americans and Radio 4 listeners to the audience for this material. <p/> He is probably best described as a singer-songwriter of (mainly) humorous songs, but he is hard to categorise even when you have seen his act. To quote Syd, \"I sing songs in English accompanied by acoustic guitar\", and that is exactly what he does. <p/> For up-to-the-minute information on Syd's activities, visit <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.sydmeats.co.uk\" target=\"new\">www.sydmeats.co.uk</a> </span><!-- artist_website --> </blockquote> <p/> <b>Quotes from the Media</b> <blockquote> <p/> \"Uncategorisable, and all the better for it\" -Viewpoint Arts, Southampton. <p/> \"Grabs the subject matter by the throat and tramples it into the ground\" - Brian Hinton (author of various music biographies). <p/> \"A walking perverse rhyming dictionary\" -BBC Radio Lincolnshire. <p/> \"Far Too Serious is one of the best songs on the album - an engrossing story which bursts with raptures of hilarity\". <p/> Independent Online Magazine Review, referring to a Syd Meats song which appears on Boothby Graffoe's \"Wot Italian\" album. </blockquote>"},{"gigtext_id":511,"datetime":"2004-09-03","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Hi - Me again, this time with a few words about last Friday night. <p/> It seems to be becoming something of a regular pattern, albeit not one that is too good for my mental health: every time I bring my headliners back from their tea, the Labour Club is practically empty...and every time, fifteen minutes later, the place is full. It's as if the audience have all just pulled up outside in some big old charabanc. It might be the lovely weather we've been having, I suppose. Maybe I'll get used to it. <p/> Whatever, there were plenty of folks there to see me start up my set with a last-minute rendition of Out Of Touch, inspired partly by Mark Refoy's sending me a lovely photograph that he had taken recently of the Fishcotheque by night (yes, still going strong), and partly by Terry Walpole telling me how he had just picked up an American edition cassette of the Fishcotheque album for 79 pence in an Oxford charity shop. (He wuz robbed.) I do so enjoy shouting \"Welcome to folk club\" over a fat Fun Lovin' Criminals sample. Then I felt it was time for a nice sea shanty, so we had My Desert, rapturously greeted by a disbelieving Refoy. Onwards through the ill-advised Scandal In Bohemia stuff: a well-received Southern Mark Smith and a fairly chaotic Real Men. Then a couple of covers and I'm done. Thanks everybody, you made it nice and easy for me. I enjoyed it a lot. <p/> Syd Meats was feeling the love too: he tells me that the audience at Masters of Budvar is easily better than the one at Lincoln Prison. (Better looking too, one kinda hopes.) Alone with his guitar, Syd launched bravely into his first number, cocked it up almost immediately and restarted before anybody had quite figured out what the hell was going on. As he pointed out, his songs are short, but that just means you get more of them! Syd sailed through a set of lovely originals, perhaps the finest of which is the gorgeous \"Walking Sideways\", and still found time to lay that special version of Common People on the crowd. You know, the one that goes \"You'll never be like Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po.\" <p/> Back to the digital stuff, then. The Echo Chamber were up next, stirring up hyperactive house beats with lush, heavily-delayed electric guitar and sweet vocal melodies. They started with their \"theme tune\", In Love With The City, then rushed through a thirty minute set that was crammed with wide-eyed psychedelic pop invention. Faced with demands for an encore, they pleaded that they didn't have any more material ready to play. No problem. We just made them play something a second time, and this time there was dancing.They brought copies of their very first single with them (it's a double a-side featuring 6am and Good Times, and it's available from the Wrong Crowd Recording Company, fact fans), which sold well after the show. And I'm chuffed to bits that the copy they slipped me turned out to be numbered 001. Cheers, gentlemen, nice touch. The Echo Chamber are on their way, and I only hope that we can still find a way to afford them in the future. <p/> So another cracking night at the Labour, and a nice garden party afterwards. <p/> Next month we have some real, bona-fide pop stars coming to play, in the form of Gerard Langley and Rodney Allen of the Blue Aeroplanes. In support we have Northampton songstress Bee Church and that suave gentleman of the road, Paul Cox. <p/> Don't miss it, now."},{"gigtext_id":506,"datetime":"2004-09-12 16:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"1:00 'til 6:00 in the afternoon CAN / Tom Hall Memorial <p/>Cricket for all knockout trophy 2004 Wilson will be playing in The Ken Turner Room."},{"gigtext_id":507,"datetime":"2004-09-12 16:00:00","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Wilson meet The Police <p/> It's an overcast Sunday afternoon in Northampton. At the Cricket Club they are staging the first Tom Hall Memorial Cricket-for-All Challenge Tournament. In Abington Park there is a Gay Pride knees-up with bands and stuff. I am sitting in an otherwise empty Racehorse bar, my Burns in my lap, struggling to free the ball end of a broken 10 string from the body of the guitar. Normally this is a process for which I would employ the tiny allen-key in my gig bag, but right now my gig bag is at the Cricket club, helping to set up the PA. So, in need of some other slender but purposeful pokey item, I seize a 46 string and start to push away with that. Ninety seconds later, the 46 is trapped in the hole every bit as irredeemably as the 10. I'm sitting in the middle of a pub at two o'clock in the afterbloodynoon with this guitar in my lap, with wayward bits of wire poking out of it in all directions. Looks like it's going to be one of those days. <p/> Misery collects me and my kit from the pub and we drive up to the Cricket Club. Inside Bot and Jamie Jab have made a marvellous job of setting up the PA. Everything is in readiness. But where are the drums? With Agent Cooper on holiday in Turkey, we had understood that Mr. Fletcher was keen to seize his opportunity to play with Wilson. We'd been a bit nonplussed when he didn't show for rehearsal on Friday night. \"A bit cocky\" was the general verdict at the time; but Mr. Fletcher is a proper musician, and we figured that as long as we were ready, he would hardly mess things up that much. <p/> We hadn't figured on a no-show. \"A bit cocky\" is swiftly revised to read \"Bottled it.\" Stevie G makes threats of violence, as is his way. I'm left pondering the point of saying \"yes\" to something when what you really mean is \"I can't.\" I don't think I'll ever get my head round it. <p/> No. N-O. Only got two letters, only takes a second to say it. <p/> Thanks, Chuck D, for putting it quite so well. <p/> So we have a large, empty space in the middle of the stage area. This corresponds in a rather sublime manner with the vast empty space that is the rest of the room. Outside a game of cricket is taking place. Occasionally a voice breaks out of the PA system - commentating! <p/> Something else we hadn't figured on. The man who invited us to play said that we could play any time that suited us. We had figured on 4 o'clock as being as good a time as any. The event is supposed to stop at 6 o'clock, so that seemed to be pitched about right. Gratifyingly, as 4 o'clock nears, a small crowd gathers in the room. <p/> Trouble is this: it has become clear that there is to be no noisy old music while the cricket is being played. Can't be distracting the players, you see, even if we are about a hundred and fifty yards away from them, inside a building. So we are going to have to wait until the cricket is done. The final doesn't finish until six o'clock. When I finally do enter the room to see about playing, I see that 903070202200f that small crowd has given up in despair and gone away again. <p/> Never mind. At the last the cricket players will be there, keen to celebrate their winning the final, right? Well, yes. The trouble is this: the team that has just won the Tom Hall Memorial Cricket For All Challenge Tournament is a team from the Police. (Yes, indeed, that does explain why Curtis was out there on the rainy terraces, cheering desperately for the other side.) So we have perhaps twenty-five people here to see the band and perhaps potentially as many Police. And we have been waiting hours. We've waited in the toilets, we've waited in Curtis' car, listening to - uh - opera, we've waited in the special \"Umpires Only\" room (backstage dumper! \"Hey, Bot - we should do a gig here some time!\"), we've waited like proper waiters. Nuff waiting already, let us play. <p/> The backing track begins to roll, with - appropriately enough - snatches of Police radio. I'm wondering if anybody here recognises his voice. I'm wondering if we're all going to Guantanamo. We start with Play It All Night Long, and there is venom. The programmed beats are coming back at us so hard that my monitor is cracking up. It's a good, solid start. Critters is introduced as a song about nature. I'm sure that no animal noises of any kind were made by anybody. At this point. <p/> We bash our way through Quality People, then Curtis runs on to join in with Istanbul Connection. He's brought his own beer crate with him so that he can reach up to share my microphone, and makes a point of getting down off it between lines, then getting back up again for the next one. He's a proper nuisance, but he's a lovely set of pipeys on him. By now there is a small posse of cricket police sitting at a table at the back, about as far away from the band as you can go, looking well miserable. I have no idea what they can be making of the ensuing Secret Government (you ain't seen me, right?), but then comes the time to play Police Chief. <p/> We set off at a fair old clip, guitars fizzing as MC Bot delivers our touching tribute to the boys who protect and serve. As things warm up, the proud new father takes to the keys on his bullhorn and - behold! - the thing can make police car noises! Naturally enthused, Bot continues to nee-naw his way through the entirety of the tune. As we are happily shouting \"You've got it. We want it. What? Your currency\", a small crocodile of victorious and yet somehow strangely subdued officers make their way out of the room. One of them, noting with his eagle-eyed detective skills that MC Bot might conceivably be taking something resembling the piss, mutters something along the lines of \"cults\" as he leaves. Mind how you go, now. <p/> Wilson rattle on through Buffalo Sniper and Dark Agenda. Just to make a point, like. <p/> With those who are there at the death, it goes down great. Lusty cries of \"You whores!\" greet the intrepid Wilson Four as they slink away from their amplifiers. <p/> Andy Shaw, The Man from CAN, loved it, I'm told. He is a very nice man. He bought me a bottle of Pils and let me shout at the Police at some length and at considerable volume. He also gave us a lovely big bottle of Scotch with our wages. CAN is a charity dealing with drug and alcohol addiction issues. <p/> Yeah, I know. <p/> Thanks to Andy, though, and thanks to Jamie Jab for all his help, and thanks to those who came out to one of the weirdest gigs we've done in a while. <p/> So, chop-chop, ladies n gents - what's next? <p/> Aaaargh!

Their first, self-released album Bop Art acted as a statement of intent, and the band soon landed an album deal with Fire Records of London. After a clutch of increasingly successful releases with Fire, in 1989 the band signed to Ensign Records who brought major label muscle to the promotion of the phenomenal Swagger album, the Sunday Times album of the year. The follow-up Beat Songs, recorded in Los Angeles and released in 1991, garnered further success with the critics and the public alike, and The Blue Aeroplanes continued to tour Europe, North America and Japan throughout the nineties. <p/> At the turn of the century, Langley started his own record label, Art Star, on which the Aeroplanes released their latest and possibly most triumphantly deranged album, Cavaliers, in 2001. The following year Langley released his first solo album, Record Player, revealing his long-standing affection for the underground rock of the seventies alongside the usual high-octane brew of poetry, malice and mayhem. At the time of writing, a new Blue Aeroplanes album has just been completed. <p/> For this exclusive acoustic appearance, Langley will be joined by Blue Aeroplanes guitarist and singer, Rodney Allen. Before joining the Aeroplanes, Rodney was a successful solo artist in his own right, and he still occasionally tours with his own band, the Rodney Allen Experience. Expect a night of wild lyricism and distressed twenty-first century folk music run riot <p/> Opening the show are two talented solo artists from Northampton. <p/> Bee Church is a bright and engaging songstress, who is making her first appearance at Masters of Budvar after successful sets at the Strumpets & Pluckers night at the Racehorse in Northampton and the Deportees Club at the Castle in Wellingborough. <p/> Paul Cox is well-known on the local scene as an acoustic balladeer and man-about-town. His classic original songwriting recently entranced the crowds at Northampton's Balloon Festival. <p/> Masters of Budvar is a monthly live music night at the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1. It takes place on the first Friday of every month and entry is always free of charge. There is a friendly atmosphere, very reasonably priced drinks and the best little sound system in town. For nine months now we have been presenting the cream of Northampton's original musical talent, along with guest artists from London, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Southampton. <p/> It is a night not to be missed for all music lovers. <p/> <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.blueaeroplanes.com\" target=\"new\">www.blueaeroplanes.com</a> </span><!-- artist_website --> <p/> <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.paulmcox.com\" target=\"new\">www.paulmcox.com</a> </span><!-- artist_website -->"},{"gigtext_id":503,"datetime":"2004-10-01","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Mental Friday night, the place was stuffed. We discovered at 4:15 in the afternoon that Bee Church was, in fact, not in Northampton at all, but in Keele University. So Karaoke Bob here filled in, taking the first slot a bit rusty and hoping for the best. There were some puzzled looking faces out there. Perhaps they had heard a word that this was to be a \"properly\" acoustic night. Yes, well, sorry about that, but sometimes the \"properly\" acoustic artist is just to blooming flakey to turn up at their own gigs. Having long ago dispensed with further education, I cobbled together a set out of: <p/> Out of Touch - Jazz Butcher Theme - Ghosts - Shakey - Stop This City - and Tread Water. People responded very kindly. Paul Cox's guitar was sounding splendid through Rodney's little Marshall combo with a line-out to the PA. Really warm and rich and just right. Paul sang hypnotically and I felt that his whole thing tonight had a sort of Spiritualised vibe to it. Not in any derivative way, just in the sort of concentration vibration. Lovely, anyway. Gerard and Rodney were ever so game. They entered right into the spirit of things, unfazed by the venue or the PA or the fact that I forced them to go on straight after \"Good Vibrations\". What was immediately apparent was just how good a rhythm guitarist Rodney Allen really is: tight, bright, energetic and accurate. And, of course, over the top of that, a grown man with a handful of papers spouting inconceivable great gobbets of garbled information, bile, wonderment and wit at breakneck speed. Rodney joining in for the choruses with his rich, warm voice. Oh, and plenty of the old hits too, like Jacket Hangs (the best received tune of the night), Love Come Round, a storming Bury Your Love Like Treasure (some audience participation, possibly, on my part), The Applicant and Yr Own World; alongside odd bits and pieces like Jack Leaves from Beatsongs and even a couple of brand new numbers from the forthcoming Blue Aeropanes album. Rodney delivered a ouple of tunes, one by the Great Paul Mulreaney, and one which - spinechillingly - turned out to be the awesome Disney Head. In the Labour Club. For nothing. <p/> Only time and an increasingly restless Geoff behind the bar put a stop to the fun and games. The crowd wanted more and the talent were keen to lay a version of Tom Verlaine's Breaking In My Heart upon them, but it was not to be. Not this time. Instead it's off to the boozer up the street until one o'clock, thence back to Shakespeare Villas for more foolishness. Members of the Echo Chamber materialise at some deep hour of the night. I know I didn't imagine it. It goes on until dawn. <p/> Next month: The New Moon from Oxford, a modern acoustic trio with double bass; Northampton acoustic star Robert Bray and his circle of disgustingly talented friends; and a third act. It was going to be me, but, having done this month's gig, and having helped myself to the support for the Black Watch on the 22nd October, I think I might remove myself from the November Budvar bill and let somebody else have a go.

A decade on, Transcendental finds him still floating amid Velvet Underground crescendos and twinkling, richly romantic space rock (\"Everything And Anything\"). Graphic novel guru Alan Moore also makes a surprising cameo, reciting Edmund Blunden&rsquo;s poem \"Clare&rsquo;s Ghost\". A far-flung branch on the Spacemen 3/Spiritualized family tree definitely worth investigating. <p/> **** <p/> UNCUT Magazine August 2003 <p/> This album drifts dreamily into the consciousness like a love symphony from beyond the stars equipped with the emotions of loneliness and imprisonment as burdened upon Bowie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Major Tom&rsquo;, yet possessing a subtle essence of 60&rsquo;s West Coast pop in its most potent and purist form. &rsquo;Transcendental&rsquo; is equally warming as it is soft to touch, depth wise it shares a common thread with the Bunnymen&rsquo;s monumental &lsquo;Ocean Rain&rsquo; for simplistic intensity and tender appeal. Weave into that elegant tapestry the insular drone nuances of Spacemen 3&rsquo;s &lsquo;Recurring&rsquo; and Spiritualized&rsquo;s &lsquo;Laser Guided Melodies&rsquo; and you have an album that flutters in a triumphant haze at every given corner. <p/> LOSING TODAY Magazine, August 2003"},{"gigtext_id":472,"datetime":"2004-12-03","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"The Labour Club was packed to bursting on Friday night, both in the room and on the stage area. Somebody walked in to see Ghost Train's array of microphones lined up across the room and, without hesitation, cried \"Ah! Crosby Stills and Nash Live!\" After a night of utter inaudibility at the Racehorse a week or two ago, the plucky cowpokes had decided to embrace the Great Satan of electricity, resulting in this forest of mic stands and an audience which simply chatted away over their music just a little bit louder than usual. They started with a rather gruesome high end feedback ring stalking their every note and such were my fears for their security that I found myself forced to go outside and smoke a fat one in the road. Surprising to relate, on my return to the room, The Train were sounding full, fat and utterly lovely. I trust that this had something to do with them gaining control over their sound problems, rather than the quality of my smoking mixture. Reader, I jest: they sounded lovely indeed and you're not to bury them out on the lone prairie, do you understand? <p/> Superstar DJ Willie Carruthers entertained the swelling crowd with all manner of naughty stuff (when was the last time that you heard the \"Vision On\" theme in a club?) before the arrival of the Short Wave Band. Dressed in a white all-over radiation suit, sporting wraparound dark glasses and a small but powerful electric light attached to an elastic band around his baldy head, clutching a clipboard and ready for action, Curtis E. Johnson (for it was he) set in motion the second and final transmission of the Short Wave Band. Swathed in footage of dying stars on the edge of a distant galaxy, the diminiutive madman unleashed huge, savage waves of concrete sound at the assembled throng. The electronic avant-garde was subjected to the kicking of the month as E-Man manipulated his horrible Alesis Air Synths, stacked up the echo and let the punter deal with the consequences. Two young hepsters, grim-faced and desperate, promptly barged their way out of the club. Unbelievably, the vast majority remained rooted to the spot, watching open-mouthed as the sonic brutality unfolded before them. Arch electronic sound manipulator and friend of Delia Derbyshire, Sonic Boom laughed in disbelief. Welcome to acoustic night. <p/> Superstar DJ Will cranked the music another bluesy notch as the stage was set for the return of Slipstream. With Ray Dickerty sadly unable to join them this evening, Mark Refoy and Jonny Mattock were left to deliver a stunning set of psychedelic pop soul with drums, sequencers, laptop, guitar, organ and vocal harmonies. If that sounds like a pair of flash so-and-soes showing off their dubious skills on a mess of instruments, then I've misled you by accident. These two focussed, dedicated musicians worked effortlessly and with minimal fuss to fill the room with their perfectly balanced, fascinatingly dense and melodic sounds. Their set encompassed tunes from the 2003 Enraptured album \"Transcendental\" as well as brand new tunes yet to be released, for example the sublime \"Burn Till You Die\" which somehow manages to evoke Kraftwerk, Spacemen 3 and cheery mid-seventies yob-rock all at the same time. Jon's drumming had Sonic enthusing wildly, while my eyes barely left the neck of Mark's guitar. Well, you live and learn, do you not? Inevitably, the crowd went nuts and encores were duly delivered, including an incredible version of Joy Division's \"Heart and Soul\" which may or may not have mutated into \"Jingle Bells\" somewhere along the way. No, it must be my fevered imagination. A truly magisterial set in most every way. <p/> The evening finished up with Will spinning more sides while people got really, really twisted. A smashing night: three great acts, four ex-Spacemen and a man from Detroit in a pink satin Budgie Jacket. Masters of Budvar - all right, it doesn't make sense, but you know you need it all the same. <p/> Next month <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> headlines with his band The Moon Children, featuring Rob Bray, Misery Wilson and Sarah Spade among others.

The verdict appears to have been a resounding \"not half!\". The mighty little Labour Club PA punched above its weight once again, the band squeezed itself into the stage area (which we were sharing with a large Christmas Tree!) and we even managed to draft in the celebrated oil wheel in an effort to vibe up the room. Of course, what you really need to vibe up the place is a pack of raving punters, up on their hind legs and baying for dub mayhem, and happily, with tonight seeing the birthday celebrations of both the Great Yvette Bailey and Public Enemy Number One, the right reverend Lindsay Spence, a crowd was soon assembled. A few \"faces\" in there, too, including Mark Refoy, Big Tim Sansom and none other than Laurence O'Keefe, who has been in town working on the feature film \"Kinky Boots\", shortly to put Northampton NN1 on the silver screen, thereby boosting our New Barcelona status to almost painful levels. (Actually, there have been two feature films shooting in town this month, so let's make that really full-on painful, shall we? Lovely!) We played The Temptaions, The Streets and The Kills and Joe Woolley delivered a strong opening set, much to Big Tim's fascination. The Wilson sirens started up with MC Bot nowhere to be seen, but we've got used to this at the Labour Club.

I had anticipated something of a post-festive slowdown, but instead the place was absolutely packed.Perhaps they had all heard Big Tim's new recording on the BBC Weekender. We listened to it huddled together in Big Tim's car outside the club, and it came across truly magnificent. Mark Refoy's production magic clearly in evidence on the brilliant new waxing \"A Prayer For Thee\" - God, it sounds like Roy Orbison! <p/> As usual, Big Tim had to be restrained with steel hawsers before taking the stage before everyone was in the house. Eventually we let him go up there. As the dulcet tones of \"I'm Batman\" by The Marble Tea gently faded out, Big Tim picked up the chords, strummed along and piled straight into the intro to one of his own tunes, an inspired beginning. Standing four-square in front of the swelling crowd, Tim was on fire, barely stopping for breath between one hit and another. A great set. <p/> Minimal fuss as Mrs. Pilgrimm installed herself onstage and tore off into her set. Once again, absolutely inspired. It's not easy to write about Mrs. P's music, because it is so unique. There's just a torrent of mad, mutated and very beautiful cello music, all running at different speeds - indeed, things often go BACKWARDS - with catchy, teasing vocals delivered in a disarmingly direct and intimate fashion. If you want to know more, go to www.mrspilgrimm.de and order her fabulous \"Alone Queen\" album. Thank you. <p/> Despite a few pre-gig concerns, <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> and his band turned in a wonderful set. Robert was magnificent on the drums, Luke warm and solid on electric bass, leaving acres of space for Joe's amped-up, heavily verbed acoustic guitar to spin out soulful psychedelic phrases across the top. Add in the Moonettes with their chorus of back-up vocals and you get a fabulous little late sixties West Coast beat happening, yea even unto the point of an Eight Miles High style feedback wig-out at the end. An encore was demanded and delivered. On went the \"Nouvelle Vague\" version of Guns of Brixton and there you have it for another month. <p/> Thanks to all the artists and all the people who came to see them, thanks to the Labour Club and thanks to the guys at Weekender for their continuing and much-valued support in all this.

An uneventful journey takes us to a small, orange basement beneath the very heart of Oxford. The Cellar used to be part of the wine cellars pof the Oxford Union Society (ooh), on whose lawns Russ, Anita and I later smoke a sneaky spliff. Now it is a groovy wee catacomb with a helpful soundman called Robin. We set up and soundcheck with ruthless efficiency then head off to the house of Matt Sewell, singer of The New Moon, where we are to be fed. <p/> After an interesting van/underground-parking-lot interface we relax in style as Matt and Chrissie regale us with phenomenal quantities of delicious chilli and beer in their calm and lovely flat. Well, as calm as anything with Terry Walpole in it can be... <p/> On the way back to the venue I try to send the entire band the wrong way up St. Giles Street. \"It's probably changed a bit since you were here,\" says Pete. <p/> The New Moon open the show at the faintly ridiculous hour of 8:30. There is already a small crowd, though, which swells throughout their set. Shades of Robin Hitchcock and Jeff Buckley hover around the surprisingly tough sounds that Matt and bassist Ian conjur. The double bass really does give the songs body and drive and Matt is in fine voice. Later they are joined by a man playing a flute. He's very good, but I wouldn't have said they really needed him. <p/> A good crowd has gathered by the time that The Race begin their set. We don't know much about them beyond the fact that they come from Reading, but we do know that they are on a bit of a tour, and we rather suspect that perhaps most of the punters tonight will really be here to see them, not us. (This actually turns out not to be true - I should point out that a lot of them are probably there more for the pound-a-pint deal than for any particular one of the groups.) <p/> The Race start strongly; in tune, powerful, passionate. It's The Big Music. During their first number, which starts off epic and then, rather bravely, just gets bigger and bigger, Russ and I both suddenly realise that they remind us of U2. It's a kind of music that I don't usually like, but they do it with charm and verve, and in a small cellar on a cold night it is very agreeable.The diminiutive frontman, who has a lovely voice, is whacking the shit out himself with his tambourine. I would be surprised if he sits down for a week. Two or three more epics into their set and Terry Walpole is on the dance floor, whirling like a dervish and frightening the natives. Meanwhile MC Bot is in something called The Goat With Three Heads. Russ and Anita and I attempt to go and find this goat, but get no further than the aforementioned lawns of academe. <p/> Soon enough we are on the little stage: the sound is crisp, the house full, the headcase down the front. We play the same set we have played since Steve Bez joined us, and once again it is improved. It really feels good, with Steve Bez and Russ locked into a groove and Kathy good and loud, courtesy of The Race's marvellous bass tractor. Good response from the audience too. They didn't lose interest after The Race after all. Native observers later tell us that for Oxford they were positively animated. <p/> A drink or two and a brief chat with Richard from Gappy Tooth Promotions (he sounded like my kind of guy) and we're stuffing ourselves back into the van, all paid up and packed away. On the trip home we hear somebody on national BBC Radio use the phrase \"celebrating Auschwitz\". Well done, everybody out there in Hollyoaks World. I was wondering how long it would take. <p/> Sincere thanks, though, are due to Matt and Chrissie for their extreme hospitality; to Jimmy Evil for booking us; to The Race for being so easy to work with and for that lovely bass thing; and to Terry Walpole, for it is true that without him the evening would never actually have happened. <p/>"},{"gigtext_id":537,"datetime":"2005-02-04","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Friday 4th February 2005 at The Labour Club, Charles St, Northampton NN1 Masters of Budvar present The Jesse Morningstar Soul Revue featuring the keenly awaited return of Jesse Morningstar and his band, plus a full supporting cast made up of the cream of Bristol's acoustic music scene.

With his first album Foot Of Film now released and garnering warm reviews, Ramon is on his way to big things. For those who missed his performance at Masters of Budvar last summer, Ramon plays an unbelievalbly simple, direct, honest set with acoustic guitar and voice. With these most basic of tools and a catalogue of richly melodic original tunes he charms you into his own parallel universe. Irrational feelings of calm, beauty and warmth are the inevitable result. Could this be the start of the thaw? <p/> Columbus & Crusoe are a highly-rated new ensemble from Wellingborough.

It's so much more than just mood music. Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your thing. But you have to stand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst yourself with joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one. There are some distant FX guitar touches and the lightest of electronic suggestions. It fades deliciously away, leaving a nostalgic and lonesome feeling as piano notes fall like gentle touches of silk. It is beautiful. <p/> It isn't rock and roll, but it could save your love life. Four and a half stars </blockquote> Praise for Ramon's new album, Foot of Film: <blockquote> Foot of Film does not clamour for attention; instead, it draws you in almost imperceptibly with its diet of delicate strummery, patches of melancholy and whimsy and De Juan's pure, beseeching tones.

That's what we want.\"<br/> \"You want the horrible. Okay.\"<br/> <p/> They asked us, so we came. <p/> Our previous attempts to rock the County Cricket Club's spacious Ken Turner Suite have been, shall we say chequered: a somewhat inauspicious wedding party where we were obliged to sing The Stalker Song* in the dark, and a bizarre charity-related afternoon encounter between a drum-free Wilson, their deeply inebriated hardcore supporters and the local Police cricket team. From our limited experience, it seems that you never quite know what's going to happen to you at the Cricket Club. <p/> Still, we had been to the previous Tom Hall Memorial show back in 2003 and that had been a beauty, so we had some reason to hope that this third attempt on the Ken Turner Ice Face might work out. The soundman had all our technical whoopsie-daisy in advance, we were (as advertised) drummed to the hilt. Assuming that anybody turned up, this one ought to be good. <p/> Soundchecking in the afternoon ate right into Doctor Who, so we only just managed to make it back to Stevie G's house in time to see the big blubbery aliens get their faces blown off by a nuclear missile. Bravo! Stevie G serves out the curry! <p/> Moments later, Steve is back out the door, heading back to the festival to play the opening set with Ghost Train. We mill about the house playing the Good Cop Bad Cop album and knocking back the strong continental lagers. It's not long before Steve returns, mortified. Apparently Ghost Train have spent their set imprisoned among a forest of microphone stands, not that these have in any way rendered the band audible. Yes, there are people there. No, he doesn't want to go back there again, if that's all right with us. <p/> Of course, we do all go back down there, quite sharpish, in fact. I think that Steve has awakened our curiosity. We arrive to catch the end of Curtis' set, then we settle in and lay about the generous backstage spread while watching Pete Garofalo and Sue Figuoera front a band doing Tom Hall songs, rather well as it goes. But my, it is quiet. I take to telling anybody who will listen that my guitar amplifier is louder than all that lot up there put together. I do this because I am becoming nervous. I am becoming nervous because I cannot imagine what will happen when we get up there with our horrible loud music. <p/> Sara Spade comes on and delivers a lovely set, during which I discover that Steve Beswick and Ian Anderson have taken strategic control of the best public toilet in the county. Soap! Paper towels! No wonder they are guarding the doorway so carefully. <p/> And then we are on. And nobody throws anything. Nothing breaks. Nobody does anything stupid. We just play and shout and it all works perfectly. Everybody has a good time. Curtis keeps running up to deliver odd little vocal whoopsie-daisies. People thrashing about down the front, all that stuff. A good time is had by all (of us, anyway) and I don't see a single person with their hands over their ears. We even get to play our planned - inevitable - encore of \"Hippy Shit\". <p/> Wilson finally get a positive result at the Cricket Club and the Phippsville Festival is a big success all round.

Fishy blames Big Tim Sansom (a spurious excuse, if ever there were one) and careers off into a karaoke set, crashing into the wall about twenty minutes later with a rendition of De La Soul's \"Tread Water\". <p/> This is Peter Crouch's first ever solo show, so he has sent for moral support and recruited the aforementioned Eider to play his lovely old Gretsch while a seated Crouchy sings and plays acoustic rhythm. Max starts a little quiet, but, once he hits the right level, he provides a beautiful lush accompaniment to Crouchy's acid-tongued chronicles of intercontinental anguish and despair. It's fun to hear him playing Crouchy's own lead lines from the recordings too. Altogether it's an inspired pairing: elegant, world-weary, darkly tuneful and quite mesmerising. We want this back again. <p/> Wearing a baseball cap and a fat old semi-acoustic that could almost give Max's Gretsch a run for its money, accompanied by assorted odd little bits of machinery and the dapper German jazz bassist Rainer, Wolfgang Tschegg returns to Northampton Town. He opens up with one of my favourite tunes, \"Helicopter\", then makes brief introductions before setting up the mutated bossanova beat for \"Mann aus den Bergen\", one of the loveliest tunes on his new album. Next comes a choppy little number called Mustang: \"And if you ask yourself do I mean the car or the horse...it doesn't matter. Both are cool.\" By this stage of the game Wolfgang and Rainer are really grooving, and although their singing in German makes them a touch impenetrable, the audience are starting to get it too. Me, I'm sitting right in front of the stage, so happy I could...well, never mind what I could do. Wolfgang is giving that guitar a good going over. \"Yeah, yeah - all right!\" Then into the cool ballad \"Das Haus\" and \"Dunkel\" (\"It's a little bit dark, but not very dark\") complete with harmonica solo before the recorder apocalypse that heralds the new single \"Tarzan Sagt\" (Yes, \"Tarzan Says\", that's right...) There is a touching version of \"Winter Kompakt\" before Rainer takes gamely to the electric piano for \"Superhimmel\". There is a supremely far-out droney thing called \"Das Schiff\" (\"It's a space ship\") with some outrageous bendy bass playing, all of which has people cheering like fools and baying for more, so we are graced with a kicking, souped-up \"Sonnenmaedchen\" to conclude. It was all unspeakably beautiful. So I shall speak of it no more, save to offer my heartfelt thanks to Wolfgang and Rainer for coming and doing that in our club. <p/> Back at Shakespeare Villas we enjoyed another fine afterhours set from <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a>, whose CD was promptly seized by Rainer for further investigation back in Berlin.

On the stereo we played New Order, Can, Anthony and the Johnsons, Rolo McGinty's Bad Apples CD and more besides, but that's not really what I meant. After a month or two away, the funny coloured lights made a welcome return to action, and we had that black stuff hanging up all over the walls and the windows, with big old electric fans blowing every whichway. That's not it either, though. <p/> At about 9:15 three young men take to the corner of the room which, with an arch and knowing wink, we call \"the stage\". These men, for a whom a small and painfully hip crowd has gathered, are none other than Elk Force. Now, I believe that in my advertising spiel I might possibly have caused some inadvertent distress to Elk Force's hip-hop kingpin Scott by implying that The Force might in some way prove difficult or...I think the word was \"harrowing\". As he himself put it: <p class=\"annotation\"> \" We honestly didn't know we were traumatic, terrifying and troublesome. We always thought we were more of a mildly left wing pop outfit for the mtv generation. (that was the idea anyway). Just for the record, we in no way support chairman mao - He was a very bad man whose presence still seems to loom large and overshadow China - It's time China faced up to this and moved on.\" </p> But of course. <p/> To be fair, the Hinterhoff label's latest hopefuls had, since recording their inital manifesto, focussed their - shall we say? - sonic maelstrom with the clever addition of drummer Ben Jackson, last seen round these parts with Saab 77. With Ben driving things along with force and precision, it was easier to follow the intricate and ever-so-slightly mental patterns that Scott and Richard weave with their guitars. Great lyrics well delivered. It's a shame that tune about the Jesus Centre doesn't go on a bit longer. Remix, anybody? <p/> This was the first appearance of Elk Force and they played really well. By the end of the night it was hard to find a punter not proudly sporting their Elk Force button badge. I have no idea as to whether these people are going to do more of this, and I've no idea how to describe what they do. I still think they're mental, but I can see how they might not appear that way to people who listen to modern post-rock type stuff. Somewhere to the left of Pavement, perhaps. (I know nothing about that kind of music. Shows, doesn't it?) <p/> Swiftly following The Force came Rosie Wilby accompanied by Kontra Band's Al Tate on bass and Paul de Gallier on percussion. A much more melodic proposition, the trio made the most of the club sound system with a warm, deep sound that made a perfect setting for Rosie's singing. Still reeling from Glastonbury, Rosie even took on the swelling crowd of hepsters on her own, singing the most delicate ballad imaginable. There is an awful lot of songwriting savvy at work here, choruses that just fall right out at you, like that one on You Amaze Me, which gets stuck in my damn head all the time. And check out Guitar Rosie - she knows all the chords. A warm, assured showing; just the thing for just that moment, really. <p/> When the Telescopes arrived for a soundcheck I was surprised to see that they showed no interest in any of the microphones set up around the stage and that they didn't really seem to have anything that they wanted to plug into the PA. All these charming types from Burton On Trent really seemed to want was tables. As many tables as you've got, really, thanks. Brilliant. On these tables Steven and Lorin set up guitars and various devices which they employ to coax sounds from these guitars. They effectively operate on the instruments, like surgeons. Instead of scalpels they employ ball-bearings, violin bows, portable electric fans, crocodile clips and a seven inch tall metal robot. All of which goes off into a bewildering array of outboard hardware for treatment before barreling on out the amplifiers at you, the punter. Jo, meanwhile, sits on her amp, big old 335 in her lap, rapt in concentration. <p/> By the time the Telescopes were taking to the stage it had crossed my mid that I might as well try to use the three microphones to some effect, so in a homage to the Telescopes' erstwhile producer Rich Formby, I pottered around \"sort of\" setting up the mics to pick up amps and ambience and broadcast same through the PA. To be honest, I wish I'd done it all a bit louder. <p/> The Telescopes start their set with a lush drone, centred around the soporific beat of a needle spinning on an empty record deck. The drone builds, changes texture, swells, recedes. The surgeons are hard at work on their instruments, heads down. Jo's head is down too. When once she glances up into the crowd it is with a look of icy determination that could stop a speeding truck. People are staring open-mouthed. No beat comes crashing in, no vocal emerges; only the most abstract wisps of melody, conjured from the very effect of the different constituent elements of the drone moving cyclically/seismically together and apart. Some people, it has to be said, are becoming impatient. Most are very quiet. I'm bloody riveted, me. <p/> After who-knows-how-long the initial drone starts to fade and an electronic ghost of a beat begins to pulse beneath the soundscapes. They're into Phase Two of their set and things are getting a touch polarised. There are people actually leaving. Well, it's Friday night and maybe this isn't what they'd bargained for and that's fair enough. Meanwhile back on Planet X, the Telescopes continue to sculpt and shape their noise to great effect. When finally, after about 45 minutes of utterly beautiful music, they achieve a graceful landing, those who have taken the ride along with them give genuinely warm and appreciative applause. With good reason. This is not the sort of thing that you see every day. In fact, the last time I can recall being at a gig like this was the Spacemen's evening of contemporary sitar music at the Watermans Art Centre in Brentford. Frankly and fortunately, the atmosphere tonight doesn't come close to the chilly miasma of misunderstanding, suspicion and thinly-veiled hostility that characterised the event that launched the Dreamweapon. No, China has moved on, so instead it's trebles all round and back to Masters of Budvar Secret Headquarters for afters.

Far from stuck in a 1960s time warp, he recalls Woodstock psychedelia with the wry humour of a man who knows that getting wasted and writing songs about hamburgers falling in love with hotdogs is a novelty that just won't last. <p/> Still, he doesn't regret one moment of it, and neither do we as his awesome, and at times ridiculous, gravelly blues and traditional union chants float into the night air, reminding Northampton that there's a vintage you can't buy on Camden High Street. And The Fish has it, down to a T.\" </div>"},{"gigtext_id":529,"datetime":"2005-08-05","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Masters of Budvar present <p/> -at- <p/> The Labour Club, Northampton NN1 <p/> Friday 5th August 2005 <p/> COLUMBUS & CRUSOE <p/> Rising young band from Wellingborough with a uniquely chilled English sensibility and lots of mad little instruments. A welcome return to Masters of Budvar for this intriguing young band from Wellingborough. <p/> Chilled, English and elegant is their thing. Their songs have a wide-eyed innocence that sits well with their lovely melodies and fullsome arrangements. Last time they appeared as a duo - this time it will be the full band.

Come and enjoy them. <p/> ANTON BARBEAU <p/> Standing in heroically at the last minute to cover for a sadly unavailable Big Tim, the Sacramento mentallist returns to Master of Budvar with more of his crazed, irony-drenched stadium folk. Must be seen to be believed, people. <p/> SPITTLE RATTLE <p/> Michael Holloway's cracked and twisted Nene Delta blues. Nice sound, pretty lights, cheap drinks, great atmosphere. The enlightened Masters of Budvar strike another blow for proper entertainment. Under this none-more-black handle Michael Holloway practices his own unique style of cracked, demented urban blues. This solo set promises to be compelling stuff. <p/> It's all free, of course, lovely sound, lovely retro lighting, lovely Czech beer, lovely people. <p/> Assume that the first artist will be on stage at 9:00 o'clock and you can't go wrong.

A large silver station wagon packed to the gunnels with boxes of black and chrome slides stealthily along a quaint country lane. Two faintly desperate looking men in sunglasses are in the front, their windows wound fully down, as though the day were much sunnier than it is. From those windows comes a cloud of acrid smoke and the unmistakeable roar of Killing Joke's mighty Asteroid. The first wave has almost made it to Security Checkpoint One. <p/> On the floor of the Nene Valley some twelve miles east of Northampton lie the Grendon Lakes. The place is a local beauty spot, popular with fishermen, families and - on occasion - with the more hardcore element of the Racehorse regulars. There is a nice little club house there with a bar, restaurant and all the facilities you could want. A pleasant little patio looks out over the water. <p/> Because of the eponymous lakes, somebody has had the bright idea of staging an extreme sports event here: wakeboarding, skateboarding, BMX, all that sort of thing. Air 05 is to be a three day event with live music, DJs, camping, all that good shit. Wilson have been invited to play the first evening, so here we are, about half a mile off the main road, waiting in a short line of vehicles queuing to clear security. Agent Wilson and I are impressed to see that the people checking the vehicles are in paramilitary garb, some with helmets and goggles. They do take their time, though. It must have something to do with the large and immobile Winnebago parked up about three ahead of us. Eventually we announce ourselves as Wilson: The First Wave and are tooled up with the requisite paperwork to proceed to Security Checkpoint Two. We continue down the track towards the lakes, wondering how many people are going to be queuing up at that gate later in the weekend. <p/> Checkpoint Two succumbs easily to the glamour of our new paperwork and in a minute or two we are pulling up outside the clubhouse. As we load in Rob from The Buzz is at the controls. playing groovy punk, soul and dub sounds to perhaps two or three dozen people milling about on the patio or down by the lake, where the wakeboarders are warming up. Russ tools me up with some fags and leaves me to set up as much kit as I can while he sets off back to NN1 to fetch the Second Wave. Rob Carter buys me a pint of Stella. It is 4:00pm. <p/> At a picnic table high on a hill above the lake under a leaden sky they sit, crow-like. Wilson, minus MC Bot but plus Anita Allbright and her small Soviet flask of brandy, huddle together, safe in the knowledge that a soundcheck has finally been completed. A few last shafts of sunlight break through the looming clouds. Red sky at night: shepherd's delight. Red sky in the morning: nuclear war. <p/> We watch the wakeboarders still practising in the fading light. They are getting air all right. It is radical, possibly gnarly even. Stevie G decides that he wants to see some mishap action. Each time one of the talented aquatic daredevils comes speeding by, Steve cries with a passionate intensity: \"Foot off!\" <p/> A tall, dark figure is coming up the hill towards the picnic table. It is unsteady on its feet and it is gesticulating wildly in a manner that we cannot fully understand. It is MC Bot and he feels like getting naked. Somebody asks what time it is. It is eight o'clock. We are on at ten o'clock. A sort of desperate hilarity breaks out. <p/> I miss the first band on the bill. Rob Carter reckons that they did Stone Roses songs in a Norfolk accent: \"The Alan Partridge Project\". Mind you, Rob Carter is off his face. They seemed like perfectly decent people to me. I wobble off and sit by the peaceful water's edge. Rob Carter plays Crazy Horses by the Osmonds. While I am still reeling from this, he wanders out of the clubhouse and finds me at the water's edge: \"Oi, Buckley - No!\" <p/> The second band are very competent and are going down very well with the ten or twelve people who have actually gone into the clubhouse. This is not entirely the band's fault. The room is small and the PA is very large indeed. Those who are in the room are literally pinned along the back wall. This does not, however, sink in at the time. Somehow I reckon it will be different for us. Had you asked me where I thought all the people were coming from, I might have gone a bit quiet, though. <p/> From the moment we take the stage it is chaos. We are really, really loud. MC Bot is really, really off it and really, really up for it at the same time. The stage doesn't even hold him until the first chorus. He's out there. Those who weren''t already pinned against the back wall by the volume are now cowering there in the hope that the crazy singer man's microphone lead won't reach that far. It does, though. Nobody is safe. With Bot spending most of his time in front of the PA, the filthy racket that we are already generating becomes wholesomely larded with swathes of mid-range feedback. The band is playing its teeth out. It's murder. <p/> There is so little room on the stage that I stay pretty much immobile, head down, getting on with it as best I can. I miss lots of what is going on. By the end I pretty much assume that we have cleared the place. So as everyone leaves the stage I get down on the floor and make with a little bit of delay feedback. As the other sounds die away I start to reduce the level, then slow it down to sound like a record slowly running out of speed. It takes ages. I am certain that nobody is paying the slightest attention. As finally I fade the feedback out to silence, for a second you can hear a pin drop. Then about three young girls burst into keen applause. Bless 'em, I think, they were waiting for the ending. A few people come up and say very polite things. Rob Carter reckons it was fantastic. Did I mention that Rob Carter is off his face? <p/> By midnight we are speeding back through the Northamptonshire country lanes, heading for Agent Wilson's. Running the performance back in my head I simply cannot see how we are going to play the Balloon Festival tomorrow without getting fully and comprehensively arrested."},{"gigtext_id":525,"datetime":"2005-08-20 17:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"In a move calculated to cause anxiety and stress across the nation, Wilson will be appearing at the Northampton Balloon Festival on Saturday 20th August. <p/> Not exactly the sort of event at which you would expect to find us, perhaps, but it's all the work of Jon and Griff at the BBC Radio Northampton Weekender. <p/> For that Saturday only they are taking control of the big stage at the Barrack Road end of the Racecourse (where Desmond Dekker played that fantastic set last year) and presenting a bunch of local bands who feature on their show. It's not one of their live outside broadcast affairs (too risky - Wilson are on, you know), but they are planning on recording the event and broadcasting the best bits on later editions of the Weekender. <p/> As well as Wilson, the event features Joe Woolley and his band (featuring our own, dear Misery), Visionstate, One Toy Soldier and Northampton Town's latest Fierce Panda signings, Atlantic Dash.

Happily Julie Reinger and the Weather Prophets have got it badly wrong. Deluge there is none. It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood. The first thing we find as we enter the backstage compound is the Mystic Crew, which is a good way to start. Northampton's finest original reggae rockers have the slot before ours this afternoon, but right now the Drake Music Project are onstage. They are an extraordinary band, made up entirely of some pretty severely disabled people. With keyboards and percussion they are weaving a mad, precise and rather beautiful sort of mutated sixties soundtrack samba sound. It's like nothing you have ever heard. See them if you get the chance; you won't believe what's going on in front of you. <p/> By the time the Second Wave has arrived, there is something even stranger up there on the stage. In my weakened condition I am astonished to see a seven foot high giant panda in a bright red satin Fun Manchu gown cavorting with an equally massive dog, a bear in dungarees and a huge koala in a yellow t-shirt with a map of Australia on it. They go into a frenzied dance routine to a song about somebody (one them, I can only guess) having a birthday. This also is like nothing you have ever seen. It is wrong, distressing and horribly seductive. Ah, the lure of plush - perhaps it is as well that Stevie G is not with us today. A nice holiday in the wholesome seaside air of beautiful Pembrokeshire will surely be better for the poor man's head. Meanwhile, I am trying to figure how I can get my hands on the panda outfit. Then I have to have some beer. Quickly. <p/> The relentless positivity and family-friendliness of the acts onstage has completely vaporized my head. What are we doing here with our songs about cancer, corruption and war? When a nice man comes out and announces the Mystic Crew with a spiel that involves the words \"positive sunshine vibrations\" I teeter on the edge of panic. <p/> Happily, the Crew are positive in all the right ways. Dennis on the bass sounds huge and he's playing a blinder. With both Robbie and Zebby onstage the Mystics are blessed with two really charismatic, tuneful front men, which really gets the crowd involved. Nothing too mental, mind, all solid, melodic stuff, beautifully delivered. Though I don't know if I'll ever get my head around the version of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" ...however much of an improvement it is on the original. <p/> The really good news is that all this reggae music is sounding fantastic through the big old outdoor PA. Somebody out there is clearly well on top of their job. This we find reassuring. We head backstage to assemble our kit, just in time to find our old friend Ruby the red bus pulling in with Jonny Mattock at the wheel and a well-dressed but not entirely stable Joe Woolley on board. Out of the van he comes. Over he goes. Later tonight I will find him being carried, unconscious, down the stairs on the back of Agent Wilson. Griff from the BBC Weekender comes by and asks how it went at Air 05 last night. \"Chaos, mate. Like the Stooges' last ever gig,\" I tell him with a rueful smile. I can feel the bravery radiating off him. All his artist are belong out control. <p/> Mystic Crew finish their set to warm applause, then there are a fairly frantic fifteen minutes of moving shit about, plugging shit in and generally sorting shit out. At 5:30 the DJ shuts down and that's it: we're on. The first sound that can be heard is a police radio, dubbed up to the eyes, floating out over bewildered balloon festival families. There are, to our delight, little knots of mates out there in the crowd. Also there is Holly. As the instruments kick in and we realise that, yes, we can more or less all hear each other on this whopping great stage, it's all set. If only the very first line of the song wasn't \"Grandpa pissed his pants again\"... <p/> Bot and I are on our best behaviour. This grandpa did him pants instead. Still, it doesn't change the fact that we are starting with a tune about incest, madness, sickness and death. I'm missing Steve, me. I feel like I'm too loud and exposed on my stupid ostrich guitar. I'm wondering if we might be needing to dig deep to find a little something extra this afternoon when something comes to pass. <p/> As the first chorus hits I look to my right and there is Curtis, craning to shout harmoniously down my microphone. No milk crates being available, the stage crew sort him out with his own microphone and - behold - we are six once again. The return of Mister E. Wilson! Curt stalks the stage, vibing things up a treat. There are enough Wilson heads in the audience to get something going and the whole set starts to roll rather nicely. Ash and Rhiannon from the Racehorse are down the front, arms in the air, rocking it properly. Holly wants to hear that song about bananas, but we play Police Chief instead. It's not the vicious maelstrom of last night, which is probably all to the good. It's measured and right and what we lose from Stevie G's wicked guitar we make up with the spectacle of a shouty bald man stamping about shouting \"Kill 'im!\" That and the fact that Steve Bes is on fire. Literally. Smoke rising all around him in the most disconcerting fashion. <p/> As we come off stage there is nobody waiting with plastic handcuffs. We count this as a victory. We clear the stage in preparation for Joe and Jonny. The DJ from Inspiration FM teases the audience, telling them that they are about to see Jah Woolley. <p/> People speak kindly to us and tell us that the sound was good. Having seen the Mystics I can get my head around this and I feel pleased. Then the Mystics tell us that we were good, and we tell them that they were good, and respect is all over the place. I realise that we have indeed got away with it. Then I have to have another beer. Quickly. <p/> Joe and Jonny turn in a set that is completely mental. Jon's kick drum is massive, more than compensating for the lack of any bass guitar. Joe is ranting and raving like a good 'un, shredding at his acoustic guitar, but the entire crowd has its back to him, watching as about 50 balloons take off into the lovely blue sky for their evening flight. This is something that I do not envy him. Unable to gaze any longer upon the bizarre spectacle, I join MC Bot backstage for debriefing. \"So, did you know that Curtis was coming?\" he asks. <p/> \"Well, he stopped by my yard about two hours ago in a big red Piper Heidsieck apron and I slipped him Stevie G's backstage pass...but I didn't know he was going to do that.\" \"Aaaaaaah...\" <p/> We hang out behind the stage and listen to Joe and Jon ripping it up like they are The Who or something. They do a version of \"Who Do You Love?\" which goes mad at the end. Jon is doing ridiculous, over-the-top, out-of-time Keith Moon drum rolls. The guitar sounds very peculiar indeed. Then all we can hear is Jon whacking the occasional cymbal, apparently at random. Then we see Jon and Joe come reeling down the ramp from the stage, arm in arm, covered in sweat, gathering momentum and ready to go over in about...ooooh...two and three quarter seconds. Yup. There they go. Whump! Upright again, Jon dives into Ruby and emerges with a bottle of champagne. He and Joe make like racing drivers. At one point they have both got champagne coming out of their noses. By this time, of course, Wilson have hold of the bottle. <p/> Of course, it turns out that we've missed it all. Kathie, who was out front, tells me all about it, how Joe smashed his guitar to matchwood in front of the whole crowd. Those weird single cymbal crashes? That was Jon synchronising with the final, lethal blows. Kathie is concerned \"What's he going to do now?\" she wants to know, not unreasonably. Turns out that Joe had bought a guitar especially for the purpose. \"What did you pay for that then?\" I ask him. \"Ten quid\" he replies, the devious hound. Of course, round about now I have to have another beer. Quickly. <p/> We stick around a while to enjoy Visionstate, who do good things with the old bass-drums-two guitar line-up. Sharp and a bit modal, reminiscent of very early Oasis, but in a good way. They could make a lot of young people very sweaty. I'd enjoyed their record on the Weekender show, and I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps they'd like to play the Labour Club some time? But it's time to go now, for we have to eat and make our way down the hill to Mister Cotton's house for the mother of all parties. <p/> Just to confirm: Nobody got arrested. Nobody got hurt. Nothing got broken. Except Joe's guitar. And he meant to do that. Honest."},{"gigtext_id":527,"datetime":"2005-08-27","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"The way that Joe Woolley sold this night to me was that there was nothing booked in at the Labour Club, so he was planning to take his estimable acoustic club downstairs into the main bar, a sort of \"Beat Saturday\" if you will. You know the sort of thing - not a \"proper\" gig, just a few mates sat round playing tunes in the neighbourhood bar of a Saturday night. Old school. Easy. Local. <p/> So would I care to put in half an hour as a solo acoustic pensioner? Sure, beats watching facile Saturday night TV. I can tape Match of the Day. No problem. <p/> Then a few days before the gig, Joe comes to me and asks about my bass playing. After his recent excesses with Jon Mattock, Joe is after rocking himself up. We spend a boozy evening learning a Warren Zevon tune. Towards the end of the evening Joe tells me that he wants to play the Perfect Disaster's B-52! It crosses my mind that Jonny used to play B-52 with the Perfect Disaster. Bloody hell, you might say. <p/> Disconcerted, enraged with a vital surge of pure rock fury, but without any time to go on a programming spree, I decide that my approach to my set should be of the old school. I style it \"sit down mental\". No amp, no fancy playing or singing, just heads-down, wig-out acoustic idiot music...and if anybody doesn't like it, they can meet my piggie Sam. My only intention is to keep the guitar in tune. After that, it's all up for grabs. <p/> So this is what I play: <p/> Quality People - The Ugliest Song In The World - Big Jake (by Curtis) - Ghosts - Hysteria - Sister Death. <p/> For the last song I am joined by Joe, who burns vital gases out of the atmosphere with his electric guitar. It's about 9:45 and the Labour Club is wringing with hideous scrabbling guitar noise. Yes. Welcome to acoustic night. <p/> Joe takes the stage and plays a few numbers on his own. Then Jon Mattock joins him for a few tunes. The small crowd is growing larger and rowdier. Joe is giving his all. Jonny is watching him like a hawk and drumming like a medium. Then they call me back up and I have to strap on the big bass. We play: <p/> Carmelita (by Warren Zevon) - B52 (by the Perfect Disaster) - Magic Bus (by The Who) <p/> During B52 I look up and see Kevin Haskins walking into the Labour Club. He's over in town for the weekend and apparently someone has told him that I was playing an acoustic set. Well, them's the breaks. Acoustic night just turned into mental, churning acid rock frenzy night. <p/> An encore was attempted but Joe had seized the bass and I couldn't get any noise out of the guitar (I expect he broke it), so I fled the stage, leaving Joe and Jon to pass a contented ten minutes or so re-inventing progressive rock somewhere along the Can/Pink Floyd axis of evil. Off to the Charles Bradlaugh to catch up with Kevin on this most unlikely of Saturday nights at the Labour."},{"gigtext_id":528,"datetime":"2005-08-28","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Well, now really is the time of a great big mother of a battle in the time of the end time.

He is a super-talented British songwriter. For several years Tim and his band Departure Lounge were based in Nashville, Tennessee. There they made a brace of albums which garnered all manner of critical acclaim. Their 1999 waxing \"Out Of Here\" is a classic late night record, required listening for those who value the Velvet Underground's third album, Leonard Cohen or the tender (dark) side of the Perfect Disaster. More recently Tim lived and recorded in Paris, where he worked with ace French producer Kid Loco. He has also toured and recorded with Robin Hitchcock (he can be seen in Jonathan Demme's \"Storefront Hitchcock\" movie) and played guitar with the Blue Aeroplanes.

The music is deceptively simple and inviting, but cast about with mysterious and faintly intimidating ambient shadows, perhaps along the lines of one of John Cale's early solo albums.

And we believe that we have secured for your edification and delight one of the finest, most authentic rock and roll songwriters that the UK has produced in the last twenty years, plus a top supporting cast of talent from NN1 and around. So... <p/> Masters of Budvar present <p/> at <p/> The Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1 <p/> on <p/> Friday 4th November 2005 <p/> DAVE KUSWORTH <p/> There are a few precious people who are truly, irrevocably rock and roll to the bone. <p/> Birmingham's prodigal son Dave Kusworth is one of them. He is also the kind of songwriter who can play his songs all on his own with just an acoustic guitar and his unearthly voice and hold you spellbound, no less rock and roll than if he were fronting a full-on electric band with a ten-piece horn section. The boy just can't help it. <p/> Dave Kusworth has been playing professionally since 1977, and at the turn of the eighties he founded The Hawks with the great Micky Greaney and a teenaged Steven Duffy (last sighted writing the songs on Robbie Williams' new album, for goodness' sake!) He toured and recorded with UK rock legends the Dogs D'Amour before hooking up with the Swell Maps' Nikki Sudden to record several albums for Glass Records, Creation Records and Glitterhouse Records under the name of The Jacobites. He has toured all over the world and his wild, cracked, heartbreaking songs have been covered by The Lemonheads and Mercury Rev. <p/> As I write this, Dave has just returned from touring Germany with his band (where he was joined onstage in Berlin by Sudden) and he has just completed his umpteenth album, the particularly magnificent \"Silver Blades\". He will be appearing solo and acoustic at Masters of Budvar, offering a rare and unmissable insight into his astonishing knack for writing simple but devastatingly effective rock and roll songs. As a writer and as a frontline rock and roll road warrior, Dave really is in the same league as Peter Perrett or Keith Richards. We are honoured to host him and we hope that, come closing time, you will love him, yea, even as we love him. <p/> <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.davekusworth.com\" target=\"new\">www.davekusworth.com</a> </span><!-- artist_website --> <p/> PAUL COX & JOE WOOLLEY <p/> Masters of Budvar regulars will be familiar with the elegant balladeering style of Northampton artist Paul Cox.

A year ago Ray gave one of the most memorable shows that Masters of Budvar have hosted in four years. With a new album ready for release, they are unmissable. <p/> New RAY single Great Strange Dream out now. This new single follows the release of their last two albums - Daylight in the Darkroom (Aug 2006) and Deep Blue Happy (Nov 2005). It was produced by regular band cohort John Rivers, - whose credits include The Specials (Ghost Town), Felt & Ocean Colour Scene. John was also at the production helm for their previous LPs. These LPs (along with their 2001 Rough Trade debut First Light) have seen the London-based band reinforce their reputation for epic, emotive British guitar pop - having been hailed in some quarters as the missing link between House of Love, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Chameleons and Tindersticks <p/> The line up of songwriting brothers Nev and Mark Bradford (vocals and guitar respectively) and drummer Chris Lowe, have now been joined by Martin Tisdall on bass after the departure of Jenni Tarma to LA <p/> Young Masters Mojo <p/> Almost flawless - Ray's touch is breathtaking Q <p/> Guitar notes hang in the air. Words are weighted then dispersed in the ether... but acutely present undercurrents of hostility, give the songs a serrated edge NME <p/> Loveliness galore for those lugubrious nights of the soul.

This time around, I brought a decent camera, my Canon G9, and was able to capture some photos and video, now on YouTube. It was an all-acoustic gig --just Pat, his guitar and a couple of effects pedals. Still, you got to see a glimpse of the man's range as a musician and songwriter, moving gracefully from humor to heartbreak and back again. As good as this gig was, it left me wanting for more. But for now, I'll just have to make due with some of the Jazz Butcher CD's from Amazon. <p/> One nice change since the last gig in April is that London's bars and restaurants now have a smoking ban in effect. So instead of me having to go outside every 20 minutes for fresh air, it was the smokers who went out! Also, it was nice to see the Reading branch of the Pat Fish fan club out in full force.

By April Peter, with his teenage brother Jamie on Guitar (both sons of the ex Only Ones singer Peter Perrett) were invited to a recording session in Bethnal Green where they began work on the original recording of the Killamangiro single, which also included Seb Roachford (Acoustic Ladyland, Polar Bear) on drums. <br/> Within a week Doherty had moved into the Perrett household and they started touring around the country as Babyshambles. By June, Doherty had ended up in Thailand via The Priory and they saw less of him in person and more of him in headlines. For their 1st experience as professional musicians they were left some what disillusioned. <br/> <br/> At the beginning of 2005 with a renewed thirst for playing music again, Peter and Jamie began looking for musicians to form a band. Recruiting their friend Eliot Vernon whom they met the previous year on a sound engineering D.S.S course, they played gigs like the Barfly, ULU, Rhythm Factory & Nambucca, ranging from a 4-6 piece under the working name The Cuts. Their then drummer James Kirkbright eventually had to leave due to medical reasons and the strains of commuting between Leeds and London. <br/> <br/> Whilst discussing the need for a replacement in their local hostelry in Kensington they were overheard by an eccentric Polish drummer, who introduced himself as their future! After an impromptu audition of table tapping and beer bottle bashing they were left convinced that the line-up was complete as the eventual 4 piece. <br/> <br/> With Oskar Starski now in place and only in the band for a week, they were asked to appear at the Glastonbury Festival 2005 (in the medical tent!) where they were rewarded with free passes for the festival. At this time they did their 1st home recordings which included Psychobaby, Watery Eyes and Ten Watt Town. <br/> <br/> They continued playing gigs along the way supporting Babyshambles, The Paddingtons, Cazals, The Maccabees, Selfish Cunt ... <br/> <br/> Never satisfied with their band name, in January 2006 Jamie was inspired to come up with the name Love Minus Zero, not as a homage to Bob Dylan but more of a statement of intent. They set up a Myspace site and continued to gig under the new nom de guerre. <br/> <br/> Spring saw a flurry of gigs and a growing fan base, with a gig in Glastonbury in May being described by Jamie as \"The best reaction I've ever witnessed at a gig, even when I was in Babyshambles. An amazing show!\" <br/> <br/> Their 1st home recorded single \"Psychobaby\" was released last September on their own label and distributed through Cadiz/Pinnacle. <br/> <br/> Reviews of Love Minus Zero:<br/> <br/> \"A caustic riff-laden psychedelic maelstrom, the three track 'Psychobaby' single is the calling card of intent of Love Minus Zero. Immediate yet timeless, Love Minus Zero overthrow outmoded rock cliches with a gratifying urgency, splicing punk malice, psychedelic ska and searing guitars, as the 'Psychobaby' single attests.\" - Nina Antonia (Author and Music Journalist for Uncut and Mojo) <br/> <br/> \"I was seriously impressed by this group, so much so that I went to see them again the following night when they played my local! When I later discovered that Jamie and Peter are in fact the sons of the Only Ones singer/guitarist Peter Perrett, this was understandable, although there is plenty more going on in their sound to ensure that they are not living in the shadow of their father\" - John Higgins, BBC Somerset <br/> <br/> \"Love Minus Zero.

Decades later, after several chance meetings in the UK, Barbeau approached each of them separately. \"The idea of the band really took shape in Berlin in May 2010 when Morris and I met to record, \" says Barbeau, \"but I'd asked them each at different times, and both seemed keen.\" <p/> Barbeau began writing songs specifically for TMT in June 2010, soon after the group's debut gig at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford. The final product, much of it recorded at Kimberley Rew's Remote Farm studio in Cambridgeshire, sounds slightly more pared down compared to Barbeau's recent work, partly due to Metcalfe's influence as co-producer. <p/> \"I've had many bands, but this the most a part of something I've ever felt,\" says Barbeau. \"The fact that it's with Andy and Morris is amazing for me.

It hadn’t always been like this, this name, this life, always having to be running from he knew not what. He straightened, and headed off into the twisting maze of city streets. The fire and noise in his head made finding his way difficult, and for a while he wandered unsteadily through the city, eerily deserted at that early hour. ‘You’d better get going’ a voice suddenly whispered softly behind his left ear. Georges stiffened, and, whirling round, saw nothing but the steam gently rising from a street vent. He set off at a sprint, making his way to the river winding its sinuous route through the city’s heart. This time he had guessed right, the tide was still out and, clambering down the steps to the bank he found his car still parked where he had left it. Igniting, tyres screeched as the old Ford spluttered into motion. Georges was soon at the city limits, the car careered out onto the main road out of town and he headed east into the slowly rising sun. Later, driving fast out on the freeway, the wind whistling on the shield, he took the rise and, looking down over the vast expanse now spread before him he remembered the song that had stayed with him through everything else. The music remained, a piano and saxophone was all he needed. The haze had now lifted, he now knew what he had to do… <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.georgeskaplanpresents.com\" target=\"new\">Georges Kaplan Presents</a> </span><!-- artist_website --> <p/> plus…… <p/> JB NEWMAN & THE BLACK LETTER BAND JB Newman & The Black Letter Band bring you a shot of single malt rock ‘n roll with a shade of Noir style and a poetic twist. <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jbnewmanmusic\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a> </span><!-- artist_website --> <p/> + Pat Fish ( The Jazz Butcher ) <span class=\"artist_website\"> <b>Artist Website</b>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/6182296219\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a> </span><!-- artist_website -->"},{"gigtext_id":728,"datetime":"2013-10-11 20:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Yeah, <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a>'s launching his EP record with his band.

The road that started at the Black Lion on St Giles Street, NN1 some thirty-odd years ago, the road that led some dozen times around the globe, ends here; perhaps only forty miles from where it began. I stand on the corner of a little dogleg street just off Leicester’s Humberstone Road, smoking my hashish in the fog and the drizzle as the law demands. A solitary car comes sailing through the mist. Perhaps it is headed for the club where I’m playing? There is, after all, nothing else down here except for an empty municipal car park and me. As it reaches the corner, the car slows. I wonder if perhaps it is the chap who e-mailed me to say that he hoped to sneak out of his works knees-up in time to catch my set. It is not. The car is full of young Asian lads. They are laughing as they take the corner and speed away into the dirty night. <p/> It’s almost Christmas. In function rooms across the nation bosses are leering at their employees’ wives. Identikit shopping centres across the land are open late to squeeze the last few drops of disposable from the desperate. This Christmas it’s gonna be different. This Christmas it’s gonna be OK. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. <p/> I have flu; proper chest-full-of- immovable-green-filth flu. I have had flu for the past three gigs and I have it now. For my dinner tonight I have enjoyed a bag of Mini-Cheddars and some Guinness flavoured potato crisps. I have a pint of Amstel, the remains of my spliff, three cigarettes and one pound seventy pence in change. Inside the club Kevin Hewick, barefoot and resplendent in his immaculate Nehru suit, is delivering a series of songs of astonishing intensity to an audience of about ten people. <i> <p/> Time’s running out. The money’s running out. <br/> You had a good time, now the money’s running out. </i> <p/> This is where it has all been leading. Let’s hit it. </i> <p/> The Musician in Leicester is a lovely venue. A proper, open-every-night live music venue that hosts acts from the West Coast of America as easily as it hosts local talent. Managed by the charming Chris with the indomitable Malcolm at the controls, it is clean, professional and altogether lovely. Chairs and tables, complete with candles. Excellent, professional PA system. Nice dressing room. Soap in the bathrooms. It’s a class joint. <p/> To be honest, the only reason they are entertaining me and my pals the Venus Fly Trap is because Leicester legend Kevin Hewick has asked them to, but such is the pleasant vibe about the place that this is clearly good enough for Malcolm and everybody else and they treat us very kindly indeed. Malcolm later tells me that, back in his Leicester days, Liam Dullaghan of “New Barcelona” fame was a regular, yea even unto the point of spending the occasional night sleeping on the stage. <p/> Beautiful, purpose-built music club though it be, nobody could mistake the Musician for a place that benefits from a bustling central location. As Alex from the Fly Trap put it, it’s a “destination venue”. You’re not getting any casual walk-up here. This particular Thursday, two grim weeks before Christmas, people have not chosen to make the Musician their destination. <p/> None of this bothers Kevin. Airily pointing out to the few brave listeners that “I haven’t been here for...oooooh...two or three days”, he sets off into an astonishing set of tunes. At one point, as this huge, imposing presence intones a dark and rumbling “Yeeeeeeeeah!” a phrase forms spontaneous and uninvited in my mind: “Folk Clubs of the Cretaceous.” It does not feel like taking the piss. In fact, it feels entirely correct and slightly awesome. <p/> He might be on home turf. He might be going on first on a slow Thursday night in his local hang-out. It doesn’t matter. Kevin gives it everything, burns like Alan Vega and ends up, a fifty-something man with an acoustic guitar, sounding a lot like Nirvana at the top of their game. Follow that! <p/> Tonight I have come with my electric Gretsch and my home-cooked beats. After witnessing Micky Greaney’s astonishing solo acoustic performance on Friday night in Birmingham, I cannot bring myself even to attempt anything in the singer-songwriter line tonight. It’s all been done, better than I could have ever imagined. You should try to hear Micky’s new song “Playlist”, you really should. <p/> There was a moment back at the Oxford gig where, at the bilious conclusion of “Shirley Maclaine”, the poor, overloaded speakers started to vibrate in a rhythm quite different to that which I was generating with my right hand. It sounded like some absurd “acoustic” version of Suicide. Tonight I have a version of their song “Che” on my set list. I have the use of Andy Denton’s Marshall combo and (thanks to the generosity of Tim Harries) a bunch of analogue pedals that go one, two, three louder. Tonight I want to give it some; go down in flames and shit. Yeah. <p/> It doesn’t really happen that way. With some mumbled remarks about the Heat Death of the Universe, I set the little MP3 player off and we’re into a fairly competent but hardly inspiring “Shame About You”. The perverse disco beat of “Che” starts up and I get to mess with the Bigsby a little bit but, with the best will in the world, it all comes out a bit Dave Gilmour down the pub of a Sunday lunchtime. <p/> It’s dark up here. I can’t see the audience. For reasons which seem opaque even at only a few days’ distance I choose to continue with “Wildlife”, a six minute, three chord dirge about dead people. Conceived in the aftermath of seeing John Cale perform “Paris 1919” with an orchestra, it aspires to a certain detatched stateliness; though, to be fair, it would also be possible to see it as a giant waste of everybody’s time. It goes all right, though and now I’m firing up for the Turkish remix of Buffalo Sniper. This gives me the opportunity to explore how Andy’s Marshall responds to demands for feedback and I am delighted to discover that it responds very nicely indeed. Well, I say “nicely”... <p/> As the feedback dies away, the familiar, shuffling beat of “Shakey” starts to run and I manage a half-decent version of that particular six minute, three chord dirge as well. Next, I’m expecting the intro to Southern Mark Smith (complete with sampled Max Eider). Instead I listen, appalled, as the sound of a wheezing Casio issues from the PA. It is the sound of Mister Blagdon! <p/> Mister Blagdon, so local legend has it, was murdered and “walled-up” about a hundred and fifty years ago in the house where I used to live. One day in the nineteen-nineties he manifested via the medium of the Casio keyboard in my living room and committed to tape four small and diseased musical offerings, one of which, his...uh...<i>personal take on</i> Beethoven’s “death march” , is currently dripping like sonic mucus from the PA system. I turn to the MP3 player to discover that I have somehow programmed this into my set list. I have, in fact, somehow confused it with a ten second silence. <p/> Mister Blagdon duly evicted, I perform a fairly undistinguished version of “Southern Mark Smith”. And there it is. We are on the very precipice: just one more song to go. It is, as The King liked to say, now or never. The voice of William Burroughs croaks ominously over a fat, syrupy synthesiser pad, the Indian wedding tabla loops fall into place and here we go into “Solar Core”. If I have anything left to offer, here comes my last chance. It goes all right, as it happens, sparky and vicious, with plenty of that there feedback. For the first time I actually start to make the kind of noise I had been wanting to make all night. Let’s face it, I should really have started here. <p/> I’ve not gone down in flames but I’ve not disgraced myself either. As I’m packing away my kit, Malcolm the sound man tells me that I have “some good material”. <p/> In due course the Fly Trap take to the stage. I don’t think I’ve ever seen them quite this good before. Very tough, very crunchy; and I can’t help but notice that Andy has eagerly taken up the Feedback Challenge. <p/> The evening winds down very pleasantly. A kind man buys me a pint. We make an uneventful journey back to NN1, where I am deposited upon my doorstep. <p/> My engagement book is completely empty. So is my bank account. I’m 55 years old and I have no more idea of what my immediate future might hold than a teenager who’s just walked out of school for the last time.

That alleged eccentricity is but a form of escapism from the sound currents that marked those years and Pat slipped gracefully. <p/> As restless musician has managed to establish parameters walking over the years, changing his youthful aggression for more sedate countenance, with the use of bass and brass section, drums and brushes in a relaxed tone in his interpretations. <p/> His last concert in our country there was celebrating the 25th anniversary of the radio program I present and direct, The 39 sounds, available in www.juanvitoria.com , why was a performance designed to go with a little audience, but expectant and willing to connect with this new format. Some propositions extracted from his latest album, \"Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers\" and drops of past performance, the combination of trumpet, effects pedals, acoustic guitar and vocal simplicity that characterizes him, Pat brought us a bluesy \"Southen Mark Smith \"radically opposed to the original nerve of the subject, although it showed impeccable songs that were treated almost like thirty years ago, if\" Partytime \".

Alan McGee picked up on the band early on, and their first single, “Think!” (CRE 004) was in the second batch of releases on McGee’s fledgling Creation label in 1984. An amazing blast of fresh air and optimism, it was recorded for the princely sum of £50 at Alaska Studios, Waterloo. Another superb single, ‘Where The Traffic Goes’, and 18 minute mini-LP ‘One Two Three Four Five Six Seven, All Good Preachers Go To Heaven’ followed in quick succession before the end of 1984. All these records had a fetching, moddish art-pop slant and received outstanding reviews, with the Minks being nominated by NME as one of the best new acts in Britain. <p/> Following a European tour, supported by McGee’s new protoges The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Jasmine Minks put out a punkier, Buzzcocks inspired, single, ‘What’s Happening’ in 1985 before embarking on recording their debut full length album, set to be named ‘Everybody’s Got to Grow Up Sometime’. This eventually emerged 18 months later, self-titled and patched together from a variety of different sessions after the original tapes were abandoned. In-between times in 1986, the band released ‘Cold Heart’, a song that McGee had originally cut from ‘Preachers’ but which turned out to be their biggest selling single, single of the week in NME, and it also secured them a John Peel session. At this point Sanderson left the band and it took some time for Shepherd to take up the reins and carve out a new future for the Minks. Jasmine Minks returned in 1988 with a new line-up, helmed by Shepherd (now on lead vocals and also sole songwriter) and their best album ‘Another Age’. This was an altogether more accomplished effort with a reflective mood, including the stand-out track ‘Cut Me Deep’, which also featured on Creation’s ‘Doing It For The Kids’ compilation the following year. Sadly, The Minks new crafted and considered approach was out of touch with the baggy loved-up zeitgeist and they managed just one more album , 1989’s ‘Scratch The Surface’ before they drifted apart in the early 90s. However, Jim Shepherd’s restless muse has led him to reconvene the Jasmine Minks several times since then, and McGee also never forgot his “amazing, unknown gem of a band” either, funding another album ‘Popartglory’ in 2001 on Poptones, the label he started after Creation’s demise. One of the tracks on that record, ‘Daddy Dog’, attracted an unprecedented period of notoriety for the band in Scotland, helped by featuring firebrand socialist politician Tommy Sheridan. It is now 5 years since their last shows, and Jasmine Minks will be returning in 2017 playing their classic album ‘Another Age’ in full at their comeback show at The Continental. <p/> The Jazz Butcher Quartet <p/> “The Jazz Butcher is one of the most brilliant incisive pop writers that Britain has produced since the glory days of Ray Davies and Pete Townsend. Criminally overlooked by a media obsessed with the next big thing instead of what is actually good. A truly great songwriter” Alan McGee, president , Creation Records <p/> The Jazz Butcher is the nom de guerre of Northampton’s Pat Fish, who over the years has masterminded various Groups, Conspiracies, Sikkorskis from Hell and, latterly, a Quartet. <p/> A cult figure right from the start, The Jazz Butcher developed a not altogether serious sozzled Brit pop aristocrat persona, a million years before Brit Pop, with musical nods to Jonathan Richman (‘Roadrunner’ was memorably covered by the Butcher early on), Robyn Hitchcock and Lou Reed. <p/> Pat formed the band in Oxford in 1982 (after he had previously been a member of Wow Federation while at university in the city) with Max Eider, who proved to be the Butcher’s most loyal co-conspirator. Max has now retired, but features on most of The Butcher’s 15 or so albums released since then, beginning in 1983 with ‘Bath of Bacon’, on Glass Records, alongside fantastic debut single ‘Southern Mark Smith’, regarded by absolutely everyone who’s heard it as one of the best songs of the eighties. Further albums on Glass, ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ and ‘Sex and Travel’ featured guest appearances from David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus. <p/> In 1988 The Jazz Butcher instigated a transfer to Creation Records, where he became one of the label’s best loved acts, releasing seven albums for the label starting with ‘Fishcotheque’ in 1988 and ending with ‘Illuminate’ in 1995, with loads of drunken touring in-between, establishing enclaves of Butcher fanatics all over Europe and the States. <p/> Thereafter, Butchery continued, but very much underground, with only occasional peeks over the parapet such as the ‘Glorious and Idiotic’ album on Roir in 2000, until the Butcher’s legion of followers worldwide crowd-funded the ‘Last of the Gentleman Adventurers’ album in 2012. <p/> Renowned archive trawlers Fire Records, have recently started up a Jazz Butcher reissue campaign, beginning in Feb 2016 with the long sold out ‘Adventurers’ album, and Pat is also back with a new band, the Jazz Butcher Quartet. Whilst Pat is often out and about solo in Northampton and the South, full Quartet shows are pretty rare, and he’s also not played in the North for a long time, so don’t miss this opportunity to see the legendary Jazz Butcher and his band at The Continental."},{"gigtext_id":759,"datetime":"2017-04-08 20:00:00","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Preston went really well, with a really warm, responsive audience and a very kind host in Rico la Rocca, who put the show on.

As a solo artist, recent shows include Hamburg, Dortmund, New York City, Tokyo, Brussels and London, as well as his adopted home town of Northampton where he still regularly turns out with his acoustic guitar to support visiting artists. <p/> He likes collaborations, too. Apart from his lengthy association with Northampton-based digital hooligans Wilson over the years 2001-2009, Fish has recorded and appeared on stage with David J, Spacemen 3, Bristol’s The Blue Aeroplanes, German band M Walking On The Water, French indie art rock band Chelsea Paris and acclaimed Los Angeles shoegazers, The Black Watch. <p/> The thing about Pat Fish is that he is not tribal about music. Some people know him from his friendship with Spacemen 3, others for his fondness for Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; some know him because he has worked with members of Bauhaus, others regard him as a “classic” independent songwriter in the vein of Pete Astor or Dan Treacy. Fishy just fetches his acoustic guitar and his notebook and heads for the railway station. <p/> His current inspirations: as always, the Velvet Underground, Alex Chilton, Peter Laughner, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers, John Martyn, Davy Graham and many, many more. <p/> Do you like your melodies sweet and your humour as black as pitch? Would you take a chance on something simple, intimate and direct from an artist who is on record as saying “What I do is not entertainment” but who regularly induces little bursts of outraged laughter from the audience? Do you want to see the real thing? You should maybe go and see Pat Fish. <p/> <b>Plus</b> <p/> SHORT STORIES: Formed in 2007 in Bristol, England by Tim Rippington and Stephen Miles. Tim and Stephen were at school together, a year apart but sharing the same musical values that made them firm friends. After school, the two went their separate ways – Tim spent the next twenty years playing in various indie bands such as the Flatmates, the Five Year Plan and later the Beatnik Filmstars. He also ran his own recording studio for five years, and produced records for, amongst others, the now legendary indie label Sarah Records. In 2003 Tim formed a new band Forest Giants, who made four great LPs before folding in 2007. In the meantime, Steve became a school teacher, dabbling only briefly in music with a spell as drummer for Bristol indie band Modesty Blaise. <p/> In 2007 the two met for the first time in 20 years, and discovered that they still had much in common and The Short Stories were born. Since then several albums and singles have been released which can be heard here, <a href=\"https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"new\">https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/</a>"},{"gigtext_id":757,"datetime":"2017-04-27 19:30:00","type":"selfreview","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"A very pleasant evening, much enhanced by Chef Watson and his most excellent rice, peas and plantain."},{"gigtext_id":760,"datetime":"2017-05-25 19:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Labour Party social event featuring the Labour Party Candidate Kevin McKeever with a live set by the Jazz Butcher Quartet.

From the release of the band’s first album Bath of Bacon on Glass Records in 1983 up to their crowd-funded and self-released most recent album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers from 2012 (reissued by Fire Records in 2016), frontman Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher himself) has led various incarnations of the group through a consistent (if somewhat sporadic in recent times) catalog of music to rival that any band out there. But much of the band’s music has been out of print for years, the victim of labels going out of business or being bought up, and of general bad luck. Fire Records has undertaken a project to right these wrongs, releasing a series of box sets collecting the band’s work. The first of these, The Wasted Years, came out last fall and collects the band’s four Glass Records-era albums. The second, The Violent Years, came out on Friday and collects the band’s first four albums (out of six total) for Creation Records. In honor of these releases, the current line-up held a performance last week at the storied 100 Club in the heart of London. </p><p/> What might have been somewhat surprising, for a show meant to celebrate the reissue of such a storied back catalog, was how much of the night (a full half of the set) concentrated on the latest album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers. After an introductory variant on the “Jazz Butcher Theme” from In Bath of Bacon, Fish and his band went directly to four songs from that record, “Animals,” “Tombé dans les pommes,” the title track, and “Black Raoul.” The record appeared two more times later in the set, with “Shakey” and “Solar Core.” Possibly an indication that Fish is more interested in the present than in dwelling too much in the past, but the songs are still very much classic Jazz Butcher material. Certainly no one in the audience seemed to mind. </p><p/> But Fish and his current band (which has not yet appeared on any recordings) did make several nods back to the “classic” Butcher, with “Living In a Village” from 1988’s Fishcotheque, “Mr. Odd” from 1990’s Cult of the Basement, and “Shirley Maclaine” from 1991’s Condition Blue representing The Violent Years set, and “Party Time” from In Bath of Bacon. The arrangements of the songs were updated to fit with the latest line-up (particularly the impressive trumpet and flugelhorn playing of Simon Taylor, which added a unique tone to the music) but were still instantly recognizable. </p><p/> The biggest surprise of the night for many was the inclusion of a new song, “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar.” The band has been performing the track the track for a couple of years now, but it has yet to appear in recorded form. “You can’t buy this one anywhere. I guess that means it’s time for a new album,” teased Fish, to a roar of approval from the audience. Hopefully with the renewed interest that the box sets are generating, it won’t be too long until that becomes a reality. </p><p/> The band closed out the evening with an encore of “Southern Mark Smith” from 1984’s A scandal in Bohemia. The enthusiasm of the audience even seemed to take Fish and the band by surprise, so they added one more song that wasn’t on the setlist, a cover of The Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner” (which the Jazz Butcher released as a single in 1984). “That’s all the songs we know!” Fish said, promising that the band would be back soon. True to his word, another set at the 100 Club, opening for The Bevis Frond, has already been announced for the end of May. </p><p/> Singer-songwriter Tim Keegan opened the show, performing songs from his most recent album The Long Game, self-released in 2015. A long-time cohort of performers including Robyn Hitchcock and The Blue Aeroplanes, Keegan had made a mark in the early-to-mid 2000s with his band Departure Lounge, but disappeared from the scene for several years. He says that he’s ready to stage a return, with a “proper” release of The Long Game followed by new material coming soon. </p>"},{"gigtext_id":772,"datetime":"2018-05-05 19:30:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"Supporting Luke Haines"},{"gigtext_id":770,"datetime":"2018-05-24 20:00:00","type":"announcement","credit":"Pat Fish","credit_date":null,"body":"CND 60th Anniversary celebration. <p/> Should be a good night.

It is likely my most prized possession and it cost me nothing. They say meeting your idols can be dangerous as they may not live up to your idea of them. More on that later...and sorry (not sorry) for the long post. </p><p/> The Jazz Butcher has been the soundtrack of my life, from 1986 to present. Just like Thomas Peterson, Bloody Nonsense was my first album, though the Canadian version differed a bit from the U.S. I never stopped listening to Pat. I loved and love his music dearly. Like many of you have said, it got me through good times and bad and - I cry as I write this - I owe him a lot. </p><p/> I'm glad I got to convey my gratitude to him over the years (many have used the word fandom in their posts) - Facebook Messenger is great that way for being able to reach out to people, even people you don't really know. And, as my wife Kathleen and I planned a UK trip for April 2019 (remember travel?), I reached out to Pat and said we'd be coming up to Northampton and I'd love to buy him a beer or five to show my appreciation for how much his music has meant to me. </p><p/> Much to my elation, Pat was game. We arrived in Northampton - couldn't get there any quicker, really, as we landed in London and pretty much took a train there immediately. And, after an initial scare where I didn't quite have his right phone number, Pat and I connected on Messenger again and agreed to meet at The Lamplighter for 7 pm. As our cab approached, I saw this tall, harrowing figure walking into the pub and I knew it was him. This was happening - so many feelings were swirling about inside me. </p><p/> We introduced ourselves, grabbed pints and sat. And then - acutely starstruck - I pretty much forgot how to speak for about 45 minutes. Luckily this rarely happens to my wife, so she held the fort during that time. I eventually came out of my shell and...it was just wonderful. </p><p/> (BTW friends had asked me, before our trip, \"what will you ask him?\", and I purposely had no questions prepared. I didn't want this to be an interview and I didn't want it to be all about me. I just wanted to hang out with Pat and get to know him a little bit.) </p><p/> He was so gracious and generous. Beer and conversation flowed freely. He was kind and interested in us. We were then joined by his good friend Rachel McGrath, who got me to express my fandom by asking me, at some point, what my top 5 JBC songs were. I rhymed them off easily, with the top one being, since forever, Big Saturday (as I'm crying again). </p><p/> Imagine how over the moon I was when Pat invited us back to Fishy Mansions for a nightcap. How I held my cool, I've no idea - maybe the drink, or maybe by that time it was clear how genuine Pat was. And, around 1 am, Pat grabbed a guitar, and then my wife - I will forever be indebted to her - asked Pat to \"play Jean's favourite song, Big Saturday\". He obliged, and as I sob now, that's also me sobbing in the video at the beginning. I just lost it. I literally pinched myself, couldn't believe this was actually happening. </p><p/> What a perfect evening getting to know a lovely human being, if only a bit. Meeting my idol exceeded my expectations and by far. </p><p/> It is also incredible to have read your posts and know that this kind of interaction with Pat was commonplace. He made so many people so happy by being so generous. </p><p/> Finally, as all of you, I am heartbroken today. My heart goes out especially to those who knew him much more so than I did, his friends and loved ones. I am so sorry for your loss. It seems Pat was every bit as good to his loved ones that he was to simple fans like me. </p><p/> I treasure the memory of having met Pat and am so grateful to him, and for the fact that we still have his music. JBC forever, folks.
