			We experienced two of the most unexpected technical problems that I have ever
			faced!
			<p>
			1. We came on stage, all neatly soundchecked, only to discover that the pad
			on the CD backing track was a whole semitone out with all the guitars! Now,
			I had just tuned the guitars (4 of 'em!), so I knew it wasn't that. What it
			was was that the house CD player was one of those DJ jobs with varispeed.
			Some prannet had obviously leaned on the varispeed button at some point,
			thrusting Wilson into the Omniverse. A quick appeal from the stage brought
			the house soundman hurtling across the dancefloor to "reset devices" and we
			carried on happily.
			<p>
			2. Having broken a string on my telecaster, I was delighted to see it
			reappear, fully strung-up, on my guitar stand. I picked it up for the start
			of "Secret Government" only to discover that it was in regular EADGBE
			tuning...which was odd, as it was supposed to be in an open D tuning. I had
			to spend the first verse of the sing dragging the tuning back. Thank God for
			silent tuners! Anyway, it all went smoothly enough and we carried on without
			incident. It was only about 3 songs later that I became aware that it wasn't
			my telecaster at all, but a look-alike kindly loaned by the other group!
			Doh!
			<p>
			I tell ya - we thought we were SO well prepared!
			<p>
			Still, for all those little irritations the set went down well.
			The audience was a fairly imposing bunch, about 100 strong, with pretty much
			every pro musician in town, along with various representatives from the
			Spacemen/Spiritualized axis, so it was quite a relief to hear people saying
			nice things about us.
			<p>
			(It was even more fun to overhear bona-fide punters shouting "brilliant" at
			each other at the bar.)
			<p>
			After the show we retired to Shakespeare Villas for a knees-up.
			Imagine our surprise when the entire staff of the club, promoter, manager,
			soundman and even a couple of barmaids showed up toting a crate of beer!
			I think we might be "in there".
			<p>
			We all enjoyed ourselves (in a scary kinda way) and will definitely be doing
			more shows wherever we can.
			I think we're going to play The Packhorse in Leeds on 14th April, and we
			could well be back at the Soundhaus on 19th April, but neither date is rock
			solid yet.
			<p>
			Music? Wot's it like?
			A sort of small and moody ${sumosonic}, but with more emphasis on dub and
			general phatness (phatitude?)
			<p>
			We've started recording a demo with Ian the Sumo vocalist/producer.

			Well, against all the odds Wilson pulled off something of an away win last night.
			Even if it was in our own home town.
			<p>
			After a week of frenzied - if accidental - recruiting, the Wilson line-up emerged onstage last night looking
			something like:
			<p>
			Wilson Headstone - Telecaster, Singer<br>
			Misery Wilson - Bass vibrations<br>
			Agent Wilson - Percussion<br>
			G-Man - Stratocaster<br>
			B-Man - MC<br>
			E-Man - Theremin-like machine that goes Pffffffffttthhhhweeeeeeeoooop.
			<p>
			The set was the usual current one:
			Critters - God's Green Earth - Secret Government - Sweet Home Alabama - Burn, Hollywood, Burn - Dark Agenda.
			<p>
			The Wilson auxiliaries, E-Man (Curtis E. Johnson), B-Man (Ian Botterill, of ${sumosonic} and Fat Controller) and
			G-Man (Steve Gordon of NN1 Tarantino Funk kingpins P-Hex) all distinguished themselves very well indeed.
			Only B-Man fell over. Conceivably he was doing this on purpose, but it rather depends on who you're talking to.
			E-Man, being The Bald One, got to do Eno and G-Man added chunk funk and razzle in a fine demonstration of
			What To Do With A Fender Twin.
			<p>
			We were supposed to be playing around 9:00 pm, but early in the evening it transpired that, in fact, we were to
			headline a four band bill (it was easier on the drum kit situation, and all the other groups, being properly
			youthful, probably found us faintly intimidating anyway). Accordingly, Wilson took the stage about ten minutes
			before our ludicrous UK licensing laws closed the bar and about ten minutes mafter a steaming performance from the
			young and very talented Capdown. Capdown (short for "Capitalist Downfall", I'm told) are a rocking skatepunk n ska
			outfit who got the large and predominantly youthful crowd going something fierce. (You can catch them at this
			year's Reading Festival - Capdown, not the large and predominantly youthful lot.)
			<p>
			Accordingly, we had a bit of a tough act to follow and very little time to get people over.
			And we only went and pulled it off.
			A lot of the younger punters began to mumble disconsolately at the sight of a bunch of grizzled pensioners
			starting up, and some wandered out into the warm night and the beer garden. By half way through the set, though,
			the mumblers were starting to dance and the gardeners began to return.
			<p>
			With B-Man on fine form, having just received a spectacular and well-deserved kicking from one of the town's
			leading songwriters in the front bar, and with a powerful live sound from Geoff Kirk, our shit was truly swinging.
			Hollywood was duly incinerated
			(the sound of 10,000 enraged LA Korean store owners marching on the Mondrian Hotel) before Wilson laid their Dark
			Agenda upon the assembled and hideous guitar noise was the outcome.
			Thence to an old school Sumo party at the Agent's yard and a beastly hangover this morning.
			Nice one.

			<b>
			NEW YEAR'S EVE - JBC GO UP-COUNTRY
			</b>
			<p>
			On the afternoon of 31st December 2001 I learn something that
			I didn't know before. Owen is explaining to Steve about today's
			JBC destination, Norfolk. The natives, he tells us, were only
			converted to Christianity in the 17th Century. To Steve, just
			off the plane from Downtown LA, this may be interesting cultural
			background. To me it is one more in a concatenation of signs
			that maybe this time the JBC have got themselves into something
			just a little bit too deep.
			<p>
			It all started a few weeks back when The Talented One suggested
			that we might care to do a show on New Year's Eve at a smart people's
			country house hotel in deepest Norfolk that had somehow fallen
			into the hands of an old school pal of his. A hefty fee was on
			the cards, with hotel rooms and all our worldly demands fulfilled.
			Unsurprisingly, this struck your correspondent as being one of
			those Good Ideas. 
			<p>
			It also reminded me of a classic remark made by my good friend,
			George, a fifty year old shamanically-inclined Turkish aristocrat
			who has somehow managed to end up living over the fire station
			in Northampton NN1. During one of our habitual fireside conversations
			George had advised me that the citizens of Sheringham in Norfolk
			lived life in the "classic, old-fashioned and normal style."
			It struck me that George would love to spend his New Year's Eve
			in a Norfolk country house hotel.
			<p>
			Assuming, then, that we had lucked out getting booked by a load
			of mad rich rustics for their private New Year celebrations,
			the JBC said.
			<p>
			It was only just before Christmas that it was revealed to us
			that this show was actually open to the public and that we were
			allowed, nay encouraged,  to advertise it. At the same time we
			discovered that tickets were a positively Japanese 
			&pound;45:00 a head and, perhaps unsurprisingly, they had not been selling
			that well. That big fat fee suddenly started to look a touch
			more theoretical. Nonetheless, by this stage we had all made
			our travel arrangements and booked some other UK shows besides,
			so we decided to go ahead with this mental scheme and have as
			many laughs as possible from the whole weird experience. 
			<p>
			In which, the reader will be glad to hear, we were in no wise
			disappointed.
			<p>
			While the majority of the posse travel up from London by train,
			the hardcore rhythm section boys and gals drive with the equipment
			from NN1.
			<p>
			Steve is at the wheel, superb in his handling of the ubiquitous
			"roundabouts"
			that plague the English roads. I navigate and Lynda sits between
			us, trying to get a glimpse of the English countryside as it
			flashes by. Kathie, Owen and George are in the back with the
			kit. Arranged on a big pile of cushions they cope well with life
			as freight until, somewhere east of Newmarket, the sun goes down.
			Then they go very quiet.
			<p>
			About ten miles outside Norwich - perhaps twenty miles from our destination -
			there is a faintly desperate rapping on the wall that divides the freight from the front. 
			<p>
			"Where are we?" cries an audibly anxious Owen.
			<p>
			I reassure him that we are not far from our target, and indeed
			soon we are pulling up in the snow-covered yard of an enormous
			old wooden mill perched over a river in a remote Norfolk backwater,
			which turns out, as fate would have it, to be only three or four
			miles from the place where in another life I recorded 
			"Cult of the Basement"
			and "Condition Blue".
			<p>
			The freight is released gratefully from the back of the Transit
			and we all waddle into the hotel's smart and attractive bar to warm up. 
			<p>
			We are greeted warmly and hospitably by the gentleman who booked
			us, but there is a detectable note of - shall we say - flakiness
			in the air. When the hard-bitten touring engine meets the well-intentioned
			but inexperienced amateur odd little things like securing one's
			room or a mat for the drum kit can become the source of unexpected
			dilemmas, which can lead to confusion, even frustration. Nonetheless,
			with the invaluable help of our support band, Tumbling Dice,
			we get everything sorted and zip through an encouraging soundcheck,
			which we complete just in time for dinner.
			<p>
			Our table is huge and round. Somebody remarks that it's all a bit Arthurian.
			"Yes,"
			says Owen, 
			"And I know who King Arthur is."
			<p>
			He is looking across the table directly at George.
			<p>
			A top dinner ensues. The hotel clearly has a fine chef and we
			dine on all manner of good things, including the quite possibly
			the best chips to be had outside of Belgium. As we finish up,
			the dining room begins to fill with wholesome-looking families
			gathered in their best togs for a festive blow-out. It occurs
			to me that this might be a good time for
			the scary musicians to make themselves scarce, so I leg it up
			to my room and set about devising a list of tunes for tonight's show. 
			<p>
			It soon dawns on me that it would be stupid for me to try and
			assemble a set list without consultation with the rest of the
			band, so I find myself obliged to go looking for them back down
			in the dining room. As I arrive I find Steve, Lynda, Anne and
			Baerbel sitting at a beautifully set table with George and bottle
			of Champagne. It immediately becomes clear that it is George
			who has ordered the Champagne. 
			<p>
			Max and I slip away for a moment and construct a set list, which,
			we imagine fondly, will cause all manner of consternation among
			the rest of the band. We are wrong. They all think it's fine, the mad bastards.
			<p>
			Here it is:<br>
			${odd}<br>
			${drugs}<br>
			${jane}<br>
			${who}<br>
			${comeon}<br>
			${morphine}<br>
			${rain}<br>
			${hour}<br>
			${wheel}<p>
			midnight Champagne, snogging and shouting break<p>
			${friendly}<br>
			${skins}<br>
			${niagara}<br>
			${sis}<br>
			${gf}<br>
			${party}<br>
			${zombie}
			<p>
			Now, the sensitive reader will have noticed that we are talking
			about a New Year's Eve gig here, and it is fair to say that there was some considerable
			debate about whether the band should include the Twin Towers
			Of Misery And Despair (${morphine} and ${sis}) in the set tonight.
			<p>
			This debate ended up with everyone in the band saying 
			"Naaah".. fuck..
			<p>
			At about 10:00pm Tumbling Dice take the stage. A duo with backing
			tracks of their own devising, they play a brilliant party set
			of covers from the songbooks of The Beatles and The Stones, with
			tunes by The Kinks and The Small Faces thrown in for good measure.
			They even do a Status Quo number! During this last I catch Claire
			out doing That Seventies Dance: you know, the one with the hands
			on the hips and the weird rhythmic spastic twitching at the waist.
			<p>
			"I bet they still dance like that round here,"
			I tell her.
			Then I turn around and see a local couple about ten feet away - doing exactly that!
			<p>
			While the dice are tumbling I also note that George, who generally
			never drinks, is well on his way. He is shaking his head to the
			sixties sounds like there is no tomorrow. I have never seen George
			rock so hard.
			<p>
			Our set list is planned to break for the midnight shenanigans.
			We refuse to learn "Auld Lang Syne"
			and we don't want to ruin people's New Year party, so we have resolved to stop awhile for kissing
			and shouting at the auspicious hour. This entails our starting
			at exactly 11:10pm. We finally make it onstage to start at 11:18pm,
			but no matter 
			we have found a clock that can be seen from the stage, so we
			fondly imagine that we are in control.
			<p>
			As we take the stage I essay a short speech to explain to the
			few natives gathered what exactly the fuck is liable to be going
			on. As you probably know, the JBC only generally play in places
			where people want to see them. (It makes life so much more pleasant
			for band and punters alike, we feel.)
			<p>
			This is clearly not the case tonight, so I give a little spiel
			about how..  well, you know how all the bands say they're different..
			well, we really are different because different.
			<p>
			Yeah, nice one, Pat.
			<p>
			From the first number it's clear that the improvised sound system and the under-rehearsed
			JBC are both working as well as they possibly could. Within a
			couple of tunes dancing has broken out. A couple of tunes later
			I look up to see George leaping two-footed into the air. A few
			songs down the road and Owen's floor tom-tom collapses on top of his pint, shattering the
			glass and scattering beer everywhere. He mends the drum, sorts
			out a new pint and puts it back down. A few minutes later the
			drum collapses again, with more shattered glass and squandered
			beer. But we are having fun.
			<p>
			We arrive at the first Tower Of Misery And Despair.
			<p>
			Diamorphine goes off like a big mental bomb.
			<p>
			We cruise through some pop songs and a particularly sociopathic
			Wheeler and make it to the midnight break without problems.
			<p>
			Champagne is opened. Hugs and kisses all round. Everybody has
			made it into 2002. 
			<p>
			We pick up again some ten minutes down the road with a nicely
			paced Spacemen
			and reel on through the rest of our show. People, God bless
			them, are going mental. Not even Sister Death can stop them.
			(My excuse goes along the lines of: 
			"Well, you can't have a dance without a waltz, boys and girls, now can you?"
			To my astonishment, I get away with it.)
			<p>
			We finish with a typically vile rendition of 
			Zombie Love, then encore with Roadrunner.
			By the end of it I am barking like a big stupid dog.
			<p>
			Everyone is astoundingly kind about our show. While Tumbling
			Dice return to play a couple more top party tunes we chill the
			fuck out with bottles of Champagne and the rest. A top soul DJ
			takes over and the party goes on until about 4:00am, by which
			time, thoroughly mashed, Kathie, George and I retire to our room
			with one final bottle of Champagne and a bunch of Rizlas.
			<p>
			We awake the following day to beautiful winter sun on the river
			beneath our window. Somehow, for God is great, we have survived
			JBC Vietnam.
