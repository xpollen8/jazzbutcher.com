# Hello!

David Whittemore, here..

Like many of you, being in Pat's sphere of influence has colored my life to a certain extent.  I would not *here* had I not learned about programming for the web way back (1994!).  The initial Jazz Butcher website was one of the first 1,000 _in the world_.

Once something like that starts, it just keeps on keeping on.

# *Which is where _you_ come in*

None of us will last forever, but with a little bit of effort, perhaps the collected Jazz Butcher archives, as stored on jazzbutcher.com, can have a fighting chance to make it past just my lifetime.

This is the initial effort to formalize a public/participatory framework for maintaining the jazzbutcher.com website.

With shared ownership in this repository, the raw information that drives jbc com will not be stuck "somewhere".

This is the first step: announcing the intent, and inviting participants in an open sharing of information.

# *I hope you'll join us*
