			<ul>
			<li><b>15.2</b>{' '}
				JBC gets on the bus at 5am {pete} is roaring drunk.  {tony} considers bashing him.  Drive and float to Paris.
				French tour promoter is young and practically monolingual.
				Tony considers belting him.  JBC play four live songs
				and executes
				<Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb15.html">lengthy interview
				all live on Bernard Lenoir, national radio</Link>.
				Dooj falls asleep.  JBC buy beers and
				rehearse in a garage until two or three in the morning,
				with friends who skin up.  Tony considers marrying them.
				A long day.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb16.html"><b>16.2</b>
				Paris - <b>Theatre L&apos;European</b></Link>
				Seated; 300 people, some drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb17.html"><b>17.2</b>
				Bordeaux - <b>Le Jimmy</b></Link> 650km.  drive to Bordeaux.
				Wake up at the back, you&apos;re on tour.  {joe} gets
				in massive ruck with everyone in the restaurant at dinner.
				Tony considers judging him.  <b>Le Jimmy</b> (yes!)
				is a punky club with about 200 souls.  We rock.  Many
				drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb18.html"><b>18.2</b>
				Nates - <b>Floride</b></Link> Tiny club, fragile heads.
				Lead singer buys cakes for all.  What a swell guy.  Pete
				makes the first of many doomed sexual overtures, later
				asks promoter for girl&apos;s address.  Pat, Kathie, Joe
				and Dooj stay at the Holiday Inn.  Tony, Nick and Pete
				stay in small concentration camp above the club, which
				was severely overloaded at 150 people.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb19.html"><b>19.2</b>
				Rennes - <b>Ubu</b></Link> Short drive today, which is
				fortunate as Tony succeeds in running out of petrol
				today.  Tony considers bashing everybody.  T.V. Smith
				of the Adverts opens, solo and acoustic.  He is great.
				Some 150 customers, the show a little dull, but a great
				party afterwards.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb20.html"><b>20.2</b>
				Lorient - <b>Le Manege Enchante</b></Link> (that&apos;s the
				&quot;Magic Roundabout&quot;, you Brits).  Beer for breakfast.
				Beer for lunch.  This is more like it.  Joe fails to
				get delays moving at soundcheck.  Pat considers having
				him sent to Siberia.  Pretentious Mexican dinner.  Everyone
				considers dropping everybody else.  Dooj terrorised
				in dressing room by enormous dog called &quot;The Head&quot;.
				Pat and Tony shamelessly collaborate with the beast,
				which Joe insists is a bear.  Staggeringly pretentious
				support group.  JBC deliver first really hot show of
				the tour. Only partially morose.  250 in the house.
				Some drunks, chief among them Tony and Pat.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb21.html"><b>21.2</b>
				Morlaix - <b>Le Coatelan</b></Link> Onstage at 8:00 pm
				on a sunday in an ART SHED near a village in French
				Wales.  50 punters.  Brilliant. Dinner of the tour follows.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><b>22.2</b>	Drive back to Paris.  See Pascal.  Get paid.  </li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li className="flex flex wrap">
			<div className="w-1/2">
			<b>23.2</b>	Drive out of France very fast, as well
				have all had enough.  Got to Breda in Holland.  Tony
				wants us all to feel the same.  It&apos;s carnival night
				in Breda.
				Photo, taken by Kathie, who was smart enough to figure this out, attached.

			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb24.html"><b>24.2</b>
				Breda - <b>Zanetti</b></Link> Nick has a snare drum and
				some brushes.  The other three have guitars.  Everyone
				sings as we play in a small stone bar with psychadelic
				lights for about 25 people.  We&apos;re supposed to be in
				Rotterdam, but someone fucked up.  This is great fun
				anyway.  We play <i>King Of Joy</i> and <i>Bad Moon
				Rising</i>, but Kathie prevents us from rendering the
				classic Red River Dave song the California Hippy Murders.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb25.html"><b>25.2</b>
				Amsterdam - <b>Kremlin</b></Link> A hipster hangout in
				a scary and squalid part of town.  Small and full (100?150?)
				and quite cheerful.  French drunks.  Drive back to Breda
				cursing the gas stations that only work on credit cards.
				Tony gets breath tested by The Man and comes up negative.
				We all applaud as we drive away from the bewildered cops.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb26_2000.html"><b>26.2</b>
				Breda - <b>Para</b></Link> and <Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb26_2300.html">
				Breda - <b>Zanetti</b></Link> A double header.  We were
				booked for Para (100 people.  Loud and vicious) but
				we went on to <b>Zanetti</b> again to play in the basement,
				a fabulous drugs cavern where we played not-really-acoustic
				at-all for extra money and laffs.  Many drunks.  Deep joy.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb27.html"><b>27.2</b>
				Hamburg - <b>Logo</b></Link> The first of four German dates
				supporting {belly}.
				Nobody in Hamburg seems to know who they are.  350 people
				in a smallish club.  We and they are great.  Quite forget
				about Old Belly, who come on later and are not very
				interested in a typically {_4AD} way.
				Many drunks.  Some narcotics abuse.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Feb28.html"><b>28.2</b>
				Berlin - <b>Loft</b></Link> Great journey to Berlin, wherein
				Tony Pat and Kathie form <b>The New Government Of Russia</b>
				(policies on application - $5,799.99).  Shoddy show
				from the JBC but {belly} are more interesting tonight.  We like Gail
				the bass player.  If anyone&apos;s worried about the two
				singers they&apos;re being very adult about it.  400 people
				in the house.  East German drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar1.html"><b>1.3</b>
				Munich - <b>Charterhalle</b></Link> Bus refuses to start.
				Pete and Pat abandon rest of party in Berlin, get in
				German tour manager&apos;s car and play Munich <b>Charterhalle</b>
				as a duo.  The &quot;club&quot; is the hall of Munich&apos;s only-just-disused
				airport.  Intimate it isn&apos;t especially with only 200
				people in this huge barn.  We all have fun, though,
				and loot {belly}&apos;s booze n stuff ruthlessly.
				Meanwhile, in Berlin, Joe fails to find the way to Cologne
				for four hours.  Everyone, I&apos;m told, considers stabbing him.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar2.html"><b>2.3</b>
				Cologne - <b>Luxor</b></Link> We arrive to find that {belly}&apos;s
				van has broken down.  We laugh and <Link
				href="/press/94takeover.html"> send Tony in The Love
				Bus to rescue them</Link>.  400 people, a really good show.
				Many drunks, some violent.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><b>3.3</b>
				We drive to Freiburg.  On the way, entirely by chance,
				we pull in at what must be the only vegetarian motorway
				restaurant in Europe.  Deep joy, snow, vodka, Freiburg,
				pizza, bliss.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar4.html"><b>4.3</b>
				Valenza Po - <b>Circolo Palomar</b></Link> Long scary drive
				over the Alps to Italy.  50 people watch us play for
				over two hours at a wonderful club.  The chap on stage
				doing the handstands and shit is the promoter.  The
				hotel has llamas.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar5.html"><b>5.3</b>
				Florence - <b>Auditorium Flog</b></Link> (No, honest!).
				800 in a huge discotheque and a rider that would embarrass
				the support group at the Rock Garden.  No wonder the
				singer punched out the toilet doors in the dressing
				room.  This offers the cue for the release of general
				mayhem, not helped by the Hotel Putana where we have
				been put.  Great concert, insulting promoters, bloody night.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar6.html"><b>6.3</b>
				Forli - <b>Ex Macchina</b></Link> Small, communist-run
				club, the opposite of last night, and all the more pleasing.
				150 people, many drunks, and a support group something
				like {haus}.  More drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar7.html"><b>7.3</b>
				Salzburg - <b>Nonntal</b></Link> Pete, acting on an internal
				agenda that has led him to drink solidly for 72 hours,
				disappears in the middle of the night to devote his
				time to serving drinks on British Airways.  &quot;A little
				twist with that?&quot; JBC are expected in Salzburg, so we
				drive.  It also appears that the Love Bus is ready to
				expire at any moment, so will fill the tank with the
				engine running.  Somewhere on the way I am seized of
				a powerful idea and make a phone call.  Salzburg -
				<b>Nonntal</b>.  We arrive after hours of anxious bus
				stuff and full scale Alpine blizzard.  There isn&apos;t much
				time for a soundcheck.  I just turn up the Telecaster
				and hope for the best.  200 people, a nervy beginning.
				It ended up well.  &quot;You don&apos;t need another guitarist&quot;
				says the promoter.  Smiling, I make another phone call.
				Promoter buys us all an elaborate dinner.  Tony considers
				sloshing him.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><b>8.3</b>
				We have a day off in Salzburg, which is all it takes.
				I stay in bed till five, have a meal in the Styrian
				bar, pick up our secret weapon and go back to the Styrian
				bar, where I meet the group and introduce them to {lix}.
				Jagermeister.  Drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar9.html"><b>9.3</b>
				Lienz - <b>Glocklturm</b></Link> This is where it gets
				Really Weird.  The Love Bus finally clocks out at lunchtime,
				and we travel the last 80km to the show on the back
				of a tow-truck.  In the dark.  Through Alps.  The show
				is somebody&apos;s 40th birthday surprise.  He has one leg.
				Whoooa.  Lix makes his live JBC debut.  Very loud.  Very
				exciting.  All drunk.  The whole town.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar10.html"><b>10.3</b>
				Innsbruck - <b>Utopia</b></Link> 200 people.  Back in the
				hotel where we were previously narrowly prevented from
				stealing the ducks.  No sign of any ducks this time.
				Dinner in the rudest restaurant in the world.  All think
				about biffing the propriator, but don&apos;t because he&apos;s
				Turkish and it wouldn&apos;t do to be misunderstood.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar11.html"><b>11.3</b>
				Vienna - <b>Szene Wien</b></Link> 300 people (more?)  Opening
				act is one &quot;Jac&quot;, a lone 19 year old Austrian who is
				brilliant.  JBC follow him on and open with {girls}, which
				Lix has just remembered a few minutes ago.  It, and
				all that follows it, walks a charmed route through chaos,
				and by the end of the night I am fairly sure that this
				was the best JBC show ever.  Many drunks, nightclubs.
				Kathie, Lix and I end up in the hotel manager&apos;s apartment.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar12.html"><b>12.3</b>
				Ebensee - <b>Kino</b></Link> Ebensee is reached down a
				lakeside road with bizarre gothic tunnels cut through
				forbidding rock faces, all decorated with ancient coats
				of arms.  &quot;Castle?  There is no castle HERE...&quot;  Dooj
				cracks two ribs cannoning into a p.a. stack.  We seize
				Gerard Langley&apos;s silly mic-stand, which he left here.
				We still have it and taunt him with it at regular intervals.
				Thousands of drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><Link href="/gigs/1993/Mar13.html"><b>13.3</b>
				Dornbirn - <b>Spielboden</b></Link> We close the tour in
				one of our favourite venues.  Two guitars and one amplifier
				loaded on the Love Bus in urgent need of some professional
				maintenance.  Notable for acapella rendition of <i>Winter
				Wonderland</i> enlivened by guitar roadie&apos;s fetching
				alto harmony.  She is not, however, yet expected to
				appear onstage with a lot of keyboards.  Drunks.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><b>14.3</b>	GREAT ROAD JOURNEYS OF HISTORY: We leave
				Dornbirn, on the Austro/Swiss border after a lengthly
				lunchtime beer session, during which it is agreed the
				We Still Love The Old World.  We arrive in Breda on
				the Dutch/Belgian border at midnight and go to <b>Zanetti&apos;s</b>
				to get irredeemably twisted.  We even stop for a proper
				dinner on the way.  This is not possible, but we did
				it anyway.
			</li>
			<div className="p-5"/>
			<li><b>15.3</b>	Go to Belgium, but a lot of cheap beer,
				miss two boats, go to the pub, get on the boat, get
				drunk, get paid (I got &#163;27!), go home.
			</li>
			</ul>

			<div className="p-5"/>
			<blockquote>
			VERDICT: Best European tour since <Link href="/gigs/1988/index.html">1988.</Link>
				Not as violent
				or drunk, but more mental and musical.  I felt that
				we really did a lot to remind people how good this thing
				can be, and the dates with Lix were Something Else.
				Funny how things turn out.
