		In the early aughts, Pat inadvertently assembled a supergroup - <b>Wilson</b> -
		with ex-Sumosonic members and well known Northampton musicians.
		<b>Wilson</b> layered guitar-riffs and shouty-pop over solid
		sequencing and live percussion. Nearly 100 live shows were played, and a live DVD was
		self-released at the end of a decade-long run.
