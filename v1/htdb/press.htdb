			Well John, thanks for that rather strange and touching experience, which carried me back to a time when we were largely happy if permanently pissed. It says much for our dedication to our art that we sound so pleased to be drinking Heineken. But who the hell is that posh bloke Eider and where did he get that accent? Also you have made me catch a few bars of some tracks I've been assiduously avoiding for the last 30 years or so. But thanks all the same for the memory and indeed the Heineken.)};;Max Eider;;;;2017-10-01$$,

Another rainy night in Maryland…
<p />
The second band to be interviewed by Background Noise Productions back in the mid 80's was The Jazz Butcher; specifically Pat Fish and Max Eider. Mad genius' both, and interestingly, part of the cosmic cat's cradle linking me to another mad genius who's as brilliant with pen and ink as they are with guitars. Eclectic, eccentric, acoustic, electric. The Jazz Butcher never really got their due, but I've had the good fortune of seeing them twice—and both times they were brilliant. The first concert, at the old 9:30 Club, followed a somewhat debauched, Heineken case-long interview in the Background Noise P Street Studios and, if memory serves me right, we ended up in a no-name Chinese restaurant for hours after the show. The second time, was at a much smaller venue in Arlington. Older, wiser, more sophisticated(?) Pat was greeting patrons at the door as if he was welcoming them into his house.
<p />
I wish the Jazz Butcher had cracked it back in the day when they were riding high on that wave of college radio popularity… but I suppose if they had… they wouldn't be one of my favorite bands. The Happy Medium Song of the Day is “Rain.” 
<p />
C'mon, it's April. Get over it — or as Pat would say… “pass us another Heineken, mate.”

		Live on the air with Julio Ruiz, the "Espanish John Peel". National radio, six in the evening. He played lots of tunes from Gentleman Adventurers. I played "Melanie Hargreaves' Father's Jaguar" and "Girlfriend". For the interview I had an interpreter. At one point she failed to translate whatever Julio said but it involved the words "Kevin Ayers, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan..." I enjoyed that bit, though, now I come to think about it, he was probably saying "This bloke is not as good as..."

	The promo schedule for Independence Day director Roland Emmerich
	is unrelenting. After Britain where the film took a record
	£6824163 in its first weekend, he moved to Barcelona, then Cannes.
	But on Tuesday, Emmerich will fly to La Puebla, a small town in
	Majorca, where there are no private screenings of the film (gross
	US takings $240 million), but there is a
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1996/Aug20.html">one-off show</a> by British
	cult pop band The Jazz Butcher (gross US takings - substantially
	less).
	<p />
	Emmerich was introduced to their garage rock'n'roll, laced with
	copious references to alcohol and cats, by James Duval, who plays
	fighter pilot Randy Quaid's son in Independence Day. Duval's
	Keanu looks - and survival of the alien firestorm - should ensure
	his part in the sequel (Thanksgiving Day).
	<p />
	Duval, who's Butcher adoration crosses the border of obsession,
	pestered Emmerich to invite the group's singer, ${pat}, to the
	film's London premiere.
	<p />
	And the band returned the favour by taking him drinking in
	Shepherd's Bush.
	<p />
	'It was weird', says Fish. 'Here's the guy in the biggest movie in the
	world and the highlight of his trip to London is meeting this
	group who no one over here could be bothered to arrest. He just
	kept saying how grateful he was'.
	<p />
	This unlikely adulation may force the group's record company,
	${creat}, to dust off some back catalogue, especially if Duval
	persuades Emmerich to use their songs in the directors projected
	remake of Godzilla.
	<p />
	Still, this is a band used to the inner circles of celebrity.
	Former drummer ${owen} emigrated and worked for 109 days as
	Günter Grass's gardner.

	formed... THE JAZZ BUTCHER. after a number of dodgy

	i asked myself, 'are we having fun? are we making money?'
	that was when i decided to stop playing and found that the
	others wanted to stop as well. next came a long succession
	of staying on people's floors and sponging off people. i fled
	to northampton and decided that i could write songs on my
	own, and did it. it all started from my own amusement on a
	two-track cassette player. then i met david "elvis" barker

	be much the same. after all, the jazz butcher line up has
	changed a few times. the old line - up which was basically

	Sikkorskis From Hell, from which came ${scandal} in '84,
	${sex} in '85, and eventually a new bassist Felix. ${nons} is
	their first U.S. release (Big Time Records). But the man I'd
	come to assume was the Jazz Butcher politely introduced
	himself as both ${pat} and Melonhead. Hmmm. You
	know what they say about assuming.
	<p />
	Such things don't really matter. In fact, it's this type of
	unpredictability that makes the Jazz Butcher what they/he
	are/is. You'll never be really certain what you're dealing
	with. They like to keep their audiences thinking; the
	melodies may be snappy little sing-a-longs, soulful ballads
	or jazzy lounge tunes, but their lyrics are about anything
	from Red Russians or the Devil to the skins of dead Jim
	Morrisons or heads of state. You won't get away with just
	dancing with this stuff. You may be smiling and your feet
	may be moving but your brain will be wondering, "what the
	hell is happening here!?"

	<div class="iview_a">
	<b>Jazz Butcher/Pat Fish/Melonhead</b>: (Rather indignantly)
	We've never had a hit in our lives! It's just an introduction.
	Dave (from Glass records) and I put it together, and its just
	sort of an introduction so people don't waste their money on
	expensive imports. I think its a fair enough introduction.
	Obviously, one can't really sort of condense the contents of
	three LP's and half a dozen singles onto one record, but it
	gives people an idea of what to expect.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	So you're going to get them with Bloody Nonsense
	and keep them with the new record?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, we're not interested in sort of getting them and
	keeping them. We don't look to make fans, we look to make
	friends with as best we can. It does seem that people that
	buy our records do stick with us. Its very flattering. The
	new LP has a couple of ${max} 's songs on it. My mother
	heard it and said, "You know, that bloke, its like rock n' roll
	never happened for him, isn't it?" And then she said, "Come
	to think of it, it's like jazz never happened either."

	What's the view of British bands that get American
	record deals? Is there resentment in the U.K. at all?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, that all depends if you like the band, doesn't it? I
	mean if some horrid, heavy metal band gets an American
	deal we just think, "Oh yeah, right, stadium rock, punching
	the air, eating hamburgers, and going whoop."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	All at the same time.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	All at the same time. I mean, God gave talents to
	everyone. No, I think... I can't speak for everyone, but most
	of the younger British groups are all in it for the right
	reasons. And if they're in it for the right reasons, then they
	like seeing someone they like being successful. Theres no
	sort of professional jealousy.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	The right reasons being...
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Ok, that's a good question. Obviously we enjoy doing it,
	right? And in the beginning we went to where anyone
	would listen--so we were doing it for ourselves, as well. I
	thing once you found that people were listening, the main
	thing is to bear in mind, not insult their intelligence. Bear in
	mind also, that, like it or not, you're in show business;
	you're in entertainment. People pay money, they cross town.
	We've been finding people in the states that've been driving
	two hours to see us. Apart from recommending a good
	analyst, all we can do is do our best--try to give these
	people a good time and send them away feeling positive,
	and not to waste their time. So many people are in this
	business basically to impress people.

	Well possibly. Everyone has points they want to prove.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	Do you consider it important to play what you want
	to? How much of a show is a job, a duty to please your
	audience, and a duty to please yourself?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	I think once you're at a concert..we think of it as a duty
	to please the audience. But the point is, if we're not pleasing
	ourselves, we'll get bored. And if we're bored, the audience
	is going to be bored..which is one reason why I'm never able
	to tell people what we'll be playing that night because we
	write the set list a half an hour before we go on. We try to
	change it every night. Its like a chess game; you have certain
	opening gambits--all these different choices.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	But I would imagine that your fans trust your
	judgement.

	<div class="iview_a">
	He's a favorite of mine too. Though dare I say, he's not

	Roadrunner I've been playing in garage bands for years
	'cause it's easy. But I think what really happened was that
	when I started writing what was to become Jazz Butcher
	material, I was listening almost exclusively to the ${vu}, and
	to an old soul compilation with Wilson Pickett, King Curtis..
	Memphis soul. I think Wilson Pickett is god-like.
	Those are the main influences. Then after awhile I noticed
	some of the songs I was writing were decidedly silly. And it
	made me think 'cause Lou Reed
	said that Richman was at more Velvets shows than
	Lou was. And I just thought, you know, silly white middle
	class college boys who listen to too much ${vu} and write
	stupid songs. I just felt an affinity. Obviously, I listen to
	Jonathan Richman and admire him immensely.

	I'm a right hero worshipper, honestly. If I ever met any

	got to go to New York after all these years of waiting to go
	there--to see the streets where Tom Verlaine and Lou Reed walked.
	Wow! I was in heaven in
	New York. But we were there two nights playing in
	Hoboken, and who was playing at the Ritz? Lou was playing

	There's a pint-size revolution up there on stage tonight, andThe Jazz Butcher have it by the scruff of its reluctant neckand are shaking the hell out of it.
	<p />
	The Butcher himself has been away for too long, and it's fineto welcome him bock — the original 'Mr Odd' in rose.tinted specs - with his tall tales and true, the stuff of plots hatched overendless cups of tea in shabby kitchens everywhere.
	<p />
	The only others brave enough to milk the mundane
	and discover those places where the quirks lurk are Momus
	and the dear old Television Personalities. They all have a
	way with the ordinary. But were Dan Treocy to sing about his
	neighbour dying, it would be pop at its most plangent,
	something twisted but still kind of teary. Let the Butcher
	at it and he's cashed the poor bastard's last giro and is
	laughing like a drain.
	
	<p />
	His heart's too big for savogery, though. We know he's softwhen he delivers Burglar Of Love" with the preface,"Here's one about that most heinous of crimes, or during atouching 'Party Time, where he and an aching sax are lonelymates in the crowd, knocking off the free lager and hopingsome girl will take them home.
	
	<p />
	The jagged throshy things are what really get us going tonight,
	but there's a look-no-hands piece of brilliantly sloppy rap
	that lurches along, and a big surprise in one slow-trawling
	slab of sleaze, all hip movement and blues-tinted fuzz
	guitar. Somehow sex is the last thing you expect from this
	strange and scruffy bunch.
	
	<p />
	If you're honest, there are more beards and dodgy cops onstage tonight than is quite decent, but you excuse themhappily. As you would any dear friend with enormous talent.

	After <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1988/Jun12.html">the solid, sweaty show</a>
	that he should be famous for,
	main Jazz Butcher conspirator ${pat} retreated to the
	Odd Rock parking lot for some serious interrogation. We began
	with the story of Pat's association with ${creat}
	kingpin Alan McGee.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"When the band first became a band," Pat begins, "(and)
	started to trim its lineup down to some kind of vaguely
	regular unit, in '84, one of the first places we used to go and
	play was this little club in London called The Living Room."
	<p />
	"The Living Room was kind of a peripatetic club - it
	moved about just really sordid little upstairs rooms and
	little small pubs, and the guy who ran it was this mad little
	Scots geezer called Alan McGee. And he used to wear these
	really crap corduroy trousers and big wooley jumpers that
	his mum had made him, and he used to talk in this
	impenetrable Scottish accent and none of us ever understood
	what he was saying."
	<p />
	"And I always knew him but we just sort of got going with
	Glass and, as ${creat} got more and more better known, I
	used to think, `The bastards. Bastards. Wish I was on
	Creation They're all pop stars on Creation.' In '85 we
	discovered Europe and we used to do a lot more work out
	there. In '86 we were doing Europe and here, and we didn't
	neglect England exactly, but England didn't quite pick up
	with us as much as a lot of places."
	<p />
	"At the end of '86. the old band just toured (themselves) to
	death within two years' touring, without really any rest at
	all. And the record company contract was up, and we just
	decided it was time to go out and get new lives. At which
	point, Alex, our sax player, who is conspicuous by his
	absence tonight, (with) family business at home to attend to,
	(and I) went out on a solo tour - well, duo tour - in Europe,
	just the two of us, just to see what would happen if we tried
	to do it."
	<p />
	"We got as far as Paris, McGee flew out, and said, `Eh, uh
	want teh sign yeh' and I said, `Fuckin' hell, McGee, you
	know, this has been a long time coming. I thought you'd
	forgotten who I was.'"
	<p />
	"But he hadn't, and there then followed about three months
	when we got really mucked about between him and the
	American record company, Big Time, who were really
	messing about. In the end, fortunately, we ended up with
	McGee, because if you look at what's happened to Max's
	solo album, Big Time have really screwed him up - ahem,
	ahem - big time, on that. It was ready at the beginning of
	February, and they put it out in October, and they've gone
	bust since, and they did no promotion on it."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	Jim Warchol looks surprised. Big Time is busted?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"They're down the tubes. There's one man left, and the man
	who bled them white for his own personal amusement.
	We all should have known because he only got
	the money to set up the label and as a result of his
	involvement with a band called Air Supply, so we should
	have known he didn't care about us."
	<p />
	"We should have known. He was offering us loads of
	money. And I can offer you loads of money now; doesn't
	mean I'll give it to you. Doesn't mean I even have it, you
	know. So we were lucky, in the end, to end up with McGee.
	We went through some pretty poverty-stricken times in the
	meantime."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	On ${creat}, the Jazz Butcher reside with several kindred
	spirits - Edwyn Collins, Nikki Sudden, ${scream}, and
	the ${weather}, for example. Pat found this new
	relationship useful when time came to record his first LP
	for the label:
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"McGee said, `Okay, let's make an album.' and I said,
	`Yeah, yeah, for God's sake. I've got millions of songs; let's
	go.' And I said, `But the thing is, we don't have a drummer.
	I can play bass, but we'll have to use a drum machine.' He
	said, `D'you want teh borrow the ${weather}?' And
	I'd been listening to She Comes from the Rain for about
	three months. For me, it was one of those records you can't
	get out of bed without playing. I just said, `You want to lend
	me the Weather Prophets?' `Aye, it'll cost ye 500 quid.'
	Five hundred quid, out of an LP, you know?" Pat sounds
	incredulous.
	<p />
	"So we had them and they were decent geezers. Greenwood,
	the bass player, tried to chat up my wife the other night, but
	fortunately fell down drunk in the middle of it, so there
	wasn't a problem."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	With ${49}, on the new LP, the Jazz Butcher have beaten the
	Blowtorch to the punch with rock & roll's first tribute to
	the great American author Thomas Pynchon. Pat has a great
	story about the post horn symbol that pervades the Pynchon
	novel The Crying of Lot 49.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"When you're touring Europe, it's really scary, because you
	keep seeing their signs everywhere. I'll tell you what we had
	a lot of trouble with. We were touring Spain and there was
	this shop - sold military medals and shit - and there was
	this one badge, it was red. And, in gold, it had the post
	horn, just like Lot 49, crossed out with rifles. I thought,
	`Whoa, this is Lot 49 stuff.'"
	<p />
	"So I bought it and I put it on my lapel. We were driving
	along, we stopped at a Spanish roadside cafe, and... as I
	walked in, everybody fell silent and looked at me with a
	really evil look. I though, `What've we done? I dunno. Did I
	shave today? I mean, is my fly undone? What's happening?'
	And we had this Spanish driver who was driving us around
	and he was getting very agitated. And he spoke to our
	Spanish road manager, who has a bit of English and he
	turned around and asid, `Um, that badge you're wearing,
	Pat.' I said, `Yeah?' `Better take it off, Pat.' `What is it?'
	`It's the National Guard.'
	<p />
	"Whoopsy-daisy, yeah, right, so that was off. But it's a
	great design, that. What the Spanish National Guard have
	got against Thurn & Taxis (the main European mail system
	from the 14th to the mid-19th centuries - their post horn
	symbol is of some significance in Lot 49) I can't tell you."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	We reminisce about my opening slot wherein the
	Chesterfield's bass player wandered about onstage,
	apparently looking for something. Pat seemed to enjoy the
	Chesterfields, despite a few initial misgivings.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I mean," he
	says, "a band that is supporting and turns up at 10:00 to do
	their soundcheck, you know, I mean, Sweet Jesus. I mean,
	give `em credit - they did just get up there and happen. To
	be fair to them... I thought they were going to be a load of
	wanky pop stars, and at least they were down-to-earth
	nutters, so that's to their credit, really."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	Has anybody asked you what you think of <b>The Best Kisser
	in the World</b> (former J.Butcher guitarist/vocalist

	"I dunno if they've asked me on tape. I think it's good. I

	It's that line - "Jesus, friend of the poor; Jesus, what do you
	take me for?"
	<p />
	"The thing about Max's songs is: lyrics are really pokey. It's
	almost as though his record company ought to put out press
	releases saying, `This song is about...' and then enjoy it."

	Butcher has rediscovered the ${bacon} LP (recorded 1982).
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"Well," Pat reasons, "the reason we're playing a lot off that,
	really, is that ${fishco} was made very much the same way,
	it's like Son of ${bacon}. It's like, y'know, we have a
	bunch of people who we didn't really know and who'd
	never heard the songs and it was like, `Right, you've got 20
	minutes. Make it happen.' So, in a way, we sort of
	developed a feeling for those old songs."

	"Don't forget ${perfect} album, Swar Wars,
	coming out on Fire Records this summer. If you like the
	${vu}, there's nothing wrong with it. From Germany there's
	a band called M Walking On The Water. They've got
	accordians. They sound like Violent Femmes, Tom Waits,
	${tops}, the JBC. They toured with the JBC. The

	"Our new record? It's like a postcard. A whole bunch of us
	went into the studio and we hadn't got the faintest idea what
	we were going to do, and we were there for two weeks, and
	that came out as a result. And it's like when you go on

	"${fishco} is a postcard. Which is why the photos of

	<div class="iview_outro">
	A final note, to all possible doubters: tonight's renditions of
	${angels} was so perfectly poignant as to provoke a second
	listen to the initially dismissed ${dist} (1986) LP, and upon
	that listen the whole damned thing sounded great. As great
	as any of the Jazz Butcher's seven albums of tuneful,
	heartfelt, and funny songs. So grab one - the man is down.

	The Jazz Butcher, having shown the occasional flash of
	brilliance, has finally come up with the goods. ${fishco} is
	that rare beast, an LP of cool, laid-back pop. With tracks
	imitating every current pop style the Jazz Butcher, always a
	fan of subtle humour, raps his way through a song about
	chickens and has a go at calypso.
	<p />
	Atmospherics are the name of the game here, with more
	than a hint of the Go-Betweens. The tunes have an
	addictive, subtle grip which tightens on each play, and
	vocals that are delightfully nonchalant. This is the ideal
	album to play when you're faced with a wet spring Sunday

	Like some weird, polka-dot undercoat to Simple Minds'
	<i>Street Fighting Years</i> suit of armour, The Jazz Butcher and
	his group are throwing off the traces of the past in their
	effort to echo the times.
	<p />
	The Butcher has been ridiculed as `whimsical' for years, but
	this set is dark as the backdrop of ten years of Thatch reign
	demands.
	<p />
	The vicious mismatch of outrage, black humour and
	sentiment bickers in the grooves as ever, but the tone is
	bitter - as if they sense the imminent compulsory purchase
	of their own spiritual off-license.
	<p />
	The thrashing pop of ${invent} sets it up, incorporating
	everything from Happy Shoppers through phone sex to the
	"Hit Man And Her" in a brilliant vignette of latterday UK
	ennul. ${hyst} takes the Butcher road ballad one step further
	and turns it into an ode to the lost culture and children of
	the USA.
	<p />
	That these two songs recall respectively Boston's <i>More
	Than A Feeling</i> and ${cale}'s <i>Ship Of Fools</i> gives some
	idea of both the Butcher's sense of pop humour and rock
	reverence.
	<p />
	A quintet of classics is completed by ${kid}, an hilarious,
	ugly-side-up exhumation of The Jam's <i>Saturday's Kids</i>,
	${being} - a sardonic bum's-eye view of the world,
	the human side of the begging hand at the bus stop - and
	${good}, a widescreen love song to life in the face of
	adversity.
	<p />
	Now for the wrist slapping.
	<p />
	There was a time when the Butcher could have cleaned up
	big with a surprise single. Whether he still cares is
	questionable, but the cluttered production on ${planet}
	suggests someone wants to cloud the issue for ever.
	<p />
	The samples and tape snippets pioneered on his last LP
	${fishco}, have got out of hand. They're always pertinent but
	on ${planet} they're far too profuse. Sure, it can be a gas but
	it seems to sap energy from their guitar-spangled rock.
	<p />
	And the reins could be pulled in slightly on their bizarre
	eclecticism - a superlative song like ${lineo} is stuffed with
	about three genres too many (samples, spaghetti westerns,
	and Balkan sea shanties?!). Simplicity has never been the
	Butcher's sole meat, but it's in danger of being chopped out
	of sight in places here.
	<p />
	That said, ${planet} , flawed though it is, could be the
	Butcher's finest hour. It proves him still one of the most
	underrated social commentators in these isles. Of course,
	some of us would say they've always been serious...

	The Jazz Butcher is ready to hack your limbs off with his
	social observations and political satire. But don't fight back
	and box him into a pseud's corner, because ${planet} is a
	devilish smalltown pop extravaganza.
	<p />
	Two words always spring to mind when listening to ${pat}
	and the Butchettes - Lloyd Cole. They cause a real
	commotion on tracks like ${invent}, with its Rattlesnakes
	guitar sound. Lyrically, this song is a wonderful critique of
	England - Fish despairs at "Sex On The Phone" and "The
	Hit Man And Her" (but do you blame him?) This is
	Thatcher's real Britain: all mod cons, alcoholism - a Tory
	twilight zone.
	<p />
	${lineo} initially about life in West Virginia, ingeniously
	electrifies Deliverance's dueling banjos and turns into a
	kind of Arab chant with echoing vocals.
	<p />
	This album sounds like it took years of meticulous
	composing and recording, rather like Cole's work, yet the
	JB's last album, ${fishco} , was released only a year ago!
	<p />
	A bit of jit git on The Word I Was Looking For mixes with
	sax and Housemartins small-pop to produce an up-tempo
	criticism of society's shallowness: "If ideas were legal
	tender, lots of people would be broke."
	<p />
	Fish has carved himself a real singer/songwriter niche for
	the nineties. Outstanding tracks including ${kid} - a
	Hitchcock-esque (${hitch}, not Alfred) look at growing up
	and new parental treatment. Fish almost despairing at the

	Forget Carter, the Jazz Butcher is the real unstoppable sex
	machine. "I'm a sex engine in my red and black pyjamas"
	croons this colossus of teenpop, and all say `aye' in
	agreement. Butch is as huge as Gorby on the continent,
	where German ladies queue to have his babies, but he
	remains puzzlingly confined to the culty bunker in this his
	native land. He certainly doesn't do jazz, nor indeed
	perform remarkable feats with cleavers and offal, but The
	Butcher has obviously munched a few Mad Cow burgers
	before he turned veggie. His slightly surreal worldview has
	earned him that reviled `wacky' tag but this is cacky dingos

	cobbler-togetherer of exceedingly good popular musical
	tunes to boot) with the same mucky brush as the likes of

	question here is `why, exactly?') will mark you out for life
	as a cauliflower-eared bog-brained dolt, so there. Go take a

	inventiveness?" and those will be your exact words, just
	trust me on this one, OK? So it's only right and natural for
	FOAF8s roving psycho-analytically team to surreptitiously
	drill a few holes in this chap's bonce and take a glimpse into
	his reasonably remarkable mind...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	FOAF: What has the Jazz Butcher been up to lately??
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Butch: From October to Christmas we toured the USA and
	Canada, driving coast to coast and back. ${richard} became a
	rock god, ${pat} (the Butcher himself - Ed) kept getting
	arrested for terrorist offences, ${larry} was diagnosed as the
	Jazz Butcher Conspiracy's first Case History, ${paul}
	made friends and the ${rev} spread the gospel of Lurve
	throughout the land. We played some concerts, too, and
	recorded a `lost' radio session for Doerdre O'Donoghue's
	`SNAP' in Los Angeles.
	<p />
	In January we retreated to a remote farmhouse (It was really
	a basement...) and, safely closeted with The Evil Dead,
	recorded ${cult}. The studio was positively overrun with
	stray American women. ${kizzy} returned from hospital and
	contributed some filthy noises. ${lix} of ${aero} put in his
	two-penn'orth and Richard and I did the rest of the guitars.
	Paul and Laurence and Alex did what they do and the Rev
	Botus played with the fax machine, overseeing the rapid
	spread of his church (?) (Ed's note - you may not have a
	teeny clue who these people are, but soon you will love
	them as if they were your own hamsters).
	<p />
	In February we played at Dingwalls, found it full of
	Japanese people (eerie) and promptly set out for Europe,
	where we stayed, playing concerts and speaking in tongues,
	until the beginning of May. Not long returned to England,
	we all climbed on board an aeroplane and went off to
	Austria (scene of some of our best concerts EVER) to play a
	vastly congenial pop festival. We played the Powerhaus in
	London on the night that Robson's Donkeys were finally
	and justly thrown out of the Campionate del Mundo Itailia
	90 (OOOh how controversial! - Ed).
	<p />
	I've been writing and recording at home, and have
	contributed a flute solo (!) to the new ${space} LP. Laurence
	has done some work on ${astor}'s album. Richard has
	been working closely with ${sonic}, with a view to
	starting a band (to be called `Sun', we think), and has also
	been working as producer with The Telescopes. There has
	also been some clandestine activity involving the JBC and
	DJ Steve Proctor.
	<p />
	You DID ask!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Why do you think you're still ignored in this
	country despite your Christ-like status among our European
	chums and Those Americans?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Christ-like? What are you calling me, a hippy? I
	haven't owned a pair of sandals since I was seven, thank you
	very much.
	<p />
	The media in this country are probably the chief culprits.
	There's no way that a seven-year-old act like the JBC is
	suddenly going to attract the attention of a press
	establishment which is falling over itself to find the Next
	Big Thing before a competitor does. Our time for being
	`discovered' was probably around 1984 but that was the
	time we'd just discovered Europe. We had so much fun
	there that we stayed out of the country until we were
	considered `old news'. Besides, this country is crazed for
	mediocrity. See the way that a TV game show audience
	goes "Whooooooooooo!" in that repulsive fashion if one of
	the contestants admits to having a job more demanding than
	check-out girl or warehouse packer. Ignorance is in fashion,
	and I'm afraid we don't really make records for the
	ignorant.
	<p />
	In other countries there is more access to the airwaves, more
	time between issues of the press (which, I suspect,
	encourages a more reflective attitude in the writers), more
	prosperity, and more people prepared to make a little
	commitment and put something of themselves into their
	leisure and entertainment. The result? We do all right. In
	the real world we do alright. (cc. Nicholas Ridley (ex) MP).

	<div class="iview_q">
	Where would you emigrate to?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Czechoslovakia. A pop musician with a reputation
	for being `literate' and `subversive'? With a University
	degree in philosophy? And a serious love of beer? Bloody
	hell! I should rate a major position in the Ministry Of The
	Interior with that lot! Whimsical or what? And Pilsner
	Urquell at 20p a litre? Imagine how far my publishing
	advance would go!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Yes indeed. What makes the Jazz Butcher don his
	Boogie Shoes?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Atmosphere. I love a party with a happy
	atmosphere. Soundtrack for Boogie Shoes? Well..... Gary
	Clail's Beef, Three Feet High and Rising, Weatherall's
	<b>Glider</b> remixes, Can, Fool's Gold, Hallelujah, Asian
	Youth Gang (Who? -Ed), James Brown, Franco and
	Rochereau (RIP Tabu Lay), David Rudder (look, don't ask
	me, I just type this stuff up - harrassed Ed), home-made
	stuff by ${rolo} and myself. Mind you, I've not
	been out a lot lately, I'm not doing a whole lot of dancing
	right now. I'm listening to a lot of Beefheart, Can (again),
	Alex Chilton, Beach Boys and the new (deeply acoustic)
	albums by ${dj} and ${hitch}. Both recommended, by the
	way.

	<div class="iview_q">
	The state of the world, Comment.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, nil desperandum, eh? New friends and a
	chance to recognise and confront a few old enemies, I
	suspect. Great hopes for Mandela, Gorbachev, Oskar
	LaFontaine and Vaclav Havel. Deep suspicion of Boris
	Yeltsin and the Baltic republics. Sympathy for Erich
	Honnacker and the British passport holders of Hong Kong
	who are unlucky enough not to be white and/or rich.
	Cynicism over Cory Aquino clone in Nicaragua. An abiding
	loathing for Thatcher, De Klerk, Quayle and Heseltine. I
	think it's wrong to say capitalism has `won'. I think we
	should keep our hopes up and our eyes open. These are,
	without doubt, interesting times. (and if this interview had
	been done a week later, I'm sure a Certain Problem in the
	Persian Gulf would have got a going over, too - a once
	again interrupting Ed).
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Do you think you're in danger of becoming an
	anachronism in this age of baggy dancing crossovers and
	spaciously-trousered hip gyrations?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, I've never actually been fashionable (except
	perhaps in the USA, which is a situation beyond my
	comprehension) so I'm not worried. We're the same kind of
	anachronism as good quality suits or shoes in an age when
	everybody is cramming into Top Man or Dolcis. I don't feel
	particularly cut off from the idea of wearing colourful
	clothes and making music you can dance to. I've always
	been into that. I felt more `stranded' in the days of Goff,
	really.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	A few words of advice for your legions of devoted
	fans?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I think the big word is probably "LISTEN". You
	can't do SHIT is you don't listen. It's very unfashionable at
	the moment, which is why so many unscrupulous scumbags
	are getting away with so much. But really, it's essential.
	Don't listen - don't learn. Don't learn - get fucked over.
	Again.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_outro">
	So there you have it. Strong words and true from a `rock
	and roll dissident, or heretic maybe'. Catch one of his
	spleen-bursting groovular live shows or nip out to the
	Co-op and snap up one of his super records as soon as you
	can spare the moments necessary, the Jazz Butcher should be
	squeaking Chart Bound Sounds sharpish and let's all hype
	him onto TOTP right damn now!. He can wobble his
	trousers with the best of 'em.

	the tour with Richard Formby taking Kizzy's place. When

	We were still completely mad, and this kind of basement

	it is. On this tour we've got a 21 year old wunderkind
	named ${jules} taking his place. We met Julian through the
	${aero}. ${lix}, one of their guitarists, does some great stuff
	on our new LP. When we were recording, he kept saying,
	"Oh, I've got this friend who's better than me!" That was
	Julian, and it's mad really. Julian is miles away the youngest
	of our group.

	Your albums have-from time to time-included
	some rather unusual names among the credits, and I'm
	sometimes not sure if its you or someone else.
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
	but the truth.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	${loony}, the person credited with the album
	covers of ${cult} and ${planet}.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Pascal? Yeah, Pascal's from Paris. We call him
	Jean-Pierre Looney because he is quite mad. He first came
	to us in 1986 and offered us a massive painting at a gig in
	France. It was like a cave painting, the sort of thing you'd
	see in a cave, of a male figure with gigantic-how can I say
	this? - Ladies bits up his chest.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Red dots?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes, a gigantic red dot right up its chest. Phil, our
	manager, looked at me and said, "Pat, I think he's trying to
	tell you something."
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	And you kept in touch?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Eventually, yes. At first, we just dismissed him as a
	complete looney. We hacked that painting to pieces and
	threw it away. I later discovered that they're worth about L
	1,000. each. Pascal does all kinds of stuff. He's working with
	Tom Waits at the minute, and ${cale}
	is a friend. Pascal's just a weird pushy French artist
	who likes rock and roll. Those are his feet on the cover of
	Cult of the Basement.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	${damm}....
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	There are these three Von Dämmerung brothers.
	They're from Vienna. They have a fanzine called <b>Sinful
	Beat</b>. They're completely deranged. Karel wrote the liner
	notes for ${cult}. He has a band now with his
	brothers Emil and Otto. They call themselves ${eg}. and
	the spell egg "e-g." It's just heinous. Musically, its really
	just an amateur bedroom version of the Justified Ancients of
	Mu (an early Bill Drummond group which relied heavily on sampling).
	They're completely diseased Central European lunatics. In
	an earlier age, they would have been burned at the stake. I
	love em'.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	They seem right in sync with ${cult}.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Oh, they're right into it! Karel actually came by when
	we were recording it. He was into all this jackal-headed
	dead business, Kizzy's "Hero of Chernobyl" haircut, and all
	the rest of it. By the time Karel showed up for the
	recording, Kizzy was out of the hospital and had had
	radiation treatment. His hair had fallen out and...oh, God.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Mr Odd....
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Mr. Odd is a real person. He's a funny, solitary old
	chap. The day after we finished recording ${odd}, Harry, the
	owner and proprietor phones us up and says that he's just
	found Mr. Odd decomposing. Mr. Odd was dead, and he
	lived in the basement next door. I mean this is really the
	death album.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Madame....
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	${daycare} is about Madame's policy to turn people out
	of asylums and care homes and leave them to wander the
	streets, a policy she laughingly calls care in the community.
	It's just basically a song about poor old boys who cant look
	after themselves. It's one of the albums token sincere
	numbers. And before you all write in and complain or
	throw stuff, the title of the song was just floating around the
	studio. We were taking the red dot out of Sonic Youth, a
	band we admire intensely.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Is "Madame" the same woman who is behind the
	English Poll Tax?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Oh, yeah.

	<div class="iview_q">
	Any thoughts on that?

	<div class="iview_a">
	Only one: red dot. It's so fatuous. It's beyond medieval.
	It's laughable. Fortunately, no ones paying it.

	<div class="iview_q">
	Has there been any anti-German sentiment in
	England since the reunification of East and West Germany?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes, there has been some discontent, but it basically
	comes from people who have never been to Germany,
	people who don't realize that for the most part Germany is
	what Britain should have been by now if it had not taken an
	appalling turn. In Germany, people remember that rights
	carry obligations and vice versa.
	<p />
	In Britain, its "I want it! Don't touch me!" It's just kinda
	sick. But still, anyone who's got his head brain wired up
	right is going to be a little bit concerned about German
	reunification and how it's managed. Not least, no doubt, the

	Led by Oxford philosophy graduate ${pat} with ${kizzy}
	(guitar), ${larry} (bass), ${paul} (drums),
	The Butcher have created a world of grace, hailstorms,
	all-night bus rides, brand new life forms, bloodlust, and
	pheramones... a place where even defenceless bunny rabbits
	aren't safe.
	<p />
	After a period of hungry obscurity, The Jazz Butcher began
	1988 with a new LP, the celebrated ${fishco} for a new label,
	the equally celebrated ${creat}. With
	critically-acclaimed albums such as ${nons} (a compilation
	of tunes recorded between 1983-86), and ${dist} under their
	belts.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher's new touring outfit hit the concert trail.
	By Easter Sunday, the band found themselves at the gates of
	Vienna, speaking an incomprehensive self-styled
	"Surrealist Rhyming Slang" (it doesn't rhyme) and gabbling
	darkly about the "Fishpower Uprising".
	<p />
	After completing a highly successful tour across Britian and
	Europe that took in some 50 cities, the band turned their
	attentions westward, and the summer of '88 found them on
	a lengthly club and college tour through the USA and
	Canada. Some three-quarters of the North American dates
	sold out.
	<p />
	On return to the UK, The Butcher ducked out of view to
	work on songs for the next LP, and little was heard from the
	group beyond a strange "acid shed" single called ${spook}.
	<p />
	This was soon followed by a brief but utterly deranged tour
	of Ireland. Really, nothing new.
	<p />
	As 1989 got under way the band turned to recording,
	emerging occasionally to confuse British audiences with a
	batch of previously unheard songs which would eventually
	come to comprise the ${planet} LP. The Jazz Butcher
	members also engaged in various collaborations with other
	artists: drummer ${paul} appeared on The Times LP
	<b>Beat Torture</b> and on the debut single from Joss
	Cope's Something Pretty Beautiful: ${larry}
	bassists, rehearsed and recorded with ${astor}.
	Meanwhile, The Butcher himself worked with ${sonic}
	of the ${space} , both on his solo LP and on the
	${space}'s <b>Playing With Fire LP</b> and 13 Frightened Girls,
	and in concert with ${aero}. He also found time to play a
	handful of solo acoustic shows in
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1989/Jun6.html">London</a>,
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1989/Apr6.html">Paris</a>,
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1989/Jul7.html">Hamburg</a>
	and <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1989/Jul6.html">Berlin.</a>
	<p />
	Finally, in September 1989, ${planet} was ready for release,
	complete with a custom-made sleeve by Parisian artist
	${loony}. Half-mad with the unaccustomed summer
	heat and effects of their own dubious recreational activities,
	The Jazz Butcher reassembled and started on a string of
	British dates, which is when things started to get seriously
	weird.
	<p />
	${kizzy} had to leave. The Jazz Butcher called
	old friend ${richard}
	to help out as emergency guitarist. Richard
	normally runs a studio in Leeds, where he has engineered
	and produced such "on-the-way-up" groups as the
	Telescopes and Cud.
	Stepping in to contend with the title of "Northerner Of The
	Group", Richard gamely subjected himself to a ruthless
	regime of sleeplessness, violence and excess as the band
	blundered on in a crazed attempt to complete their live
	English commitments. After only a few dates, it became
	clear that he was suited to this sort of thing, and then he
	appeared as a regular member of The Jazz Butcher.
	<p />
	After a long and successful tour of North America, The Jazz
	Butcher came home...
	<p />
	While working again solo with some old friends (Phil
	Parfitt of ${perfect}, this time) The Jazz Butcher prepared a
	new LP preceded by the languorous single ${girlgo} in June
	'90.
	<p />
	${cult}, Pat Fish's weirdest brain child to date, followed
	soon after. A Mix of pretty, easy melodies and subversive
	images with amazing titles and rhymes. The LP got
	extremely good reviews from extremely disturbed
	journalists.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher, after a unique London gig in July, are
	getting ready for a new North American tour.
	<p />
	God only knows what they'll be up to after.

	<div class="iview_a">
	"You will laugh .. I've just been through the longest downer

	We find further on in the pages of this self-examinatory

	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I have always loved collecting records - from ${richman}
	to King Crimson .. (laugh) I have had three collections in

	Later, in a slightly less depressive part of the interview, Pat

	an overdose, won't you? ) Not knowing where he was on
	about, I replied `You like seeing your favorite stars die,
	don't you'. He looked at me and said in a vicious voice (Ya,
	ya, It really cracks me up....) Another time in Spain, this
	bloke came up to see me after a show and told me that I had
	saved his life, that he was a heroin addict but he kicked it
	thanks to my records. That day I felt that my music was at

	The Jazz Butcher, pop musician, pop psychologist and
	poultry aficionado, has no idea why he's, as they say in the
	biz, "big in Canada." He does have a few typically outre
	guesses, though.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	"It may be some weird atavistic colonial thing," muses the
	Butcher, better know to his fellow townsfolk as ${pat}.
	"Perhaps they think there's a spirit of the old country going
	on. It's a totally mad place, though. You go up there and
	they're speaking French and spending dollars that have a
	picture of the Queen of England on them!"
	</div>
	<p />
	Ever since the release of his first record, ${bacon}, in 1982,
	Pat's been frequently shunted off into the corner where
	Britain keeps its charming rustic eccentrics. The trouble is,
	aside from the odd ode to the might capon (like 1986's
	${best} or slyly subversive mini- biographies (like ${smiff}
	that image is not at all that accurate. His albums range from
	the introspective acoustic murmurs of ${dist} to the
	comparatively balls-out rock of his work with the
	Sikkorskis From Hell. On more recent releases, including
	this year's ${cult}, he's even managed to get these diverse
	stylings to coalesce into a reality-grounded dreamscape -
	the kind of thing you don't have to like college radio to
	enjoy.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"We've never seen ourselves as an indie band," Pat insists.
	"But I suppose not many people write songs about goldfish
	and shit like that. Actually, I've never written songs about
	goldfish either - I've written songs about people who've
	said I had to write songs about goldfish. Or is that a bit too
	post-structuralist?"
	</div>
	<p />
	Well, yes. As you may have guessed by Pat's
	synapse-vaulting trains of thought, The Jazz Butcher's
	evolution has really been more of a convolution. Over the
	years, scores of folks have drifted in and out of the various
	permutations that have backed Pat on disc and live. The
	most successful of those was his several-LP association
	with the shadowy ${max}, himself a rustic eccentric of the
	first order. Perhaps the oddest, though, was when ex-${haus}
	bassist ${dj} signed on.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"In a way, he's one of the least odd," Pat demurs. "We've
	known each other locally for years, and we have quite a lot
	in common. It must have looked very strange to see one of
	the Undead playing on this thing they keep trying to tell you
	is a comedy record - which of course it isn't."
	</div>
	<p />
	${cult} might
	be the darkest Jazz Butcher record yet, in spite of its
	smattering of "gibbon's-eye view humour," to use his
	phrase. But considering the circumstances surrounding its
	creation, that shouldn't be too surprising.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"We'd just had a
	guitar player taken from under our feet with brain
	tumours," Pat recalls. "Everyone was really freaking out -
	one minute it was like total doom and gloom and the next
	frantic, over the top dancing.
	<p />
	"It also has something to do with the fact that it was made
	entirely at night in the middle of winter, while we were
	listening to Big Star's 3rd album - a record that was so commercial it
	wasn't even released! And people ask me about success!"
	</div>
	<p />
	That's a subject he doesn't mind addressing. He's fully
	aware that his fall/winter tour of the U.S. won't be counted
	among 1990's top moneymaking juggernauts. He even jokes
	that his prolific output is the result of a "complete lack of
	quality control," though his dedicated devotees might
	disagree. There's only one question that he's yet to sort out
	- is The Jazz Butcher a group? He thinks long and hard.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"The Jazz Butcher," he finally decides, "is Debbie Harry."

	Led by Oxford philosophy graduate ${pat} and featuring a
	dazzling array of co-conspirators including ${kizzy}
	(guitar), ${larry} (bass), and ${paul} (drums),
	The Jazz Butcher have created a world of grace, hailstorms,
	all-night bus rides, bloodlust and new life forms on their
	previous releases.
	<p />
	With the release of ${blue} - an all-new 9 song collection of
	driving rockers, big beat ballads and moody atmospherics -
	The Jazz Butcher's latest step across the Atlantic should
	substantially expand the movement some have labeled "the
	Fishpower uprising."
	<p />
	${blue} has been praised for its "spiky wordplay and uncanny
	tune-touch." With such song titles as ${monkey} and
	${girls}, the record leaps through topics ranging from
	politics ("You want my votes, you'll have to pay me") on
	${filth}; to love ("All that honey ever wants is someone to
	watch Twin Peaks with") on ${honey}; to warped
	double-entendre ("I've had a thing about Shirley Maclaine
	since I was so high") on ${shirl}. Musically, ${blue} jumps
	from speakers on the melodically grungy single
	${yo}, but spans sombre ballads, pure pop guitar licks,
	horns, coy backing vocals and a little bit of cha-cha-cha to
	boot. The ideas may be tongue in cheek and pure British
	wit, but there are some heartfelt emotions running just
	under ${blue} winsome surface.
	<p />
	<a href="${jbc_press}/91select.html">Select Magazine
	in England calls ${blue} "a creative high"</a>
	in a career with many high points: 1988's celebrated
	${fishco}; the follow-up ${planet}; the recent ${cult}; the
	${closet} compilation. The Jazz Butcher's eclectic mix of
	off-hand observations and inventive melodies have made
	the group a staple of alternative radio playlists.
	<p />
	After a period of hungry obscurity (which yielded the
	critically acclaimed ${nons} and ${dist} albums), The Jazz
	Butcher began 1988 with a new record for a new label:
	${fishco} for ${creat} UK. Following a lengthly
	tour - highlights of which included Easter in Vienna,
	sold-out dates in North America and the invention of
	"Surrealist Rhyming Slang" (it doesn't rhyme!) - The
	Butcher returned to British soil to work on songs for what
	would later become ${planet}.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher members also engaged in various
	collaborations with other artists during this period -
	drummer ${paul} appeared on The Times LP
	Beat Torture and the debut single for Joss
	Cope's group Something Pretty Beautiful; rehearsed and
	recorded with ${astor}; while The Butcher himself worked
	with ${sonic}, ${space}'s <b>Playing With Fire</b> and in
	concert with ${aero}.
	<p />
	Half mad from various and sundry extracurricular
	activities, the Jazz Butcher reassembled in late 1989 and
	started on a string of British dates that saw ${kizzy}
	replaced by longtime Butcher pen pal, guitarist
	${richard}. Another long and successful American tour
	followed before the Butcher and company returned home
	for more outside work (this time with Phil Parfitt of
	${perfect}) and preparation of the languorous single ${girlgo}
	in June of 1990.
	<p />
	${cult}, Pat Fish's weirdest brain child to date, followed
	soon after. The record again received rave reviews from
	some extremely disturbed journalists. Following yet another
	extensive American tour, The Butcher went into hiding at
	home, writing songs for the next studio outing. As usual, the
	other members concentrated on outside project - Laurence
	with Terry Biker's Levetation and Paul with ${aero}.
	<p />
	In the meantime, a compilation LP called ${closet} (don't
	ask, because we don't know) was released, which included
	their best tunes from 1987 to 1990 like ${spooky} and the
	jubilant ${drugs}.
	<p />
	Which leaves us at the present - ${blue}'s release in the UK

	It is only fate, and perhaps the Jazz Butcher's daft name (he
	doesn't play jazz, and mutilation is not his forte), that has
	made ${hitch} the English eccentric college-rock favorite,
	and Mr. Butcher (real name: ${pat}) not.

	On his latest LP, the attention-grabbing songs are the

	"We don't play jazz and we don't eat meat, that's about it,"
	says ${pat}, aka Butcher (or vice versa), lead whosit of the
	Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, heretoforth known as just plain
	Jazz Butcher. "I do actually have, now, meat eaters in the
	group which I'm not crazy about, but we'll work on them. I
	was a meat eater when we started the group. The others
	worked on me. It's just part of the system of infiltration,
	here and so forth. I personally don't really hold with meat."

	And thus a conversation with the Jazz Butcher begins, not to
	wax eloquent on the fine intricacies or cadences of the
	recent ${blue}, (Sky Records, 1992), or to discuss the subtle
	ironies of ${cult} (Rough Trade, 1990), nor even to extricate
	the inflections found on ${closet} (${creat}, 1991). No, a
	conversation with the Jazz Butcher - which doesn't, by the

	progenitors of the very artform his name encompasses -
	relies wholly on the metaphorical. Basically, what it all

	<p />
	The number of recorded material Fish and his merry bunch
	of assorted musicians that have coerced with him in the past
	have outnumbered the amount of space there is for this
	intro. Let's just say that first known Jazz Butcher recording
	happened upon us in 1982. From there various conspiracies
	have sprouted, including one in which Max Eider figures
	prominently. At present, ${blue} is the hot item with its
	varieties of musical tones from a bit o' guitar pop to
	garagey, British-style numbers. You can catch Jazz Butcher
	at the <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1992/Apr24.html">Georgia Theatre, Friday,
	April 24</a>. Phoning Pat in
	London, a very expensive interview indeed (but well worth
	it for the amusing conversation!), he spoke about
	understanding just what it is that makes up Jazz Butcher...
	<p />
	"You just don't understand the Jazz Butcher..."
	(concert-goer <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1990/Nov16.html">in Atlanta at

	<div class="iview_a">
	"This guy, my friend ${astor}, he comes up after a gig we
	did together and he says, `That's gothic!' I was about to fell
	him with a single blow when he says, `As in Shelley not as
	in Bauhaus!' And as a result we've been hamming it up ever
	since. He's a great songwriter. I love him. We did a tour
	around Germany and Austria just before Christmas. It was
	his tour. He organized the tour. It was his crew, his crew's
	bus. Three of us sat in the back with our drinking and our
	suitcases and made hell for them, including 90 percent of
	the venues. It was great."
	</div>
	<p />
	Many different drummers...

	<div class="iview_a">
	"There's a very small gang of us in England around the

	[Langley], ${aero}'s front man, because he doesn't play
	anything, regards it all with deep suspicion, and refers to us
	as `mafia' because no one makes any money. I'll go play on
	${sonic}'s record, ${richard} will come and
	play with me. The question of payment if just out the
	window. We'll drink and have a smoke, put each other up,
	and just make the music. Each of us has some sort of central
	project where we put our own records out and get some
	money. Each of us, at any time, there'll be a `paid' band.
	The people come together in all sorts of different

	Aspects of `grouping'...
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"Whenever England attempts to impersonate America they
	get it completely wrong. Even today. Imaging in the '50s
	when there were no fax machines - I think when they got a
	hold of rock'n'roll they said - `Oh, I see, I get the point.
	You have your group and I have my group and group is
	better than your group because they're higher in the charts.'
	And if they turn it all into this kind of '50s, British,
	repressed, school competition kind of thing, which is like
	the whole concept of grouping I just find so totally
	tiresome."
	<p />
	"We're making music here, and we're not fools. We
	wouldn't go out and do it in front of people unless we
	thought it was something worth playing for. I think
	honestly, people that come from the original days of
	rock'n'roll, if you dug them out in a bar somewhere and
	talked to them about it, they'd pretty much give you the
	same schpiel. I think it's the commercialization thing that's
	caused people to band together in disparate little groups for
	mutual ego support, and so forth. And lots of money. If I
	want to make lots of money I'll get a real job, you know. It's
	not like I didn't go to college or anything."

	<p />
	Hitchcock comparisons...

	<div class="iview_a">
	"What could I tell about ${hitch}? He writes in code, and it's
	my proud boast to have never written anything that can't be
	said in ordinary speech at a bus stop. Of course, having said
	it, someone might say he's a bit odd. At least it could be
	said, and it would make sense as an English sentence. I think
	his lyrics are quite good, and I think his guitar playing is
	beyond belief, totally underrated guitar player. We don't do
	the same thing, anymore than I do the same thing as the Kinks,
	or XTC, or anybody else. `Cause it's just coming from one
	guy, it's just me doing that."
	<p />
	"It's great when you go to a show and someone says, `I
	thought you were great.' And then they say, `Have you
	heard the new ${cale} album?' You sort of like, get off
	on that. It's always nice. It makes you think you're doing it
	for a reason, it's worthwhile, apparent, and clearly
	worthwhile to other people, which is really rewarding."

	<p />
	A matter of expression...
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"It's very nice for all of you to contribute to my therapy
	[laughs]. It really is. People are paying me to do my therapy,

	I'm not Daniel Johnson, or anything. I don't like people to
	think I'm a professional looney for fun and profit because

	${pat} has a special trap laid for anyone who thinks they
	know what to expect at
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1992/May6_2000.html">tonight's Jazz Butcher concert.</a>
	<p />
	Fish, professionally enigmatic leader of the carefully
	obscure British pop band hates people who think they know
	what to expect.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"You know that sort of dreadful rock ritual where they
	recognize the songs so they applaud you for playing
	something they've heard," Fish says over the phone. "So
	we've come armed with this show, which basically takes
	your expectations and stabs them to death within the first
	five minutes."
	</div>
	<p />
	The better to further Fish's reputation as an immensely
	sardonic, world-weary character of life's little absurdities.
	<p />
	Melancholic and extreme
	<p />
	Fish's alter ego, the Jazz Butcher, has produced a series of
	charming tunes wedded to stark, eerie lyrics in a
	progression of fringe-friendly albums since the eraly '80s.
	<p />
	His latest album, ${blue}, fits well into that tradition. It's a
	cheery collection of hummable ditties about the insanity
	that looms when a relationship falls apart.
	<p />
	And though the band does make a point of playing the tunes
	differently onstage, Fish says the album's dark mood
	translates to live performances.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"What we're doing is melancholic and extreme... With a
	show like this you do need to actually listen and pay some
	kind of investment before you're going to get anything out."
	</div>
	<p />
	Not that Fish wants to scare his audience away for the fun
	of it.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I'm not after being deliberately obscure. I don't want
	to make music that's just for one generation of
	19-year-olds to have as their special little secret."
	</div>
	<p />
	Music audiences, even those in the alternative crowd
	who've been more likely than the suit-and-tie set to buy
	Jazz Butcher albums are among the many subjects that
	arouse profound skepticism in Fish.
	<p />
	Many young people today "just use (music) as a kind of
	fashion accessory," he says.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"You get kids who are pissed
	off at their parents because they couldn't borrow the
	Camaro or something and they require a big, loud, scary
	noise which makes them feel better about not liking their
	Dada for a week."
	</div>
	<p />
	Just another silly name
	<p />
	Not all his fans are insufferable, he's quick to add, and
	crowds at the latest Jazz Butcher shows seem much more
	interested in the music.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher moniker was just one of a hundred silly
	names Fish and a friend discussed in a barroom chat one
	day, along with gems like Tammy Raviloi and her Jumping
	Vermicelli.
	<p />
	But Fish slapped the Jazz Butcher name on a basement tape
	that became an album almost by accident, and the rest is
	history.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"As long as people realize that we don't play jazz and I don't

	${pat}, perhaps better known as British thinking-person's
	popster The Jazz Butcher, is on a personal mission to bring
	literacy back to pop music.
	<p />
	The Butcher, who performs tonight at <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1992/May7.html"><b>Zaphod
	Beeblebrox</b></a> ($8 cover), is aware that he's fighting an uphill
	battle. Historically, those who attempt thought-provoking
	writing in a pop setting without being pretentious or
	willfully obscure often tend to get ignored, misunderstood
	or worse.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"They're usually taken out in the streets and stoned to death
	by an angry mob," says Fish, only half-joking.
	<p />
	"That's what you get for trying to not insult people's
	intelligence and writing something that will withstand more
	than one or two listens."
	<p />
	"Bands go in a studio and spend tens of thousands of dollars
	getting exactly the right guitar sound. They get the snare
	drum sounding absolutely perfect. They build this beautiful,
	sleek, shiny vehicle, then in comes the singer who sings
	some stuff written in crayon on the back of an envelope in
	10 minutes."
	</div>
	<p />
	So far, Fish has managed an uneasy nine-year, seven-album
	alliance with a music industry that's all about selling
	product, something that he's never been very interested in.
	<p />
	He remains vigilant and outspoken about the state of
	songcraft in pop music, fully aware that he's perceived to be
	"upsetting the apple cart."
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"Everything in pop music is becoming very undemanding
	and very predictable," says Fish.
	<p />
	"I don't really want a part of a culture which uses leisure as
	an instrument of social control. I don't want a part of a
	stupid, meaningless spectacle. I want our audience to think
	of themselves as men and women, boys and girls, not
	consumers."
	</div>
	<p />
	In the mid-'80s, The Jazz Butcher's crafting of very British,
	jokey songs sometimes got the better of him in the "overly
	precious with tongue firmly planted in cheek" department.
	Fish still has vivid memories of a Barrymore's concert in
	1988 when some 50 frenzied fans in front of the strange
	began chanting ${devil}, the title of one such
	song.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"It was like a full-scale satanic rally going on," says a
	still-incredulous Fish.
	</div>
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher's latest album, ${blue}, was inspired by a
	nervous breakdown Fish experienced towards the end of
	1990 that left him "barking, furniture chewing,
	down-on-all-fours mad."
	<p />
	The "barefaced and literal" songs, expressing Fish's
	observations as he worked to claw his way back to sanity,
	were "hell to write but a great pleasure to record," he says.
	<p />
	"My carefree vaudeville days are behind me," says Fish.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"We're making more demands on our audience these days.
	It's a very slow, glacial, beautiful Gothic sound."
	<p />
	"${creat} (the Jazz Butcher's British label) put out books as
	well, going fishing for interesting things that are out of
	copyright. So now I'm on the same label as Edgar Allan Poe
	and Marquis de Sade. That's my kind of Gothic."

	Any seasoned Jazz Butcher fan will probably react, upon seeing the band's current lineup, with a hearty "Where's Max?" Ever since the first single the JB's appeal has been largely based on the partnership between the dark-sunglassed singer/guitar-strummer, "the Butcher" (now referred to as "Pat Fish," at least in the Relativity band bit), and guitar-plucker/singer Max. "Oh, he's got himself into an office job somewhere," was the Butcher's reply when the inevitable Max questions came from the audience.
	<p />
	The Butcher has rebounded with an all new band, and this all new album, titled Fishcoteque (Creativity). The new band is more raw, and the chemistry's different. The Butcher is more clearly the frontman now. The sometimes jazz flavored doodlings of Max's guitar have been replaced with a more driving jangle. Vocal harmonies are less delicate (and accurate), but louder.
	<p />
	The band played material off the older records and some of the new stuff, including the inevitable dabble in white boy hip hop. Have you noticed that few British bands can resist giving pseudo rapping a try? (See Style Council, Housemartins, Woodentops. The list goes on.) When will they learn that taped samples and rapid-fire words do not a def jam make (especially in the Butcher's case with his posh accent).
	<p />
	But enough about the music! The reason for going to a club is to be entertained, and the Jazz Butcher always seems to deliver. Butch can't play that well, or sing, or even write songs, but he is fun to experience—weird tall guy, all hunched over strumming like mad.
	<p />
	The best part of the show is always the Butcher's witty banter with audience. When someone yelled that the whole band looked anemic, the Butcher replied, "Of course, we're from the UK." After botching up the set list and introducing the wrong song, Butch smiled and said, "You can get away with kind of thing in Italy. You say whatever you way and they just smile and applaud."
	<p />
	By the end of the set, the crowd was dancing and sweaty. The band ripped through an encore of Camper Van's "Take the Skinheads Bowling" with a sort of pub rock-like fury. Nothing was really mind blowing, but all in the show was entertaining.

	The Jazz Butcher returns
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1992/May27.html">to the Commodore tonight</a> for an
	evening of whatever color has invaded Path Fish's soul.
	Lately, he indicates, it's a moody kind of blue.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"It's a pretty dark show," Fish says. "Some people aren't
	used to that. They think of us as a comedy act: Let's go and

	see us that way but..."

	Phoning from Saskatoon, Fish doesn't sound like a troubled
	man. In fact, as he happily remarks on the rubbish bins,
	called Orbits, that break up the endless ribbons of Manitoba
	highway, the leader of the Jazz Butcher sounds like the guy
	who once said that anyone who can stand on stage for 90
	minutes without cracking a joke is psychotic.
	<p />
	Yet the new album is called ${blue} and arrives after a low
	period which Fish describes himself as crazy as a loon.
	<p />
	And, for every irreverent and charmingly clever rocker
	(such as ${shirl}, with its key lyric, "I've had a thing about
	Shirley Maclaine since I was so high"), there is the obverse
	- ${shirl} on ${blue} or ${sis} on the previous ${cult}.
	<p />
	This - the introspective side that is wet with electric guitar
	- is the one that this edition of the Jazz Butcher has chosen
	to explore.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"Boy, have we got a mad version of ${sis} live," he
	boasts. "On the records it's pretty slow, but we thought,
	how can we do more with it? The first thing we did was
	make it even slower, which made it twice as long right
	away. Then we added a new bit, plus we have a monster
	guitar player and we let him go. So now the song is four
	times as long, but are we happy?
	<p />
	"Unh-unh," Pat says gleefully.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	The Jazz Butcher conspiracy was hatched in the mid '80s to
	put a jolly spin on the mope-rock of The Smiths, or a
	Hawaiian belch shirt on the black uniform of such gothic
	animals as Sisters of Mercy.
	<p />
	Pat Fish established himself as an engaging... character...
	rather like Ray Davies of the Kinks
	but with a particular fondness for the epic, rhythm-driven
	stories of the ${vu}. Jazz Butcher records tended to be as
	much examples of fan worship on Fish's part as they were
	documents of his own credos and confrontations.
	<p />
	With ${cult} and especially ${blue}, the band has come into
	its own. These are the best-produced of JB's records.
	Whereas ${cult} is fragmented and retains some of the
	self-indulgences of old, ${blue} has a cohesive sound and,
	Fish figures, was the first to capture the real personality of
	the band.
	<p />
	Given its history and Fish's love of rock'n'roll, it's no
	wonder that the band has become the eminence grise of
	${creat}, original home to House Of Love, The
	Jesus And Mary Chain and many shoe-gazing acts since
	Fish met owner Alan McGee in 1984.
	<p />
	And given ${creat}'s enormous influence on U.K.
	independent rock, it's no wonder that Fish has some
	misgivings about the direction the label has taken. So to a
	certain extent, he guides its conscience.

	${dist} is the title of the Jazz Butcher's 1986 album, but that
	name can also lend itself to the men behind the band quite
	literally. A select few around Bloomington seem to
	recognize the name Jazz Butcher, and it is a shame they are
	not as exposed as they should be. Or perhaps their lack of
	over-popularity is what saves them the vanity or "star"
	egos. They truly are the kindest, warmest British gentlemen
	one could ever meet.
	<p />
	A few weeks ago, on April 28th to be exact, I left
	Bloomington in a frenzy. It was a desperate last minute
	decision to struggle away from becoming a "Slacker" and
	remaining in Bloomington all my life. In fleeing, I drove
	off to Philadelphia (where I hope to possibly establish new
	roots some day) and happened to notice that the Jazz
	Butcher Conspiracy (or JBC as they are also known), were
	playing at a local small Philly venue.
	<p />
	A good friend of mine named ${del} tours with the JBC
	doing some DAT recordings, so I went to the venue early to
	hunt him down. When I asked the doorman if David was
	there, he shrugged and said to just ask the band. And there
	they were - tuning their instruments and having a few beers
	as if they were a local band in their own town. So I met the
	band by just walking right up, introducing myself and
	asking for David. "David...," one of them said, "...ah yes,
	one of the quiet ones. No I haven't seen him yet, but my
	name is Pete," and he reached out his hand to shake mine.
	Pete proceeded to introduce me to the rest of the band, one
	by one - each giving me a smile and a handshake. I was in
	awe of them for the music all these years, but I was even
	more in awe of their immediate friendliness and
	consideration in making me feel welcome. As we awaited
	the show to start - Pete, David and I played pinball to pass
	the time. The JBC and their whole crew of sound men,
	managers, and groupies are the warmest most incredibly
	entertaining British gentlefolk I have ever met.
	<p />
	The band's basis is ${pat}, or "the Jazz Butcher" himself, who
	began recording under that name in 1983 with the album
	${bacon}. Along the way in his musical career, Mr. Fish has
	played with such people as ${dj} and ${hask} (both from the
	groups ${haus} and ${rocket}, and incidentally brothers). The
	brothers were part of the JBC in 1984-1985, and later Pat
	Fish appeared on ${dj}'s solo album in 1990. ${max} was the
	incredible guitarist with Mr. Fish up until ${dist}
	was released. Mr. Fish also played with the
	guitarist Richard Formby on the 1990 tour. Formby now
	works with ${space}, another band Pat Fish works with now
	and then, as well as the groups ${perfect} and ${aero}.
	<p />
	The current JBC lineup which has been touring these United
	States since April 24th, consists of ${pete} on guitar,
	${nick} on drums, a man who Goes by the name ${dooj}
	on bass, and Pat Fish on guitar and lead vocals. ${pete}
	recorded on the JBC's latest release ${blue}, and has known
	Mr. Fish for about nine months. Pete is the quiet one, who
	seems to remain rather still and pensive in concert, taking
	every chord very seriously it seems. When I asked him how
	he like playing with Pat Fish and the whole JBC, he replied
	It's fucking great, I just wish I knew of work after June 18th
	when the tour ends." And he added rather lightly,
	"...suppose you can find me a job in the States, ya know -
	anything even under the table or something?" But I tried to
	explain our lousy economy as it exists and that I would try
	my best, but could not promise anything.
	<p />
	${nick} had a great story to tell of how he hooked up
	with Mr. Fish. "It's quite lucky actually, I moved to London
	in a flat below this chap who knew Pat from his home town
	in North Hampton. Pat was looking for a drummer at the
	time, and suddenly within a few days I got this phone call...
	It was amazing really." I asked Nick if he was enjoying the
	tour and he replied, "It's incredible, I've never done this
	before, ya know. It's like you meet so many great people,
	play and drink beer. It's amazing." Nick has played with Pat
	for about two months now, but says rather distressed "I
	don't know what happens next after the tour really. I mean,
	it might just be back to the dole for me and Pete." The droll
	meaning Britian's equivalent to unemployment checks.
	<p />
	${dooj} is the elusive one. Not only did I get few photos of
	him, but few words as well. He comes across as a bit like
	Johnny Rotten of the Sex
	Pistols, with his bleached white hair standing straight up,
	and his (I hate to use this cliche label) punk attire; but it
	should be made clear he is nothing like Mr. Rotten if you
	talk to him. He just stands out a bit against Pat Fish's
	hound's tooth suit - well trousers and a jacket, with some
	sort of paisley shirt. ${dooj} won't reveal his true name, and
	has played with Pat for about six months now.
	<p />
	I met up again with the JBC in Chicago, at their Lounge Ax
	venue on May 16th. They seemed to fancy Chicago quite
	well, above most other cities they have played. In Chicago, I
	was able to meet with other JBC "conspirators" - their
	sound man Iain O'Higgins, and former sound-man ${rev}
	produced the JBC release ${cult}.
	<p />
	Upon showing the band my photos from the Philly show,
	Iain exclaimed he had some photos to show me. "Oh no..."
	everyone else moaned, "don't get him started on this again!"
	Iain fumbled around in his briefcase to produce three
	packages of photos of his new baby daughter. "Look at this
	one!" he cheered, handing me nude bathing shots of the
	infant, and passing photos of soiled diapers and feedings, et
	al. I just laughed to myself at what real people these guys
	were. I mean, here is this thirtysomething British man,
	working with a well established band - giggling over
	pictures of his daughter and sharing them with people he
	just met. Of course then I had to compete and show off my
	new nephew, whom Iain praised in return. These guys are
	incredible, really kind, warm, fun men whose job is simply
	making music.
	<p />
	Pat Fish says "It's just a job really, ya know." I noticed some
	of the Chicago crowd was taken aback by Mr. Fish's
	musical attitude. He began the set explaining "All right I
	just want to let you know now, we don't respond very well
	when you shout at us when we are facing you this way,"
	(that is on stage). He continued, "It's not like in one ear out
	the other - shout for more, ya know? I hope you can feel the
	music here, (pointing to his mind) and here (pointing to his
	heart) and perhaps if you're lucky feeling it a little bit lower
	if you know what I mean," (alluding I would assume to the
	area between one's legs). Mr. Fish's attitude towards his
	music was quite amazing to me. He really seems attached to
	every word and chord as if each one held a very deep
	memory or wish he wanted to share.
	<p />
	Later in the show, a drunk man in the crowd yelled "play
	${shame} man!" and Mr. Fish replied off to the side
	something to the effect of "Sorry...don't believe I can put
	that one together anymore. It was so long ago and with a
	different band." The drunk man persisted, "yeah well if you
	cannot even remember your own song you might as well
	just get out of here!" Wherein Mr. Fish replied, "You keep
	talking like that and you will be out of here and rather
	quickly yourself." Mr. Fish then came to the microphone to
	say, "You know it's amazing how some people believe they
	are the only ones who has bought a ticket or something."
	Most of the crowd seemed to nod knowing what he meant,
	but a few shouted out "arrogant asshole!" or other rude and
	unnecessary comments. But I seemed to understand what Pat
	was saying. The music is as much (if not more) for them as
	it is for the crowd. "Look I don't tell you how to do your
	job, ya know?" Pat says rather pleadingly into the
	microphone. "The only ones who can argue with me on
	what to play is the band here," and he smiles to the others on
	stage.
	<p />
	It seems to take a certain kind of person to appreciate the
	Jazz Butcher's music, as well as their over-all attitudes.
	They do not want to sign autographs, they want to talk to
	people. As Nick put it, "yeah it's great, there really are no
	egos or pretension. When you come right down to it, its a
	job. A job we happen to enjoy doing."
	<p />
	Basically, the Jazz Butcher is composed of a bunch of
	distressed gentlefolk. Distressed by the economy, and
	feeling they haven't a really steady job - just like everybody
	else. And also distressed for being misunderstood, or
	misinterpreted as an image they are not. Mr. Fish seems to
	welcome people to just walk right up to him as he lounges
	around the venue before each show. Buy him a drink and
	just talk to him! I would encourage everyone to do so. Look
	for their shows, go early and introduce yourself, you won't
	be disappointed. They all are the funniest, warmest and
	most realistic people you will ever want to meet. I would
	just like to thank them for all the stories, the hugs, for
	watching the sunrise, and for some of the best times in my
	life. It's a great memory.

	${pat}, better known as British thinking-person's popster
	The Jazz Butcher, is on a personal mission to bring literacy
	back to pop music.
	<p />
	Over an uneasy nine-year, seven-album alliance with a
	sales-driven music industry, Fish has never taken the easy
	way out with a lyric. ${blue} was inspired by a nervous
	breakdown Fish experienced towards the end of 1990. The

	${yo} and ${shirl} erupt in frenzied bursts of
	driving guitar and feedback. Other numbers like ${rachel}
	and ${still} have a slow, glacial, beautiful, gothic
	sound. The highlight in this department is ${harlan}, Fish's
	gorgeous tribute to science fiction writer Harlan Elison.
	Over it all, The Jazz Butcher intones deep, resonant
	melodies, seemingly in calm control but always bordering
	the precipice that gapes just below the surface.

	The Jazz Butcher seems to belong to another distant era,
	where we discover with delight a certain homemade pop
	after years of New Wave deceptions. Cornerstone of a
	generation which is going to give colour and body to
	guitars, rediscover the idea of song writing, by distilling a
	gentle madness which remains his own, ${pat}, for these
	reasons will be eternally thanked.
	<p />
	But it must be said that the old chap has decline in the last
	years, releasing average records followed by others even
	weaker, to end up only existing through a handful of
	faithful. The others, those who have quit the scene since
	${fishco}, will perhaps this time come back into the fold -
	by nostalgia or amusement - it doesn't matter - and
	shouldn't regret the move.
	<p />
	Yes, Waiting for the love bus is a good album. Not a work
	of art where we surprise ourselves on each listen, but a good
	album none the less. Having passed the obligatory
	de-greasing, 2 or 3 tracks get the album off the ground - a
	good old family boogie like in the damp basements of Le
	Havre or Boston and after we have done the ${vu} 70 -
	OK??, the rest is of high quality.
	<p />
	In fact 4 songs, in the middle of the record, but 4 which we
	are going to wear out, with ${whad}, beautiful and sad which
	it's bits of organ gathered by light sweeps of a tempo which
	seems like a muffled whisper. Followed by ${sweet} and
	${ghost}, much more up beat, where the perfect choruses
	will give the Butcher the certains Mini Hits which have
	deserted him lately. ${baltic} tops off this little series and
	imposes itself like a driven in nail to show this return to
	form, with its Baroque waltz melody where even the guitars
	end up sounding like a harpsicord. After this the purring can
	continue and finish in comfortable indifference, these fours
	songs will have been enough satisfy you.

	From the start, waiting for the love bus mires itself in a steamy
	bog of uninspired rhythms and dreamy, sleepy mid-80's pop
	drivel - albeit with less predictable lyrics. Pretentiously boring
	throughout, the 68-minute, 15-song disc never manages to free
	itself from the gooey muck underfoot.
	<p />
	Even were it not as muddy as the Mississippi, the entire collection
	of spacey compositions has about the same effect as a warm glass
	of milk or a death in the family. ${baltic}, the one track capable of
	transcending the album and taking flight, suffers the same plight
	as the rest of the waiting. With a better mix and more emotion,
	capable vocalist, this song coulda happened. But it doesn't.
	<p />
	Lacking almost completely from waiting, The Jazz Butcher's 16th
	release, is the diversity they have been widely applauded for in the
	past. Unless you consider that ${davis}, the album's opener, bears a
	slight resemblance to very early Pink Floyd (Emily's Bicycle-era
	Floyd, before most of recorded history), and that ${kill} is
	reminiscent of a basic Stones rocker (though without the solid,
	driving backbeat and the insistency of Mick Jagger's vocal
	ravings), you'd have to say it all sounds pretty much the same.
	<p />
	As a special treat (oh, please!), The Jazz Butcher closes the album
	with rousing covers of Everybody's Talking and Do You Wanna
	Dance? But don't worry - you'll be asleep by then.

	It's only fitting that an interview with a band that started for all
	intents and purposes by accident was also initiated by weird
	circumstances. Technical and scheduling difficulties lead me to have
	the following conversation with ${pat}, The Jazz Butcher, but the
	initial inspiration as well as the base set of questions came from
	fellow TSE writer Dennis Sweeney.
	<p />
	However, it's not as if I haven't been familiar with and, more
	importantly, fond of The Jazz Butcher before any idea of this
	interview blossomed as it did. I really dig what they've done. I've
	been taken in for the whole ride, from the early wackiness of ${nons}
	to the floating-like feel on ${bus}. The `Jazz Butcher' imprint, if you
	will, has come to symbolize quality for me and if you trust my era and
	music sense, please pay attention to the following.
	<p />
	But how about some history first? The Conspiracy was started in
	Northampton in 1983 by Pat Fish, an Oxford philosophy graduate, and
	it's been in his charge since, making a total of nine studio records and
	a couple of live recordings as well. And though throughout the globe
	you'll find their material licensed to various labels (in America it's
	been Big Time, Relativity, Sky, and now Tristar Music, among others)
	they've really only been signed to two labels: at first Glass Records
	(1983 to 1986) and then ${creat} (1988 to present), both
	based in their home country of England. [Those of you interested in
	the Glass recordings can anticipate their re-release here in the
	States in the coming months by Fire/Restless Records.]
	<p />
	Fish has always had a fluid line-up of members, mostly using his
	friends who shared a similar enthusiasm for music making, like
	various members of ${rocket}, ${aero}, and ${space}. For more details
	on all of this, please read on.

	<div class="iview_q">
	TSE- ${bus} is your first record billed as "The Jazz Butcher
	Conspiracy" since `86's ${dist}. What motivated you to bring back
	the "Conspiracy" to the band's title and what, if anything does it
	signify?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Pat Fish- We could have easily called it "The Jazz Butcher
	Group" of "The Jazz Butcher And His Mates" or a hundred things,
	you know? But "group" and "band" and all those words, who is
	that? That's the four guys you see on the stage, isn't it? When ever
	you see us live, there are probably about seven people at least
	actually out there working [road crew, too] and there are more
	people shut in offices organizing and so forth, so it's
	["Conspiracy"] just a bit more honest than "band". When we tour,
	we do get a stable line-up, but most of the time there are loads of
	people who can say they're in the group. It just encompasses our
	very loose way of working. Why it's come back at this point is
	that the new record was made by a band that was a touring band,
	and given that we thought of ourselves that way - we felt
	particularly `bandy' - we made that the name of the group. But
	there's no great particular reason; ${cult} could have been a
	"Conspiracy" album. That was a touring band making a record,
	but sometimes they're not. ${blue}, that was me an a bunch of pals
	- off of "Conspiracy" if you like - but it was basically a Pat solo
	album.

	name been for you?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Huge amounts of trouble! It began way, way, way, way back,
	when I started making the tapes alone at home on a cassette player.
	One of the first things was called ${zombie}, which was basically
	about the joys of intimate relationships with those long dead.
	Well, you know, I wasn't about to put my name on this. [He
	laughs.] They were just silly little tapes, but I did send them out to
	four friends, one of whom said, "Ooo, I'm starting a label; why
	don't we make a record?" Well, you know? Does the Pope shit in
	the woods? All young men want to make records, so I said, "Yeah
	sure." And it comes out as a "Jazz Butcher" record. It was never
	meant to be a public name. It was kind of a laugh on the tape, you
	know? Yes, it's caused rakes of confusion, but the simple answer I
	normally give when people ask about it is, "We don't play jazz
	and we don't eat meat." [We laugh.] If I had known when I made
	that first album... I had no idea that I'd ever do gigs or anything,
	you know? I just thought I'd make this silly little album, we'll sell
	a 1000 copies or so and maybe next year when I get my holiday
	from work, I can make another one. Some young folks like to go
	to Spain for their holidays. Well, me, I thought it would be nice to
	go to a recording studio. But I never really thought much of it
	other than that I thought "The Jazz Butcher" was good because it's
	anonymous, a crack in the margins. It never occurred to me that
	there would be six week tours of foreign countries where people
	would be coming and see your face going, "You're The Jazz
	Butcher!" I was taken by surprise by it. When I moved from my
	first label, Glass, to ${creat} in '87, I said to Alan McGee, "Look,
	why don't we change the name now?" He was like, "You can't do
	that, Pat. You can't. All those people in America won't know who
	you are; they know who The Jazz Butcher is." So he sort of beat
	me back into doing it. And here I still am, but these days I'm
	feeling very, very restricted by the name. People have come to
	expect a certain way of doing things.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	But your music, especially on your earlier records, is very
	eclectic, so how has it become limited?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's more a question of the presentation of the live format.
	People think, "Oh, `Jazz Butcher', yeah that's that punk rock
	group with two guitars, drum kit and a bass" and sometimes you'd
	like to do something different, you know? We've been doing a
	few acoustic gigs around here. Not the sort of unplugged thing,
	but just smaller scale to enable you to play in a smaller room if
	you get the chance. It's very, very free! And in a way it's more
	rockin' than the whole band, because you don't have all the
	arrangements and complicated drums... I mean look at ${richman}.
	He can go out, just a bloke, and he can take his guitar off and he
	can sing and still 200 people will think it's great. If he was still
	called "The Modern Lovers" he'd have a problem doing that.
	Although "The Jazz Butcher" is quite clearly a singular name, I
	think people associate it with a full rock band, which is great. I
	love rockin', but there are other things you can do as well. I just
	feel constrained by that, but I'm just talking about the live show; I
	feel I can do what I like in the studio.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	But isn't it just a matter of dictating to the public what
	you're going to present? If you say, "The Jazz Butcher live can be
	almost anything" then they'll come to expect that. Wouldn't they?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	They will in an ideal world, where promoters care as much
	about what they're putting on as the people who are playing it.
	But in a way, you know, you can't blame these guys. You get
	some guy in Phoenix, Arizona or in some small town in Spain and
	an agent phones him and says, "Hey, do you want The Jazz
	Butcher? They're coming your way. They got a night off; they'll
	play your club cheap." And they'll go, "Oh, The Jazz Butcher,
	that's that band from England. Ain't they?" And the agent who
	knows you just goes, "Yeah, that's right." And so it spreads.
	People can be lazy. We did gigs in France a few years ago -
	${green}, the sax player, and myself - as a duo. And though it had
	`acoustic' or `solo performance' or something like that written on
	the posters we gave them, a lot of promoters didn't pass on the
	message so a lot of people expected a band. But even when it was
	written on the posters, they were going, "So, where are the
	drums?" You'd be surprised how conservative a rock audience can
	be. The larger number of people you get in the same place the
	greater the overall intelligence goes DOWN. [I laugh.] Look at the
	Nuremburg riots, my friend - a lot of people, not very smart. A
	lot of rock audiences go, put their hands in the air, they clap at the
	beginning of songs because they recognize them. Well who are
	they clapping for? Themselves? It's just a big DUMB ritual.
	We're much more interested in trying to get through, to really
	talk to people, to really give them a blow to their heads and say
	"Listen to this shit! It's not just some wacky English guy doing a
	${hitch}. It's all real life. Listen to the music; we like it a lot!" You
	know? The fuckin' nerve to someone who's been on the road for
	ten years, but who's to blame for that? Sometimes, you'll find that
	if you do things, like sit down with an acoustic guitar and no drum
	kit, because people see that it looks different they may switch off
	the rock ritual and start to listen, than you get more rewards [as a
	performer.] Sometimes if you turn up on a stage - even if you're
	doing really good shit - if you got a drum kit and standing-up
	people with electric guitars. What's peoples frame of reference
	for that? They've seen The Who do that. They've seen Nirvana do
	that. You know... [sighs, with a laugh]... we ain't in competition
	with that kind of stuff. That ain't what we do. I like to be rockin',
	but I don't want to be ROCK.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	You had mentioned before that when you go on holiday,
	instead of like most people who go to Spain, you prefer going into
	a recording studio. What about music makes you want to do that?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	[Hesitating for a moment] It's a satisfaction similar to the
	kind you might get by playing squash or making love or driving a
	car very fast around a racetrack. It's the actual physical and mental
	act together of doing something and cooperating and moving of
	sounds.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	How did you find this out?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	I don't know. I can remember when I was six years old and
	hearing something on the radio, like Tom Jones or something, and
	realizing instinctively that this rhythm thing was going around
	and around - I could just feel it. I could remember even hearing...
	There was this kind of music that was very popular in the early
	`60's where you would have huge choirs singing pop songs with
	very little instrumentation. Someone who did this I think was the
	Mike [he struggles a second with the name] Sams Singers who
	sang "Would you like to riiiiiide/In my beautiful, my
	beautiful/Ba" - wait for it - "Looooon", you know? And when
	they hit that part, "Ba [pause] Loooon" I became aware that
	although I was six and wearing short pants, I was kind of
	squirming with embarrassment. So early on I realized that this
	shit could effect me in such a spinal manor. But I wouldn't call
	myself a `musician' because I haven't got the fingers or the skills
	and probably not even the sensitivity to do it properly, but I
	noticed that it effects me and I'm constantly messing with it to see
	what I can do. I have surrounded myself with very good musicians
	which is how I can get away with it, I guess. [We laugh.]
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	Now how did you fall into that group?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Lord [he sighs in confusion] I don't know. The band as it
	started, when it became a band after a year of making records and
	gigs were coming, we were just a bunch of friends. We literally
	found Jones, the original drummer, in the guitar player's flat one
	day. We just fell together, but broke up because after two years we
	realized we made no ground rules and had no idea about what we
	were doing - we went from playing a pub in Northampton to
	playing The Roxy Theatre in Hollywood and our friendships
	were getting strained; two years of free spirits for guys who
	weren't able to afford it before and you can't help but get a bit
	weird. The next band that got together was totally different. We
	found the bass player through an advert and the rest were people
	who had been out with the first group as guests, but I really didn't
	know them. So we laid down the ground rules, which was a really
	great laugh. It's one thing you don't think about when you have a
	new band and go on tour but one of the great pleasures is all
	sitting around in a bar one night getting off your face and writing
	The Law. We did it. Like a little fuckin' political meeting, but it
	helped the following two, two and a half years. But now as we're
	assembling a band, it's like after five years of being on the road,
	meeting people and other bands, we're at the stage of just choosing
	from a whole lot of people. A lot of people in bands, I know them
	as friends because I like their bands. I was constantly going to
	their gigs. And several years ago, it was quite possible that they
	knew me because of my records and they weren't making records
	yet, but they may now be making records and are even more world
	famous than me. [He laughs.] Which is really quite cool, actually.
	That has happened. Like the ${space} kind of alliance. I got their
	record deal with Glass initially and like, they only had about eight
	fans, you know what I mean? There was me, another bloke who
	ended up in the band and is now in Spiritualized... Hundreds and
	thousands of people know more about ${space}, Spectrum and
	Spiritualized than of The Jazz Butcher, but I'm still going to play
	on Spectrum records, you know what I mean? It is like with
	${aero} - they were this indie band that played toilets, that I
	thought were great and we hung out. I didn't have any influence
	on their career - they did it all themselves with their own talent -
	but like at one time you know them and they're that little band
	from Bristol and the next time you see them it's like, my mates,
	the pop stars from Bristol. You make your special friends and
	maybe they like your records and say, "Can I come and play on
	it?" ${lix} who's been in ${aero} for years and is in Strangelove
	now, he would like badger us. We'd go into the studio and we
	would have guitar players there but he'd phone us going "Come
	on, come on!" And it's like, "Of course mate. You'd be an
	ornament to our recording." We try to run it a little bit like a
	gentlemen's club, I suppose, but ladies can join too. We have
	ladies on some records and we have a lady manager.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	You already touched upon this, but let me formally ask this
	question the way it was given to me. It seems for a while The Jazz
	Butcher gained a reputation as the world's greatest purveyor of
	modern drinking songs. [Pat snickers.] And some feel that the old
	Jazz Butcher was one of the great party bands of all times. Do you
	still like to down your share of pints?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	That's a fair question, but I think people in America are
	more interested about that because there are more taboo SHIT
	regarding drink. In a country like Spain, or somewhere like that,
	the kids will be with the parents at ten o'clock at night at the
	dinner table drinking wine, you know? It doesn't matter when you
	have that first horrible night with drink and it doesn't matter what
	age you are. The first time that you drink too much and really
	fuck up, you can be fifteen or thirty, it really doesn't matter,
	because you're still going to make a big fool of yourself whatever
	age of experience you've got. I'd say let them get it out of the way
	when they're young. Drinking can be a severe problem to people.
	It's been a fair old problem to members of our band at times - me
	included - but nothing life threatening, or even brain threatening,
	but quite bad enough, thanks. But I personally love beer. I am
	about beer the way some people are about wine. I'm a right
	fuckin' weirdo about it. It's like angels dancing on your tongue,
	my friend. [We laugh.] So, yeah, we used to like to drink and we
	still do, but I think a lot of that was blown out of proportion. Not
	many rock and roll bands do write songs about it, but when I
	stared writing those types of songs, I did a huge burst in a row.
	Drinking is a part of life. A lot of your social events, in this
	country, anyway, happen in bars; you see bands in bars, you meet
	people in bars, and you even do interviews in bars. Most classical
	musicians did a couple of drinking songs. Most jazz vocalists
	would have a couple of drinking songs and a couple of druggin'
	songs as well. So I don't see any reason not to, but I think the only
	reason we get a rep for it, is the fact that most groups are too far
	up their asses or too far into their own image to even contemplate
	singing about something as everyday as that. We DO sing about
	the everyday! Although I respect ${hitch} for what he does, I really
	resent comparisons with him because he uses his imagination a
	lot. A lot of our stuff I can imagine Americans listening to and
	thinking, "Wow, wacky ol' Pat; what a wacky imagination. He
	must take loads of drugs!" And yet, whatever my intake, the actual
	subject matter is, in the region of 77%, pure reality. I may fuck
	with the grammar a little bit. I may put two points of view in the
	same three minute song. I may do a tune of tricks, but a record is
	going to last you what, a year, eighteen months before there is
	another chance? So I try and make the words... They don't have to
	reveal themselves on the first shot. They don't have to be, "Baby,
	baby, baby, going to fuck you all night." They might actually say
	the same thing but it's like, "hey, let's dig through it." They aren't
	word puzzles. They aren't word games. I'm just trying to write
	something that is worth listening to over and over and over again.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	And I think you've been quite successful.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, cheers. [He's distracted by his cat, meowing loudly
	in the room next to him.] But drinking, yeah, we do it and we sing
	about it very occasionally. However, I have learned to an extent
	not to do those tunes. I have found myself forced, certainly on my
	last American tour when I was not in a social mood anyway
	because I was having a lot of trouble in my life, the band was
	sounding great - I loved that band - but we literally were doing a
	lot of what we call the `art misery' numbers. And one could see
	the frat-pack guys who loved the drinking songs getting blown
	[pissed] off, but, then again, you can see other people down there
	with their eyes shut, just having some kind of, like, `experience'
	that they will not get at most rock bands' concerts and that's what
	we were selling to an extent. If we do drive away a couple of the
	guys screaming out, "Play ${devil}!", who cares? That was like the
	third song, the throwaway track on a twelve-inch single in 1985
	and, like all jokes, it's only funny a couple of times. [We laugh.] I
	think what I should do is write some new jokes, but the thing is
	with The Jazz Butcher getting ever more so like... I have to
	explain it to people with an American viewpoint, a Canadian
	viewpoint, a Japanese viewpoint, a German viewpoint and
	sometimes I have to explain them even in foreign languages.
	When they find out I can speak a bit of these tongues, it's a big
	deal and they put me on the radio. So I've gotten to think about
	this a lot and I guess I've gotten a bit cagey about lettin' people
	think we're a comedy act, you know? I have this whole bank of
	recordings of imaginary bands. Like lately I've been working on a
	<div id="blagdon" />
	project by an imaginary artist called `Mister Blagdon', [he starts
	laughing while continuing to speak] and he's been dead for a
	hundred years and all he plays on these tapes is a harmonium. No
	backing, no words, just the harmonium. And he plays things like
	the Alfred Hitchcock Theme and death marches and shit like that.
	I took about ten minutes to record each song. It's music for the
	dead by the dead. Yeah, I got a stupid sense of humor, but by
	doing projects like that I can keep it out of the way of interviews
	like this. [We laugh.] It's difficult enough to have to explain your
	more noble instincts, without having to start explaining jokes that
	you made up when you were drunk in 1985. So you see why it's
	sometimes necessary to blow them off so that they notice that I'm
	actually playing guitar as well. I'm really proud of the guitar
	playing on our records and it never gets talked about. It's the same
	with ${hitch}. His guitar playing is fabulous. When I heard tapes of
	The Egyptians, I thought there were two guitarists, but when I
	finally saw the band and there was only one AND he was singing
	at the same time! Whatever you think of the guy as a writer, and
	I'm kind of undecided about that, as a fuckin' guitar player he's
	great! And no one ever talks about that.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	Your first couple of records were filled with many forays
	into different styles of music, but your last two seemed more
	focused, limited to a particular sound. Had this been a conscious
	decision?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	I don't know. When we first began we didn't know much
	about it. We'd be running around the studio like, "Oooo, what's
	this for? What's this do?" And, basically no one told us [he
	snickers] that we only had to play one kind of music. If I wrote
	something that sounded a bit country, then being good musicians,
	they'd all get together and knock it out in a country style. Also,
	we didn't actually form for commercial motives. It was more by
	accident, so we felt free to fuck around with stuff. Later on, I
	think what happened is that I just spent more time in studios and
	learned how to use the studio. Of course, there are sounds on
	particularly likes. I guess ${cult}, ${cult} and this one all have a
	fairly consistent sort of sound of writing and a way the writing
	matches up with the sound and yeah I think I'm quite pleased
	about that as it shows I'm not just a fuckin' musical impressionist.

	So far this year Northampton's Jazz Butcher Conspiracy have
	played club dates in Germany, Switzerland, France, and Holland.
	They have appeared at a festival in a huge sports hall in an obscure
	part of Belgium, and done two very well received dates in London
	at The Garage and the Mean Fiddler. The line-up of the group
	has settled once again, so we can tell you that they are:
	<p />
	${pat} - Songwriter, singer and guitarist
	${hend} - Electric guitar and voice
	${dooj} - Bass guitar and voice
	${gab} - Percussion and voice
	<p />
	Over the next couple of weeks the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy will
	be undertaking a few acoustic dates in England. Pat and Dave will
	be appearing as a duo at Lincoln - The Barbican on Saturday 21st
	May and at Slurp's Wino Bar in Northampton on Wednesday
	25th May. The entire four-piece will then play an acoustic set at
	the ${creat} tenth anniversary "Undrugged" concert at
	<b>The Royal Albert Hall</b> in London on Saturday 4th June.
	<p />
	The JBC will revert to an electric line-up for a tour of European
	festivals starting at Clermont-Ferrand in France on Thursday 7th
	July, before undertaking their SIXTH North American tour at the
	end of the summer. ${bus}, the current ${creat} LP, has just been
	released in the USA where it is busily scrambling up the
	alternative charts and garnering the - dare we say? - usual rave
	reviews.
	<p />
	${pat} has been following a rigorous "no recording" policy for some
	months now, for reasons which he is unable to make clear. He has,
	however, recently appeared on the new ${aero} album (Beggars
	Banquet Records) and is currently helping ${sonic} to record
	the new Spectrum long-player for Silvertone Records.

	In ten years, the Jazz Butcher has undergone more transformations
	than most bands do in several lifetimes. Led by the Jazz Butcher
	(aka Butch; in truth, ${pat}) himself, it is, regardless of
	incarnation, his lyrical witticisms and humorous critiques around
	which the group's music revolves.
	<p />
	The debut LP, ${bacon}, is for all intents and purposes a one-man
	show. Butch plays a startling array of instruments, from guitar to
	xylophone, and employs a legion of session musicians to help
	create an album that encompasses an awesome variety of styles.
	Good ideas abound in songs like ${zombie}, ${engine} and ${flan};
	there's just some uncertainty as to where they're going.
	<p />
	${scandal}, the second album, was recorded by a stable quartet that
	included ex-${haus} bassist ${dj}. Almost exclusively in a folky
	pop-punk format, the songs are better developed and reach logical
	conclusions. Amoung the gems are a hysterical anti-macho
	anthem ${men} (`Some things never change / Notice how they
	never sit together on buses?') and ${smiff}.
	<p />
	${gift1} is a collection of single sides, an excellent package that
	affirms the band's folk-punk commitment. Of special note is the
	early up-tempo version of ${smiff} and the pop gospel ${rain}.
	<p />
	${sex} is the Jazz Butcher's crowning achievement. The eight
	near-perfect tracks run the gamut from funk to folk to
	country-western and punk. Butch's lyrics aim high; subject
	matter, more than anything else, defines the style of each song.
	${reagan} addresses the problems of America, Russia and nuclear
	arms with a healthy chunk of dance funk. ${holiday} uses a
	typewriter backing track and cabaret stylings to make light of the
	staid British persona; the frantic adrenaline punk of ${pets} tackles
	preconceptions about Russians (`Everyone says that they lift
	weights/Except for me I think they're great'). All of this, plus two
	great pop tunes: ${sat} and ${rumour}. (One CD joins ${sex} with
	${scandal})
	<p />
	With a new bassist replacing ${dj} (off to rejoin his old bandmates
	in ${rocket}), the rechristened Jazz Butcher and His Sikkorskis
	from Hell issued the live ${hamburg} LP and an EP, ${hard} which
	picks up where ${sex} left off, adding blues and merseybeat to the
	seemingly bottomless bag of musical tricks. ${nons} is an
	American collection that includes some of the above-mentioned
	tracks.
	<p />
	Leaving the rest of the band by the wayside, Butch and guitarist
	${max} then released a four-song 12-inch, ${conspir}. The best
	things on it are the title track, a clever play on rap music, and the
	hilarious homage, ${lorre}.
	<p />
	With Butch and Max as the nucleus, a newly formed Jazz Butcher
	Conspiracy recorded
	${dist}. A Jazz Butcher record by any other name, this album
	reveals the usual diversity -- folk (${kitch}), funk (${bigbad}),
	country-western (${fall}) and pop (${angels}, ${nada}) - as well as
	Butch's ever-incisive wit, which is in rare form on the track
	${domest}.
	<p />
	Shortly after ${dist}, Eider resigned his Butchership for a solo
	career. <b>Best Kisser in the World</b> is a beautifully romantic record
	consisting of soft rock ballads and jazzy torch songs. Max's vocals
	replicate Butch's almost exactly; only lyrical content provides a
	decisive difference. If the Jazz Butcher has a sane and serious alter
	ego, Max Eider is he.
	<p />
	In 1988, a two-person Jazz Butcher (Butch and ${kizzy})
	released the fifth proper LP,
	${fishco}, proving the Butcher to be as resilient as he is prolific.
	Reorganisation has had no effect whatsoever on Butch's abilities,
	and this record rivals ${sex} in its brilliance. ${next}, ${village} and
	${chick} are sterling.
	<p />
	${gift2} is an assortment of tracks (including ${groove}, ${becky}
	and ${olof}) drawn from previous releases by the Jazz Butcher,
	Sikkorskis from Hell, ${conspir} and the Jazz Butcher
	Conspiracy. Limited quantities of the original pressing contained
	a live 7-inch EP.
	<p />
	As Butch insists in his liner notes, ${spook} "is not an LP; it is a
	single and a radio session nailed together for your enjoyment". A
	smoky cover of the titular Classics IV hit and an extended version
	of ${fishco}'s silly chicken rap ${best} highlight the new stuff and
	the Montreal radio broadcast sounds quite all right.
	<p />
	${planet}, Butch had acquired a fairly steady group of sidemen,
	losing not a morsel of his keen wit or musical individuality. He
	even reveals a renewed vitriolic vigor in ${kid} (a hilarious tale of
	working-class juvenile delinquency) and ${plague} (a lethal dance
	craze). Sharply observant and masterfully executed, this is a
	record from a band that has well earned its reputation for
	eclecticism. Sheer entertainment.
	<p />
	${cult} opens with an instrumental that sounds like the Ventures
	performing at a Greek wedding. A Mediterranean refrain wafts
	through the rest of the LP, subtly linking the thirteen cuts into
	what is as close to a ``concept'' album as the Jazz butcher is likely
	to make. (What the concept might be, however, is anyone's guess.)
	Nevertheless, on ${onion} Butch manages to flawlessly replicate
	${cave}'s stripped-down gothic atmospherics. And faced with song
	titles like ${daycare} and ${bait} and a sweet lullaby called ${fert},
	one can only smile and enjoy. If the wild psychadelic raveup of
	${panic} is totally incongruous, it's also perfectly in synch with the
	rest of this wonderful collection.
	<p />
	${closet} is an unessential compilation containing ${spooky} and an
	assortment of album tracks from 1987-'90.

	Just what is this thing called the Jazz Butcher? For four
	years now this question has plagued many a listener. Is it
	one man's twisted solo persona, singing
	not-quite-your-average songs about <a
	href="${jbc_lyrics}/zombie_love.html>zombies</a>, <a
	href="${jbc_lyrics}/goldfish.html">goldfish</a> and <a
	href="${jbc_lyrics}/bigfoot.html">Bigfoot</a>?
	Is it actually a band, expanding its attack to include the
	Sikkorskis from Hell and <a
	href="${jbc_lyrics}/caroline_wheeler.html">dead fish in elevators?</a>
	Or maybe it's truly an evil elaborate plot to overthrow your
	mind with its first US <a href="${jbc_albums}/nonsense.html">album</a>&
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/index.html">tour</a> onslaught as the
	Jazz Butcher Conspiracy... Call it a man, a band or an
	insidious plan, call it neo-folk-jazz-pop-whatever or the
	best-sounding records to come out of Britain in recent
	memory, just don't call it late for dinner. We instead
	called lead singer and guitarist <a
	href="http://www.patfish.com">Pat</a> (a/k/a Butch) in L.A.
	recently at a reasonable hour and found him "<i>functioning</i>"
	during his first beer of the day, not to mention a most
	pleasant conversationalist.
	<p />
	In the world according to Pat, the Jazz Butcher is rather a
	loose aggregation trying to avoid this "<i>Jethro Tull school
	of pop music posturing</i>" as best it can, sometimes switching
	names, instruments and band members. Shortly after playing here,
	bassist ${felix} left his post in the band as ${dj}'s
	successor. Appended names continually change, such as the
	Jazz Butcher and the Sikkorskis from Hell
	<div class="iview_a">
	"They're
	Gothic heavy metal helicopters. We were completely twisted,
	doing one of our Hunter S. Thompson weekends, reading about this Sikkorski
	helicopter that crashed into the sea and thought of this
	heavy metal album cover, with teeth and flames -- we kept
	picturing this helicopter coming out of the mouth of
	hell...</i>"
	</div>
	the Jazz Butcher and the Kings of the Garage
	Scum from Hell, and the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy; and while
	the basic lineup - guitars, bass, drums - remains fairly
	constant, Pat is known to sub the occasional flute, bass or
	vocal saxophone bit. All rather befitting a project that
	evolved as a "<i>chance to go on vacation from day jobs and
	show all these bastards...</i>"
	<p />
	Living in Northampton, England, Pat was a "<i>middle-class
	college white boy</i>" who began writing in 1982 more as a
	hobby than anything else, just to see if it could be done.
	Glass Records released his solo album "${bacon}", in the UK that
	year; joined by ${max} on guitar, a partnership was formed
	that persists on every subsequent release. ${dj} (ex-${haus})
	also began working with them for the next few records before
	leaving for ${rocket}. Says Pat:
	<div class="iview_a">
	"He's a good friend of
	mine, and the other guys in ${rocket} are good friends of mine
	too, but I think he's completely wasting his time in that
	group. It seems to me to be completely about making
	money... he's capable of doing something worthwhile. I just
	hate these people who do pop music for money, or for the
	sake of their ego or to be loved or something - it's
	pathetic, what's the matter with these people? David's
	selling himself short by behaving like this kind of nitwits,
	by being in a group like that. On the other hand, I'm sure
	he really believes in it; I just think he's misguided."
	</div>
	<p />
	Was there ever any fear that the move to a four-piece band
	might change the original direction?
	<div class="iview_a">
	"One of my
	principles is that small is beautiful and stay away from the
	music business and all this sort of thing, and once you get
	a group there is a great danger that you're just doing this
	ghastly rock thing, but I think that Max and I are both very
	aware of that, that we can avoid it as best we can...
	There's a chemistry there which enables us to do more as a
	band."
	</div>
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher has yet to find a convenient niche in the
	UK music "scene": with a sound uniquely its own, the loopy
	charm and jazz-influenced guitar that distinguishes them
	from their contemporaries led to initial labeling as a
	novelty band. Pat agrees:
	<div class="iview_a">
	"That's what happens in the
	press because we ridicule their precious pop thing and point
	out that it's only part of capitalism. I think it kind of
	embarrasses them, and they don't know what to do 'coz we
	look one way and sound another, and so forth. They've
	finally realised that we're not going to go away, and we
	don't just write funny songs either."
	</div>
	<p />
	Nor does their current tag as a sort of "Lloyd Cole and the
	Smiths gone wrong" outfit describe the anomaly:
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I think
	that's basically because Lloyd Cole and I are the only two
	people with sensible haircuts in the entire industry. I
	quite like his music, but to suggest that we're influenced
	by him is ridiculous. We just have the same record
	collection, probably. And I quite like the Smiths - I like
	Morrisey, he's an individual; he can't sing, but he knows
	it. It's funny about the Smiths: when we began, everybody
	thought we were all ha-ha-ha, and the Smiths began and they
	went 'Poor miserable bastards'. But I notice that the
	Smiths are getting funnier and funnier, and we're getting
	more and more miserable, so maybe we're like passing each
	other and waving out the window..."
	</div>
	<p />
	While one would hardly call the new material "miserable,"
	there is a marked shift from earlier material such as ${jbpm}
	to some more introspective, brooding songs (the new
	${angels}), and a heightened political awareness and
	commentary.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I don't know that we've actually gotten
	more serious", concurs Pat, "but I can see the
	Butcher attitude being applied to more serious subjects,
	still identified with the way we see it, you know? One
	can't write songs about talking elephants all the time."
	</div>
	<p />
	But what of American audiences, newly introduced to the band
	through their first album in this country (${nons}, a
	compilation of UK album tracks and singles)? Their primary
	awareness of the band seems to be through just those kind of
	"lighter" songs about talking animals. Take, for example,
	LA radio's embracing of ${devil}. Doesn't this lead the
	casual listener to believe that's all J.B. is about?
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"If that song gives them 3 minutes of amusement and
	contentment, it's better than not having 3 minutes... In a
	way it could be frustrating, but there's no point pretending
	that's only a minor thing of what we do or dismissing it -
	it doesn't mean we're writing it to order; we don't think
	'Oh God, we've gotta have another funny song now'... A lot
	of the songs are there to ridicule what pop songs are all
	about. It's never been tailored to an audience. A lot of
	these songs that are just stupid, I just love 'em - you
	know, songs like 'Juanita Banana' by the Peels. Whatever
	happened to them? I mean, obviously one would get a certain
	amount of deep emotional satisfaction from hearing ${gf} or
	${angels} on the radio, but I started off doing this
	originally thinking that no one was gonna hear it at all.
	It;s just that as time goes by we discover that there are
	people out there that do like it. What they like is their
	business - if they like the stupid songs, I'm delighted to
	be of use to them."
	</div>
	<p />
	This leaves one wondering about the subject matter of some
	songs, such as the recurrence of hell and the devil in
	several of them. While the approach may be novel, some of
	it comes from personal experience, says Pat. Speaking of
	${devil}:
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I saw the devil, you know. It was really scary
	- he was enormous. He was the size of fucking Yorkshire,
	honestly, he was the size of Kansas. I mean, he was
	<b>really big</b>. I saw him on my lawn - I couldn't
	believe it. No, I hadn't been taking drugs, and I fucking
	saw him. I just knew he'd come for me, and I thought, 'What
	the fucking hell am I supposed to do?' I was scared; I gave
	it a couple moments' thought and I addressed him: I said
	'<b>Just fuck the fuck off, devil</b>', and he did! It was
	brilliant, it was the best thing that ever happened. I
	fucking hate the devil. ${devil} is just a piss-take on a
	stupid remark Roky Erickson (to whom the song is dedicated)
	made in an interview when he was out of his head, and I just
	thought it was too ridiculous to let pass and should be held
	up for public ridicule. I mean, I hate the devil, I don't
	wanna know him."
	</div>
	<p />
	Roky's comments notwithstanding, Pat remains a 13th Floor
	Elevators fan, belying an affinity for many American bands -
	a few of which to whom the Jazz Butcher has often been
	likened. Seems rather curious in light of the patently
	"<i>quiet sort of English operation</i>" that is the Jazz
	Butcher.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"It's weird, an awful lot of my favourite bands are
	American: Suicide, the Velvets of course, Talking Heads
	before they turned into a yuppie group. There's so many
	good American bands. For me, punk began in New York, no
	question at all. I mean, Patti Smith - <b>god</b>!"
	</div>
	<p />
	The ${vu} is a constants, and obvious, comparison, given
	the similarities in guitar style and cover material such as
	${jane} and <i>Waiting For the Man</i>, but ${richman}?
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	"He's not an influence. I like him, I cover his songs
	(${road}, ${affect}), we have things in common, but nothing he's
	ever done has changed the slightest idea in my mind. But
	he's brought me a lot of pleasure and I think we have a
	similar approach to things."
	</div>
	<p />
	What other bands also share their approach?
	<div class="iview_a">
	"The ${tops}
	go back a long way with us... they certainly have similar
	attitudes. Their song 'Do It Anyway' just about sums up the
	idea of their group and mine... (In attitude) we see
	ourselves as a punk rock group, musically too because we can
	do whatever we like. The trouble is, the people who call
	themselves punks now have been doing the same thing for 10
	years - they're more traditionalists than the bloody thing
	that punk came to blow away. Look at the Damned now -
	<b>look</b> at them! They look and sound like a heavy metal
	group... Kids who call themselves punks are just as
	reactionary as most people. But the punk attitude is
	all-important, especially in these days. We and a few other
	bands like the Pogues are keeping it alive - the ${tops}, the
	Mary Chain, the June Brides... I like rockabilly, I like
	psychobilly, I like every kind of music except heavy metal
	or U2. They're just putting their egos and aspirations over
	on a bunch of paying people, and I think that's
	stupid."
	</div>
	<p />
	How 'bout any of the bands the Jazz Butcher played with over
	here?
	<div class="iview_a">
	"${mildew} - flaming brilliant! Possibly the best
	band we've played with. Also, ${cvb}. We got
	on them and understood them very well. The tour's gone much
	better than we expected; we haven't had a bad night at
	all."
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_outro">
	That's certainly evident in the band's recent appearance
	here, where they played 2 completely different sets in one
	night to a <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Aug14.html">packed Roxy
	crowd</a>. The wait was worth it for the supposed "cult"
	following who'd waited long agonizing months before these
	shows, and new fans' eager response should encourage them
	back to these shores soon, possibly in March. (It should
	also indicate that there are quite a few people who don't
	mind having their minds overthrown.) Next step in the
	Conspiracy master plan: ${dist}, the just unleashed album.

	To call Pat Fish the best British songwriter of the past
	fifteen years is an invitation for some awfully suspicious stares.
	Pat who?  But he might be just that.  Known since the early 1980s
	as the Jazz Butcher, Fish remained detached enough to avoid the
	indie-rock vortex of the last decade, dooming himself to obscurity
	while leaving behind one of the most valuable buried treasures in
	all of alternative music.  
	<p />
	Fish has joined with an all-new cast to form Sumosonic.  In what
	may be a disappointment to long-time Jazz Butcher fans (they're
	out there), this inaugural disk is decidedly un-Butcheresque, with
	a keyboard-heavy attack of quasi-techno rhythms.  Pat was known
	to dabble in reverb and noise, but the results were moody, melancholy
	textures, quite unlike the flash of This is Sumo.
	<p />
	Never quite dance music, the tight compositions and good-natured
	feistiness are a bit too mischievous for outright club-fare.
	Consider the tongue-in- cheek ferocity of 'Monks of Kung Fu,'
	(which some might liken to the Butcher's 'Do the Bubonic Plague,')
	with its melodic grunting and hilarious Chinese sampling.  At times,
	like on the gentle 'Cat's Life,' it's reminiscent of New Order-style
	synth-pop, with dreamy, entrancing swirls set to a pulse- quickening
	backbeat.  The snappy chorus of 'Come Friendly Spacemen' will have
	you wearing out the repeat button, as will the balmy spells of
	'Stupid,' and 'Destroy All Monsters' which are at once energetic
	and disarmingly sweet.  The syrupy 'Sputnik,' meanwhile, is the
	prettiest thing we've heard since 1993's 'Whaddya?'  Fish is no
	less graceful with keyboards and effects than he was with acoustic
	guitar.  
	<p />
	Considering Pat's long and productive past, it's hard to judge This
	is Sumo as a true 'debut'.  But let's not get caught on Sumo-semantics.
	No matter his band-mates or current moniker, the man still has genius
	to share.

	Underground rock's greatest shame, and
	there have been a few, remains its neglect of Britain's Jazz
	Butcher, nee ${pat}, a remarkable songwriter who deserves a much better
	end than the bargain bin at Tower. To call Fish the best pop songwriter
	out of Britain in the past fifteen years is invitation for some awfully
	suspicious stares. But he might be just that. Now disbanded
	and involved with other projects, Fish and his Conspiracy remained
	aloof enough to avoid the alt-rock vortex of the last decade,
	thus dooming themselves to obscurity. But such a fate should
	diminish neither the brilliance nor the scope of their work.
	<p />
	At once quirky and sobering, from lounge
	music and drinking songs to feedback-laced explosions and textured
	ballads, the Butcher defied categorization ever since the quietly
	acclaimed and long-forgotten "${scandal}" surfaced
	all too briefly in the early 1980s. A batch of gems were to
	follow - "${dist}", "${fishco}",
	"${planet}" - a vast discography that continued without
	due praise well into the 1990s. In '92 came the last US tour
	and "${blue}," followed a year later by the ethereal,
	reverb-rich "${bus}". Our most recent treat, now
	two years old, was "${ill}", which like the others
	received minimal exposure on play-lists heavy with big-label
	attitude rock.
	<p />
	Now, Mr. Fish himself has taken the
	trouble to compile "${drainglass}", a brave retrospective
	culled from his five year span with the UK's Glass Records,
	a relationship that gave us five full-length albums in the
	early and mid '80s. Some of this stuff has never been available
	in the compact disc format, and/or is impossible to find, and
	it's something like religion to hear the brilliant capriciousness
	of '${smiff}' and '${betty}' in digital clarity (from the analog,
	of course) for the first time.
	<p />
	The Butcher's essence, at least in
	these showcased earlier days, is a punky, lighthearted recklessness
	kept in check by lush, cushiony underpinnings, of which dirty-pop
	classics '${gf}' and '${sat}' are irresistible examples. And
	that's ${dj}., the same of ${haus} and ${rocket} fame, playing
	and singing backup. Never one to take himself too seriously,
	titles like '${gold}' and '${count}' weave a deceptive whimsy
	through the work of a true master craftsman. <i>'Goldfish
	are silent'</i>, sings Pat, '<i>Under the water. But girls
	who keep goldfish...are sometimes quite loud.</i>' On '${foot},'
	Fish takes a jab at campy Americana. Like the Clash before
	him, he was often obsessed not with his native England, but
	with the colors and moods of America.
	<p />
	Don't be distracted by any lyrical
	lightheartedness. There's some mighty graceful musicianship
	under the superficial silliness - an acoustic irony wavering
	somewhere between beauty and hilarity, and often not afraid
	to commit fully either way. (To go off-disc for a moment,
	compare the inebriated fun of '${drink}' with the sad, sparkling
	power of '${good}.')
	<p />
	The Butcher can swing from all-out
	punk to a dewy ballad without so much as a smirk. Such versatility,
	without the self-indulgence we see so often, is maybe the true
	crux of his legacy.
	<p />
	For now, the Jazz Butcher sits on the
	verge of pop oblivion, much the way a band starring Reed, Cale,
	Morrison, and Tucker did so many years ago. And we all know
	what happened to them. Time will tell, but surely this disc
	is a step in the right direction.

	didn't.

	All these years, I've thought the Jazz Butcher
	(aka Pat Fish) had taken his moniker in a fit of dada. As this live set bears
	out, there's a bit more significance to it that the juxtaposition of the absurd.
	On a cold Hamburg evening about a year ago, the Jazz Butcher and a handful
	of co-conspirators took the stage and recorded a couple hours' worth of
	music. Overwhelmingly present are twin comping guitars, pumping and
	strumming out deliciously fractured chords and the occasional blue lick, and
	Butchie's old-fashioned melodic voice. The music is jazzy and unplugged, in the
	best sense of both words, while the songs themselves are more than a bit
	twisted in typical Jazz Butcher Conspiracy style. Familiar friends like
	"D.R.I.N.K.", "Partytime," and "The Human Jungle" are present here, the first
	two sticking close to the original plan and the latter stripped down a bit but still
	resplendent in its hooky melody. JBC fans must -- absolutely must -- seek
	this out. For the uninitiated, it's not much of an accurate picture of the band
	(other than in displaying just how top-notch JBC songs are), but it's still a
	wonderfully relaxed, stripped-down release and it does just fine on those

	song off our last book" and mean it? Only the wonderful Mekons.
	<P>This was in September in New York. I had the good fortune to be
	in town the same night the Mekons were passing through. I was one
	of many happy drunks in the audience, admiring my luck and loving
	the band, and I turned to share my shit-eating grin with the old
	friend I'd convinced to join me.
	<P>
	And I saw something impossible: she was bored.
	<P>Granted, the band wasn't playing terribly well. Actually, they
	kind of sucked that night. But even a bad Mekons show is worth
	seeing. You might get disgusted, you might be amazed, you might
	laugh uncontrollably. Boredom, however, is not supposed to be an
	option.
	<P>Two weeks later, back in San Francisco, a friend talked me into
	meeting him at the Great American Music Hall to see the Jazz
	Butcher. Like the Mekons, the Jazz Butcher was just playing for the
	hell of it; neither act has put out anything new recently. Like the
	Mekons, the Jazz Butcher has enough devoted fans to pack a
	good-size club nonetheless. In fact, the Jazz Butcher show was
	remarkably similar to the Mekons': a lot of back and forth between
	the audience and the band, a lot of songs about drinking, a lot of
	fans looking enraptured whenever an old song title was announced.
	Except this time, I was the one who got bored.
	<P>Well, not bored precisely. I just didn't get it. The show was
	good, I guess, but the audience response seemed out of proportion
	to what was actually happening onstage (which was basically two
	guys with electric guitars sitting on stools, playing catchy,
	clever songs, and chatting with the crowd in between). I eventually
	realized that, like my friend in New York, I simply couldn't see
	the show everyone else was watching.
	<P>There's a reason these types of groups are called cult bands.<B>
	</B>The term implies a status that can only be bestowed by the
	audience, fans who somehow surpass commonly accepted levels of
	devotion. The tricky part is, once fans attain that mystical level
	of attachment, the band ceases to be a cult band to them. From the
	outside, cults are insular and unfathomable. On the inside,
	however, there's a limitless universe of meaning, because cult
	members actually worship a lot more than just a band. The real show
	doesn't take place onstage; it exists in midair, at some point
	between the band and the crowd.
	<P>When you're a fan, you don't just hear the song that's being
	played, you remember the first time you ever heard it, the friend
	you put the song on a tape for, all the other times you've seen the
	band do it live -- who was there, how you felt, and what's
	different about it this time. Now, you can say that to some extent
	about practically any show, but you end up talking in a hopelessly
	abstract way. With cult bands, the phenomenon is distilled enough
	to be almost observable, because so many people in the audience
	share the same secret world of connections and memories. The result
	is either beautiful or depressing.
	<P>Beautiful because it leads to a temporary but genuine communal
	spirit that has always been one of rock and roll's utopian ideals,
	and that turns out to be sexier and a lot more boisterous in
	practice than it ever sounded in hippie theory. The Mekons weren't
	doing their songs justice, but the banter in between was hilarious,
	and before long they were spending more time talking than playing.
	<P>The show devolved into an extended conversation with the
	audience; whenever they did bother to play another song it was
	mostly so we would all have something else to talk about when they
	were done. At one point Sally Timms asked, "I've been
	wondering. Are any Mekons fans successful?" The ripple of awe,
	mirth, and embarrassment that swept through the crowd when we
	realized none of us were raising our hands was heady and
	complicated and unreproducible. For most of us, anyway.
	<P>And that's what makes cult shows depressing, too: the flip side
	of all that magical togetherness is an exclusive, self-referential
	insularity, the sense that you have to join some kind of club
	before you can enjoy the full experience. The fact is, I get a
	little tense whenever I recognize audience members from past Mekons
	gigs, because I don't really want to know what else we have in
	common. (I may, of course, just be a bastard. For all I know,
	everyone else at the Mercury Lounge that night had a pleasant
	dinner together before the show). And when my friend looked
	confused, instead of transported, I got another little hint of
	something darker binding the crowd.
	<P>Clearly, the Mekons are pretty important to me, and I may have
	been partly responsible for the befuddled look on my friend's face.
	I'd given the band a ludicrous build-up, explaining (in retrospect,
	I admit, this was probably goofy, but I was sincere at the time)
	they were the closest thing I had to a religion, and confessing
	that when I was a morose adolescent I once tried to make a list of
	reasons not to kill myself, and the only thing I could come up with
	was that I'd never get to hear the next Mekons record.
	<P>So you can understand why I might take anyone's failure to
	appreciate the Mekons' excellence as a personal affront. When
	you're that devoted to a group, you kind of need their talent to be
	undeniable. Otherwise, you know, there might just be something
	wrong with you.
	<P>I think that need, when it's shared by enough people, explains
	the bizarre dynamic between what I'm reluctantly calling cult bands
	and their followers, and that need also explains why the
	relationship was easier for me to see at the Jazz Butcher show,
	where I had nothing personal invested in the act. The shared
	devotion reinforces itself and makes up for the fact that the band
	never gets played<B> </B>on the radio. It's pretty exciting to love
	something unconditionally, and more exciting when the thing you
	love is a secret, of sorts. Yeah, there's power in 20,000 kids in
	an arena shouting out a chorus while the lead singer puts his hand
	to his ear, but it's also eerie and kind of false, and it's no
	match for 200 drunk adults in a club all shutting up whenever the
	band starts playing. The thing is, that equation only really works
	when every one of the 200 drunks loves the band precisely as much
	as everyone else.
	<P>At the Jazz Butcher show, I was person number 201. But I still
	had a good time, and I spent a happy hour outside the club
	afterwards, waiting for Mr. Pat Fish with my friend, who wanted to
	have the Jazz Butcher autograph his truck. To be honest, my buddy
	mostly wanted to do this to piss off his wife. Nonetheless, it's a
	perfect metaphor for the dual nature of cult devotion, a worship
	that's both imploring and imposing.

	<div class="iview_intro">
	The Jazz Butcher interests me strangely. He's quite tall,
	with a name inspired from a famous fishing painting. He
	therefore sings of goldfish. He wraps concern round
	lions, a young girl and her bedroom and generally
	quaffs the lager with gusto. He releases records like
	other people dream of holidays and crams so many
	styles and ideas onto one never-to-be-ash-tray that my
	head spins.  Not literally!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	How would he classify his music?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I always call it muck.

	Muck?
	</div>

	Muck. Sorry!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So how do people know if they can trust you, if they're
	not wimps? Can a man who describes his records as
	muck be all bad? That's what I'd say.
	And that's what he did say in the public house next door
	to ZigZag Acres, a place where the stars do roam. The
	Butcher is keen. Is integrity a major factor?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's all we've got. All it is, is one bloke wandering around
	and he'll see something and he'll think STUPID! He'll go
	away, play around with it and that'll be one record. There
	isn't a style, it's all different. I think there was one for a bit,
	The Big Soppy Pussycats. They've all gone and done
	other things, it was always a borrowed group. So now
	we'll do pop concerts and it'll just be me and Max. Two
	blokes. On stools.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Having spent a short term sentence in Oxford. Things
	were less than sparkling. The Butcher went to
	Northampton where, within the batting of an extremely
	slow eye lid, he was landed by Glass Records. Probably
	not surprising.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	There's a big sign on the door saying, 'Dave Barker
	owns this town'. Some people think it's a Northampton
	label because he's done The Tempest, ${dj} and
	he's got me and he puts on all these shows in
	Northampton with ${mitch}.
	<p />
	We're very lucky because the people that tend to work
	with us are always brilliant! Namechecks! We've got a
	bass player who's on 'Marnie' (the newest single) and
	'Smith' (an older one), called Rolo. He's got a group too
	called ${tops} who are good. Another guy in
	his band, brilliant drummer, called Paul Hookham. Then
	there's Joby (the crack shot behind In Embrace) ... these
	people! The other time we had a date where we'd
	committed ourselves to using bass and drums. Drummer
	we picked couldn't do it and we were doing it for him!
	I like musicians, people who can make good music
	without any effort, and we've got a history of bumping
	into people ... ${max} is ridiculous. Me, I can't play. I just
	fiddle with some things.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Give Butch a chance and it will be words he fiddles
	with. For a reason that has long since made a dash for

	kind of satan to modern womanhood, satan on your

	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I'd left my old group in Oxford and went I to live with
	my parents near Northampton, completely broke and
	they lived in the country. Nothing to do, nobody to
	play with so I had this tape recorder and a guitar and
	I started playing to see if I could play all the
	instruments and fake up a track. I played drums one
	day on the bath. If Test Dept turned up onstage with
	a bath, it'd be 'WAAAAHHHHH!'. We phoned people
	up, like the sax player and said, 'Look, we're making a

	the prole art threat would turn up on my doorstep but
	we got a letter from Mark Smith saying, 'We are STILLLL

	to know what it's about? It's basically an extended

	<div class="iview_a">
	Well to be honest I did only hear the one single she

<h3>CAUTION - This is a robotic translation of the original Québécois publication</h3>,
<h2>The Jazz Butcher: Under the fantasy sign</h2>

Bertrand HOULE Montreal (PC)

	<p />
Pat Fish, aka The Jazz Butcher
delights in fantasy.
Fantasy in the sense of a work of imagination
and a touch of madness.
What kind of music compose
that Jazz Butcher? Pop sometimes
abrasive, often eccentric (a trait
character that suits the British well) but nevertheless with finesse.
	<p />

	<p />
To get to know the character better, an overseas long distance
a telephone interview. But Fish
don't delay in diverting the call... as one diverts an oath.
	<p />

	<p />
Fish, who hosts a program in Great Britain
fortnightly television devoted to music,
is not infatuated with the game of questions and answers
	<p />

<div class="iview_a">
“Often, with a guest, I realize that we have nothing extraordinary to tell us and
that we are on the same wavelength. We then take the direction of the nearest pub. My
thing is more to make conversation.”
</div>

	<p />
Between two puffs drawn on his
cigarette and many jokes, he
so insisted on chatting about everything and
You're welcome. But he still spoke
some of his music

	<p />
First a brief history. Pat
Fish works under the name Jazz
Butcher for seven years. ‘Bloody
Nonsense', his first album distributed in Canada, was a compilation
of his three British LPs
published between 1983 and 1986. ‘Fishcotheque’, marketed last year, marked the arrival of a new group
of companions who have remained
res loyal to Fish for ‘Big Planet
Scarey Planet”, his recent opus.

	<p />
As usual, the music
of this LP is based on guitars but Fish has taken up sampling to enrich his sound palette.
	<p />
<div class="iview_outro">
The Jazz Butcher is back
for a North American tour of
35 gigs. As part of the Festival
new music from Montreal,
Pat Fish and his four musicians will be at Les Foufounes Electriques on Saturday November 11, then will go to
Ottawa for a show the following Monday at Barrymores

	<div class="iview_intro">
	It's several hours before showtime. Having finished
	the soundcheck, Pat Fish, The Jazz Butcher, submits himself to
	the same "big questions" he's been asked before.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Sometimes you see a Lou Reed
	interview, and he walks in and says 'You've got 20 minutes, and I
	won't talk about the Velvet Underground.' And some people say
	'Oh, what a dirtbox he is for talking like that', but in a way I
	think that's quite business-like. I mean I really don't think
	that's offensive. I mean, God KNOWS how many times he's had to
	talk about the Velvet Underground to people who don't even
	understand it, you know? So I kind of take his point, and I
	sometimes think 'Oh I wish I could do that'. When people ask me a
	certain question, I just think 'I wish I could just walk in a
	room and say I won't talk about this, that and the other. But, at
	the end of the day, he's Lou Reed and I'm me...and I don't even
	know what it is that annoys me until it has, you know?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> The Jazz Butcher's sound changes from
	album to album. For example, I can't see something off Distressed
	Gentlefolk going on the new album Big Planet, Scarey Planet.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> That's true. I think that's really just a
	question of time. Everyone comes to an album at the same moment,
	as it were. When you're in a band like the one that made this
	album or Gentlefolk, you've been together for a year or two. You
	start having pretty much shared experiences, and your concerns
	tend to be the same. We've always thought of our records as
	pretty much what we do at that moment. We sometimes use the
	analogy of a postcard. You go away for two weeks and you send
	back a little recording of it, saying this is what we were up to.
	Records for us are not really a thing to be carved in stone for
	all eternity.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> You toured rather extensively in support
	of the previous album, Fishcotheque. The song
	"Hysteria" off of the new album-a statement about the
	frustrations of touring?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> It's pretty much a diary of one week we had
	going down the west coast last summer. It was completely mad.
	Every line in that song is true. I really did sleep through an
	earthquake. Heaven is true. Heaven is a place between the
	Canadian and American border on the road from Vancouver to
	Seattle. If you ever drive that road, you'll know what I'm
	talking about. It's hard to express, but we were there.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Do you generally enjoy life on tour?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> We like to travel. Having discovered in 1985
	that one could travel off the backs of albums, it's always been a
	common desire running through members of the band.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> What about Alex (Green- Saxophone)?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Alex has got a thing. He never tours the
	States with us. He did a tour of the States with Dave J. once in
	about 1984, so it's nothing he's got against the country.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Kizzy's (O'Callaghan- Guitar) absence is
	due to illness, is that right?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> He's pretty seriously sick, yeah. He's
	finished his course of therapy. He'd already had his operations
	before he went away, but there was no way he was strong enough.
	He was being given radiation therapy, so his hair's falling out.
	His head's in a very good state. He's got his spirits 'round it.
	And he can still play guitar. One worries a lot, because when
	people have surgery in their heads, you hear horrible stories
	about things going awry and people not being able to do what they
	did right down to being able to talk. He can still clearly play
	guitar as well as ever. He had two operations, the first one they
	didn't get quite right. The second one went a whole lot better.
	Yeah, he should be okay.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Of your contemporaries, who are among
	your favorite artists?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> It's a funny old thing, I usually find that
	the bands who are making good records turn out to be my friends.
	And that makes me sit down and think, 'hang on, are you just
	being a bigot? Are you just out of touch, now?' But I think,
	no...I've actually gotten to like these guys by going to all
	their concerts and meeting them.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Such as?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Such as the Blue Aeroplanes, Who I gather
	were over here for the first time recently. I like Spacemen 3,
	who are good friends of mine. I used to see those guys when they
	were playing to eight people who hated them in a bar in Coventry.
	Ever heard of The Perfect Disaster? There's a third album out
	already in Britain called Up, which is one of the great third
	albums. I think that bands that makes a good third album is a
	serious band. First album- you make a good first album, yeah
	you're in there, but of course you've had 20 years to write it.
	And then there's the second album syndrome. By the time it gets
	to the third, it's like the classic media syndrome, the difficult
	third album. It pleases me that I've stuck by them all this time.
	Of course, in Britain that's an embarrassment for people, because
	I'm not supposed to be any good.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> The Jazz Butcher isn't appreciated in
	England?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, we just don't really have a media
	profile. Real people appreciate us. Real people come crawling out
	of the woodwork and come to the shows, and shout and dance, but
	not in the sort of numbers that happens in Germany or the U.S. or
	Spain or Canada.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> So where does the JBC find its most
	responsive audience?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> (Sighs) Everywhere we play except Britain.
	It's a tragic truth. We do best in German-speaking Central
	European countries. Also in, well, this whole continent really.
	I've been pleased with the turnouts on this tour.
	 Getting back, I've always listened to a lot of American music. I
	don't know how it is, I guess a lot of people in American towns
	probably look at London and think, 'Wow, what a swingin' scene,
	I'll bet all the bands live together, man.' I used to get that
	feeling when I was about 18, looking at New York and thinking
	about Television and the Walking Beds, Blondie and Dick Hell.
	I've always been a big fan of some mythical New York. I even went
	and married someone from there. It's embarrassing, my devotion to
	that city. I guess everyone looks to the grass being greener.
	Britain is very much enthralled to America in the media in
	general. If you want to have a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom,
	you've got to be selling records, and I mean literally, to
	children. I'm not talking patronizingly about 14 year-old what
	used to be called teeny-boppers, I'm talking about children. I'm
	talking about the single figure brigade. This is a problem for me
	because I have nothing to say to children. I don't like children.
	I'm 31, if I liked them I'd have some (laughs). With me, children
	are like dogs. They're all right on a one-to-one basis, but I
	wouldn't want one in the house.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> This seems an appropriate segue into
	discussing the song "Bicycle Kid".
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Ah, yes. Quite so.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Is there, in fact, an actual
	"Bicycle Kid"...?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Oh, yes. There are many bicycle kids,
	obviously. There's a tribe of them. There is a specific one who
	lives about half a block away from me. And one usually finds him
	in the street ranting and raving. He wears very few clothes and
	has these appallingly awful glasses and this terrible cropped
	haircut. I noticed to my complete and utter horror the other day-
	he's got like these Mike Tyson tennis ball cuts in the side of
	his hair now.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Do "Bicycle Kid's grow up to be
	"Real Men"?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Yeah, like I say, "Bicycle Kid- grow up
	and get an escort". I guess maybe people over here think
	'what does he mean? He goes out and uses prostitutes?' Escort is
	just this brand of car that "Real Men" drive, this
	really scaggy, black, cheap car that's done up to look smart.
	He'll get one.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Is he aware of the song in his honor?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I fucking hope not.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Let's talk a little bit about the
	previous album, Fishcotheque. I was interested to note that it
	was a departure from John Rivers as producer.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Yes, that was deliberate.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Why the departure, and why going back to
	him for the current album?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Good questions. The chief reason I departed
	from Rivers was that I found the production on Gentlefolk to be
	just too shiny. I wasn't crazy about that album. When Max (Eider,
	JBC guitarist until 1986) was gone, he went to Woodbine (Rivers'
	studio) and made his album there. And I heard it and thought,
	'That's good for you', but since the whole reason he'd gone was
	he was getting more into that shiny stuff and that sort of 'fake
	jazz'- I'm sure he wouldn't mind me calling it 'fake jazz'- And I
	was getting more into the stuff like what we do. I was kind of
	tired of people comparing us to Lloyd Cole. I wanted to show
	people, no...we're nasty. So basically, I went to as cheap a
	studio as possible. We turned everything up to 11 and went. It
	was supposed to be a sloppy album. Are you familiar with Bath of
	Bacon, the very first album? Well, "son of Bath of
	Bacon" was the idea. When it was proposed that it come out
	on CD, I was utterly horrified! I just thought, well...you're
	just going to hear people falling off of chairs and belching.
	It's funny, but when it came out, especially the Canadian press
	were saying, "Oh, he's gone all smooth," and stuff like
	this. "He's gone all, sort of 'middle-of-the-road',"
	and I was saying 'what?' You should've been there! It was a filthy
	racket. With this new one there was a certain element in my head
	of this as a second album. Rivers is good for second albums. We
	got in there, we knew he'd try to clean it up too much, so just
	turned everything up to 11, fed back, snarled about, and at the
	end of every song said, "Clean that up, baldy!"
	(Laughs) John is kind of like...every instrument is a lead
	instrument. Everything's got its own space with a nice little bit
	of reverb around it to make it clean and bright. Which I find, in
	a way, quite attractive. I'm not 100% on the album. It's too many
	lead instruments, and not enough rhythm. I mean, you've seen us
	live, and a lot of what we're about is this kind of double rhythm
	guitar helicopter hell, right? That perhaps doesn't come across
	quite as well as it might.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> In reading the liner notes on your
	albums, one gets the sense that you have a genuine appreciation
	for your fans.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I never knew there was going to be any!
	Honestly, this sounds so fake and crap, but when I set out to
	make Bath of Bacon, I was just making silly tapes at home, and I
	sent one to Dave Barker because I knew him and I thought it might
	amuse him. When he phoned up and said, 'Do you want to make an
	album?' I was just having dinner with my parents, I had no money
	at the time, I was living with my parents in the middle of
	nowhere. And I just thought, 'What? Are you kidding? Does the
	Pope shit in the woods? Here we go!' Having made the album, my
	only hope was that we'd just make enough money for him to let me
	do another one the next year. It never occurred to me that people
	would start buying it.
	 Sometimes people say, 'Why did the first band split up?' It was
	really because we were totally unprepared. We became a band
	because we'd made a record and a few people wanted to see us.
	Suddenly we were on tour for two years, and our lives got
	neglected...and everyone grows up a bit. We couldn't hold it
	together, basically. It would have been wrong.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> The original band being...?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Me, Max, Dave J, and (O.P.) Jones. Dave went
	off to do Love and Rockets, that was understood. We just fell
	together, we didn't know what we were doing. At least when I put
	together this new band at Christmas of '87, at least we knew what
	we were in for. Yes, I'm deeply grateful to people. If I'd kept
	on at my day job I would have gone abroad for one city for two
	weeks each year. I'd have seen nothing but the hotel. I'd have
	spoken to bar men and to people selling stamps for postcards.
	This, I mean...what a way to see the world! What an education.
	I'm deeply grateful to everybody.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Now David J (Bass), he had joined up
	post-Bauhaus, right?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Yeah, just about the time that "Ziggy
	Stardust" hit the top 10, they were doing some shows at
	Hammersmith Pallais, which is kind of a big venue. Now, I knew
	Kevin (Haskins-Drummer for Bauhaus and Love & Rockets) and we had
	a phone call when I was at work. I got home and Alice said, 'Pat,
	they want us to support Bauhaus at Hammersmith Pallais." I
	thought, 'FREAK OUT! GET A BAND!" So we rounded up a few
	people, we got Rolo (McGinty, guitarist-The Woodentops) and Alice
	and Max and me and this sax player we used to know. We went up
	there and they hated us, it was brilliant. There was 2,000 people
	going, "FUCK OFF! FUCK OFF AND DIE!" We'd never been on
	a stage where there'd been guerrillas to protect us from the
	audience, but this time there was, so we thought, 'Great! Now
	we'll do 'Partytime'. Now we'll do 'Love Kittens'', and we just
	played all these ballads at these rabid gothics, it was great.
	And they hated us. After the show, I said to Kevin, 'Well, thanks
	for asking us to do it, mate. It was quite an experience.' And he
	said, 'It wasn't me.' And it turned out it was his big brother,
	Dave, who I'd never met at that stage. We just got on really
	well. We all sort of started hanging out. When he joined the
	band, we knew he was going to leave again. He joined officially
	for six months, but he ended up doing about ten.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Earlier, you had mentioned comparisons to
	other artists, such as Lloyd Cole. On the insert to the Spooky
	EP, you commented on a critic who likened you to Robyn
	Hitchcock...
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Ah, that was one particularly nasty review.
	A really stupid review. He basically accused me of peddling the
	English 'eccentric' angle, and said, 'I'm so tired of this Robyn
	Hitchcock business. Let me tell you, there is no one more tired
	of this English eccentric Robyn Hitchcock business than I am. I
	like Robyn's records, and I get on with him all right as a bloke,
	but I get kind of tired of living in his shadow, because I don't
	think we're doing the same thing. I just think we're a group that
	writes halfway decent lyrics and has a few tunes. I mean, I've
	been following Robyn since 1978 when he was in the Soft Boys. I
	used to like them, and I'd see them now and again, and nowadays,
	we play with him. I've had a lot of trouble being compared with
	people, I don't think I'm comparable with him. Okay, we both play
	telecasters, and we both write tunes, which might be kind of
	rare, and indeed in the context of rock these days might be
	tagged 'eccentric,' but only in a rock way. He's into messin'
	with words much more than I am. He writes in code, I write in
	plain English. It's very rare that you'll not find me writing
	in...
	</div>

	Suddenly, and very coincidentally, "Heaven" by Robyn Hitchcock comes on the stereo.

	<div class="iview_a"> (Incensed, screaming) GO AWAY! LEAVE ME
	ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE! I'LL DO ANYTHING JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!
	Great song though, isn't it? He's imaginative. He uses codes. I'm
	much more down to Earth. One thing I keep meaning to explain, it
	comes too early in the set for me to start gabbing at the
	audience, in case I don't stop. But I've noticed in the song
	'Chickentown,' there's a line about 'smoking forty grotty fags a
	day'. Now to me that's just basic colloquial English. Smoking
	fags, I mean...it sounds like NWA, doesn't it? I mean, it's like,
	'I see a fag, I SMOKE him!' Sometimes I think I should just stop
	and explain to the audience what's going on here. Because if
	anybody hears that going by, they're going to think, 'What is
	this, Axl Rose in a suit?'
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> What songs do you enjoy playing live?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> 'Angels' I really like playing, when it goes
	well.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> That's one of my favorites, although
	there's an obtuseness to the lyric, I've never really been able
	to piece it together.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I'm glad you like it, it means a lot to me.
	I was very pleased, the other day I was reading 'Melody Maker,'
	and Phil Parfitt, who is the songwriter for the Perfect Disaster
	had been asked to write down his top ten songs. And there it was;
	Angels. And Phil's words were something like, "It's about
	having an international telephone line to angels, it's about
	dying...I don't know what it's about (laughs). I don't always
	know what the lyrics mean myself until I've been listening to
	them six months after it's done. You're right, that lyric is kind
	of obscure in a way.
	 When I wrote that song, I'd already recorded the music, and I
	had a lyric which was kind of a nasty lyric...basically I'm
	trying to write songs about death, sometimes, and whenever I get
	too involved in it, I sing the lyric, check out the tape and
	think, 'No, Patrick...forget it.' So I did that. I checked it
	out, and I went down to the studio kitchen, and I just got a
	piece of paper out and 'Angels' appeared on the page. I think I
	had to cross two lines out to make it fit the music. It just
	happened. I'm kind of a morbid chap. For someone who's got a
	reputation for being a jolly drinking song player, I'm actually
	quite a morbid sort of fellow.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> I don't know how evident that is in the
	music, for the most part.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Basically, I don't want to send people home
	in a bad temper. I think if people are going to pay money to see
	me, I want to give them a bit of a lift, you know? Hence this
	slightly demeaning spectacle of us doing 'The Devil is My Friend'
	at the end of the night, which was only really devised as a joke.
	But there's a bunch of people out there who, you know, they won't
	really go home happy unless you give it to them. Well, I don't
	want to make people unhappy.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> You do have more than a couple drinking
	anthems, I mean besides 'Partytime,' there's 'Drink' and 'Soul
	Happy Hour'.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I wrote that song at, like 10:30 in the
	morning at my typewriter at work. I had a hangover, and my boss
	was giving me trouble and I just hated the world. I thought, 'I
	just want to get really, horribly, vengefully drunk.' So I wrote
	this totally irresponsible song, and it actually says that
	Special Brew is good for you. Special Brew is not good for you,
	Special Brew will turn you into your parents. I'd sooner
	encourage people to take amphetamine on a daily basis than to
	become Special Brew addicts. It's just wicked.
	 I kind of get worried when people identify us with drinking
	tunes too much. Me and Max, when we were working together, would
	wind each other up to do a lot of crazy things. He really
	can...you wake up on his floor, and it's like 10:00 in the
	morning, he really will have you in the bars first thing.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Is there a lot of partying on tour? What
	happens after the show?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> It's a very simple life, touring. Basically
	it's singing, sitting, and talking is what it's about. There's
	not a lot of sex and drugs or anything. There's a fair amount of
	Rock and Roll. It's a cross between a fact-finding mission, a
	bombing raid, and one's hobby.

	I must confess to taking a complete sabbatical from the Jazz Butcher's
	music over the past couple years. In fact, I haven't checked in wiih lead
	Butcher Pat Fish's sonic noodlings since 1988's excellent, yet demented
	${fishco}. About the only thing I'd heard of late was bassist ${larry}
	was working with English band ${levit}.
	<p />
		Well, the folks down at Sky in Atlanta have licensed this corker
	from the British indie label ${creat}. And what has elevated that
	discerning label from the competition is certainly present here: guitars.
	More specifically, the sound of many guitars. They shimmer and swirl
	around, through, in and out of the JB's nine glorious tunes. At any
	one moment, there may be six different folks employing a barrage of
	six and 12- string instruments. And with stellar support from the
	likes of ${lix} (lead guitar) and ${joea} (bass) from ${strange}
	and ${paul} (drums) from the ${aero}, Fish has assembled a dynamic
	backing band. Old bandmate O'Keefe even shreds a lead guitar on "${harlan}."
	<p />
	Pat's music (and vocals) reminds me of a cross between the Go-Betweens and
	${hitch}, only with more edge and the keen addition of ${green}'s
	saxophones, which swoop and compliment the squall of guitar-invoked
	melodies (instead of dominating them like they did on Fishcotheque.)
	But, again, the real thrill is the guitars, employed here like a garrote:
	clean, and dangerously effective. Witness their delicate nature as they
	cascade and slice on the mid-tempo "Harlan" or the beautiful instrumental
	ballad "${monkey}." The latter could be soundtrack music for some film
	noir from France circa 1964, maybe even a deliberate play on Slaughter
	on Tenth Avenue. The tone is all moody and intriguing with its
	vocal-sample and spoken-word interplay and the cer accordjan appergio
	as the song builds to its conclusion. But the real smoker in the single
	"${yo}" with its rip-roaring bouncy guitar tweaked with a proper dollop
	of feedback. This--and the rest of the CD--is the kind of blue
	condition one sees in the high intensity of a fire.

	${para}The Jazz Butcher and his unflappable guitarist ${max} first
	surfaced in 1983 with the release of ${bacon} on the small
	London independent label ${glass}. Melody Maker recommended
	the album to <i>"Anyone looking for something really wild,"</i> while
	The Scotsman deemed it, <i>"Quite good fun, if you don't mind being
	used in someone else's experiment."</i>
	${para}
	The second Jazz Butcher album in
	1984, ${scandal},
	attracted much more attention, and over the next year Pat and
	Max (together with the rhythm section of ${dj} (formerly of
	${haus}) and ${owen}) <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984">toured the U.K. and Europe</a>
	in support of the album, which figured for weeks on the independent charts.
	Sounds called the following album, ${sex}, <i>"The best pop
	record in the world. Seriously."</i>
	${para}
	In the summer of 1986 a compilation of the Butcher's early recordings,
	${nons}, was released in America, where it made No. 2
	on the Gavin and CMJ charts. But after releasing a fourth album,
	${dist}, and
	undertaking another European tour, the Butcher and Max parted
	ways. Max went on to record for Big Time Records, releasing
	his solo album ${best_kisser} in 1987, while the
	Butcher continued his career by signing with ${creat}.
	${para}
	The Butcher's 1988 album, ${fishco}, was praised in Rolling
	Stone as establishing the Butcher as <i>"King of his own particular
	musical domain,"</i> and a sold-out summer
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1988">tour of North America</a>
	helped to make the album the Butcher's biggest seller to date.
	1989 saw the release of ${planet}, which succeeded

	with only a brief break to record ${cult}. Described
	by CMJ as <i>"A peerless piece of Britpop"</i> on its release in September
	1990, Basement featured the radio hit "${drugs}" and the
	single "${go}." Melody Maker found the album to be <i>"As languid
	and graceful a slice of slush as you could dare to dream."</i> Reviewing
	the same release, Sounds wondered why the Butcher was not <i>"As

	${para}
	The Butcher next recorded ${blue} in 1991. West Coast
	DJ ${deirdre} called it <i>"The work of his [sic] lifetime." </i>
	The album spawned radio hits like "${yo}" and "${shirl}."
	The Butcher remained with Creation and released two more albums.
	Waiting for ${bus}, released in 1993, was described by

	featured both Pat and Max. So it was decided that a United States
	tour was in order, and in September 1999 Pat and Max arrived
	Stateside to perform at sold-out shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
	Portland, Seattle, and New York, where they were accompanied
	by other old-school Jazz Butcher musicians ${owen}, and David
	J. and ${hask} (both of Bauhaus and ${rocket} fame).
	It had been thirteen years since Pat and Max last toured the
	U.S. together.
	${para}
	The response was so resoundingly positive that only one thing
	could result: Max Eider has officially rejoined the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy!
	The year 2000 finds The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy - Pat Fish and
	Max Eider - very busy indeed. A live album entitled ${glorious},
	recorded at a <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1999/Feb26.html">1999 show in Hamburg,</a>
	is set for release
	in February by Reachout International Records (ROIR) of New York.
	The Conspiracy also has lengthy travel plans ahead, with a spring
	tour in the U.S., a summer tour in Europe, and dates that will
	take them to Japan and Australia. In between touring, Pat and
	Max will return to the recording studio, and fans can look forward
	to hearing a <a href="${jbc_albums}/rotten.html">fresh album of all
	new material by year's end</a>.

		<p />
		Born in West London at a time that left him just too young to be a hippie and just a little too old to be a punk, Pat Fish grew up in an era where the Bonzo Dog Band appeared on children’s television, Syd Barrett was on Top of the Pops and the Adult World was represented in shows like The Avengers and The Prisoner. Disappointment was an inevitability.
		<p />
		Fish failed to “get” the glam rock thing (probably too much of an excitable wee football fan) and found that the seventies drove him down some fairly obscure musical paths before punk rock came along to save the day. By then, however, all those mad little songs by Eno, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen, John Cale, Peter Blegvad and Tony Moore were already locked up in his head.
		<p />
		Fish started making records under the name of the Jazz Butcher in 1983 and nobody has quite succeeded in putting a stop to this yet. He has recorded for Glass Records, Creation Records, ROIR of New York and Vinyl Japan of Tokyo. Overall he has written and released fifteen albums of original music, three live albums and innumerable singles and compilations.
		<p />
		In 2016 Fire Records issued the album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, originally released as a fan-funded project in 2012. In 2017 Fire will be undertaking a major re-issue programme, making several Jazz Butcher albums available once again on vinyl, CD and digital formats.
		<p />
		With the Jazz Butcher, Fish has toured worldwide. As a solo artist, recent shows include Hamburg, Dortmund, New York City, Tokyo, Brussels and London, as well as his adopted home town of Northampton where he still regularly turns out with his acoustic guitar to support visiting artists.
		<p />
		He likes collaborations, too. Apart from his lengthy association with Northampton-based digital hooligans Wilson over the years 2001-2009, Fish has recorded and appeared on stage with David J, Spacemen 3, Bristol’s The Blue Aeroplanes, German band M Walking On The Water, French indie art rock band Chelsea Paris and acclaimed Los Angeles shoegazers, The Black Watch.
		<p />
		The thing about Pat Fish is that he is not tribal about music. Some people know him from his friendship with Spacemen 3, others for his fondness for Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; some know him because he has worked with members of Bauhaus, others regard him as a “classic” independent songwriter in the vein of Pete Astor or Dan Treacy. Fishy just fetches his acoustic guitar and his notebook and heads for the railway station.
		<p />
		His current inspirations: as always, the Velvet Underground, Alex Chilton, Peter Laughner, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers, John Martyn, Davy Graham and many, many more.
		<p />
		Do you like your melodies sweet and your humour as black as pitch? Would you take a chance on something simple, intimate and direct from an artist who is on record as saying “What I do is not entertainment” but who regularly induces little bursts of outraged laughter from the audience? Do you want to see the real thing? You should maybe go and see Pat Fish.

	The Jazz Butcher and his unflappable guitarist Max Eider first surfaced in 1983 with the album Bath Of Bacon on the London independent label Glass Records. Melody Maker recommended the album to "Anyone looking for something really wild," while The Scotsman deemed it, "Quite good fun, if you don't mind being used in someone else's experiment."
	<p />
	In 1984 he second album, A Scandal In Bohemia, attracted much more attention, and over the next year Pat and Max together with the rhythm section of David J. and Owen Jones toured the UK and Europe in support of the album, which figured for weeks on the independent charts. Sounds called the following album, Sex And Travel, "The best pop record in the world. Seriously."
	<p />
	In 1986 a compilation of the Butcher's early recordings, Bloody Nonsense, was released in America, where it made No. 2 on the Gavin and CMJ charts and a successful North American tour followed. After releasing a fourth album, Distressed Gentlefolk, and undertaking another European tour, the Butcher and Max parted ways. Max went on to release his solo album The Best Kisser In The World in 1987, while the Butcher continued his career by signing with Creation Records.
	<p />
	The Butcher's 1988 album, Fishcotheque, was praised in Rolling Stone as establishing the Butcher as "King of his own particular musical domain," and a sold-out summer tour of North America helped to make the album the Butcher's biggest seller to date. 1989 saw the release of Big Planet, Scary Planet, which topped MTV's alternative chart. Endless touring followed, with only a brief break to record Cult Of The Basement. Described by CMJ as "A peerless piece of Britpop" on its release in 1990, Basement featured the radio hit She's On Drugs and the single Girl Go. Melody Maker found it to be "as languid and graceful a slice of slush as you could dare to dream." Reviewing the same release, Sounds wondered why the Butcher was not "As big as George Michael."
	<p />
	The Butcher recorded Condition Blue in 1991. West Coast DJ ${deirdre} called it "The work of his lifetime." The album spawned radio hits like She's A Yo Yo and Shirley Maclaine. Waiting for Waiting For The Love Bus, released in 1993, was described by the Trouser Press Record Guide as "Fish at his most seductive and romantic, and it makes for his greatest achievement ...in all, the perfect Jazz Butcher recording, one that would be hard to top for sheer entertainment value." In October 1993 the Butcher was privileged to open for John Cale at London's Forum. Illuminate, the tenth Jazz Butcher album, which David J. produced, was released in 1995.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher ceased trading at the end of 1995, with Fish going on to record the Sumosonic album This Is Sumo for Creation in 1998. But unexpectedly, the Butcher and Max Eider began to perform together once again at occasional live events.
	<p />
	Over the next few years demand began to boil over. Fans world-wide were excited by the prospect of a Jazz Butcher Conspiracy that featured both Pat and Max. So it was decided that a US tour was in order, and in September 1999 Pat and Max played sold-out shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and New York, where they were accompanied by other old-school Jazz Butcher musicians Owen Jones, and David J. and Kevin Haskins.
	<p />
	There was a burst of activity at the turn of the millennium, involving tours of America and Europe and a first trip to Japan, all culminating in the middle of the World Cup of 2002 with the singer and the bassist seizing control of a digital projector in the lovely main square of a Belgian town to project the message "Has anybody got any POT?"
	<p />
	Apart from a brief visit to Los Angeles in 2009, activity since then has been limited to a few UK club appearances. Max has made two fantastic solo records on his own Tundra Ducks label. Pat played for eight years with his band Wilson, whose DVD No Known Predators was released in September 2012. He also plays solo gigs where and whenever he can.
	<p />
	Keen to play some shows to celebrate the band's 30th Anniversary, Fish and Eider began to think about making another record. Their experiment with "fan-funding" worked, producer Richard Formby was engaged...and so it is that the Jazz Butcher's 12th album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, was released in the December 2012.
	<p />
	Since then there have been further gigs in the UK, Belgium, Germany and Japan.

	<div class="iview_intro">
	 Music Editor
	 Chris Handyside converses with the Jazz Butcher's Pat Fish about music, movies, Kid Rock, Blur, guns
	 and more.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	<b>Metro Times: </b>Are you laying down tracks for a new studio record?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	<b>Pat Fish:</b> I suppose you're about the first to know, but just before
	Christmas a company called Vinyl Japan appeared on my computer and said
	"Do you want to make a record?" Max and I went down to have
	a chat with them and the chap said, "We'll give you a small
	advance. 500 pounds for recording and 2000 pounds for beer," and
	we went, "Yep." 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Sounds perfect...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, unbelievably, here we are making a record in the year 2000. I don't
	know what's on their minds.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So you're recording with the <a href="http://www.jazzbutcher.com" target="_blank">Jazz
	Butcher Conspiracy</a>?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, Max and I are the core of it and we've had some mates come
	in and do some congas and that.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	What prompted the reunion of the JBC?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well Max and I have been sort of quietly playing together again since
	1997. But mostly at private events. We finished off, as the Butcher was
	splitting up in 1995 - do you really want the history?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Sure.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	We split up at the end of '95, and for the last few gigs Max had been
	showing up and doing a bit of guitar here and there, and when we did the
	last it was quite a good one. We had all our mates come and it was quite
	a boozer. We finished it, on the second encore we did a version of that
	old ballad "Angels" and we made a big zero of it quite honestly,
	Chris. We left the bugger on sort of a half note, but, hey, we'd
	split up, we're not bothered. Then in August '96 a weird thing happened.
	Some guys down in Majorca wanted to book us, and of course they didn't
	know that we'd split up. So we went down to that, we thought, "Hell,
	it's a trip to Majorca." And when we finished that gig we thought,
	"Yeah, there we go. Now we've really done it. Now we can stop."
	<p />
	But
	the following year, a couple in Seattle called and said they were going
	to get married and that they'd fly me and a mate out to play the
	wedding. And I thought, "Well, I'm no fool. I'm going."
	
	<p />
	I talked
	to Max and, yup, he was up for it. We did that, and we had a really good
	time. We had some mates from Seattle playing with us. We had Joe from
	the Posies playing bass. And Greg, the guy that played drums for Mother
	Love Bone. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	The couple were just big fans?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, really, they were the ones that kept us together, 'cause we thought
	the '96 gig was the end. The line is it's their band, we just play
	in it.
	<p />
	But they're
	lovely people. Then we did another wedding in '98. And then I got e-mailed
	up and after that, the demand meets the supply much more quickly then,
	doesn't it?
	<p />
	And last
	year we ended up doing about ten gigs. And there's this live record
	that ROIR did of a live gig we did in Germany and when that came out I
	thought, "Blimey, we're a bit back, aren't we?" 
	<p />
	And then
	when Vinyl Japan came up at Christmas, it was just "Aaw, bloody hell,
	we're just going to have to admit that we exist again." 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So the Jazz Butcher never really went away...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's funny, because five years ago that brand name was such a millstone
	around our necks, and now it's clear that that's our brand name
	for life. No matter what else you do. I have to go on record - 'cause
	you're like, the press - as saying "All right, we're back.
	But we're not competing."
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You're not in the market for the arena rock shows?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	We're just in the market for having a good time all the time. It's
	really come out of a series of little holidays.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So the expectations are just to have a really long holiday.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, travel around, see our mates, drink a lot of free beer and entertain
	people while we're doing it. I hope that we'll be good.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So, this is a return to the nebulous conspiracy of folk?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, we actually have achieved a cross-generational lineup, 'cause we're
	recording the album in the home studio of Pete Crouch who played in the
	band around '94-'95. We're almost keen not to put a date on the record
	at all.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Do a lot of people tell you stories about how they discovered your music?
	It's like all the Jazz Butcher fans are coming out of the closet?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	You do get stuff like that. One or two of them are marvelous, 'cause they
	insist that they saw me in years that I wasn't even in the country.
	"Yeah, I saw you in Minneapolis in '93." I didn't
	go to Minneapolis in '93. But they insist that it's me that's
	wrong, you know? I don't know how many drugs they think I take.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Let them have their memory, whatever they think it is...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, but you do get some quite touching ones now and again. When you're
	a musician you don't really expect to feel useful like a doctor or
	a miner or a bus driver or that. But occasionally you do, you get someone
	who says, "Ooh, man, I don't know what I would've done
	without your LP.' It's just like, "Oh, that's nice."
	It's very difficult to kow what to say in a situation like that,
	apart from "Thank you." Even if you do know what it means to
	them and you're pleased, you can't really say, (in a stuffy
	voice) "Oh, well - I'm pleased."
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	What's been your experience with America - both good and bad -
	considering that many people characterize you as a very "British
	artist"?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, I'm kind of curious, too. The first thing you've got to
	say about this music - this pop music, this rock music, this song music,
	whatever you want to call it - is that it's American. And really,
	guys from England have got no more right to make it than guys from Denmark
	or something.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	But everyone's got a right to make it.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, they can't be stopped, can they? But it's a funny thing,
	because people do see us as being all English and that, and I suppose
	you can't help being English. But certainly for me and Max, we're
	very conscious of the fact that nearly all the music we like comes from
	America.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Like who?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Oh, god, what a list. Any list that's got Brian Eno and Chuck D.
	on the same one... Better put KRS-1 on there, too. I've spent
	the last five years barely listening to any white boy music to tell you
	the truth. Hip-hop, old soul, what they call here "Northern Soul."
	Northampton's always been a bit of a big town for that kind of thing.
	
	<p />
	You're
	from Detroit. I'll tell you what I've been really discovering
	a lot after we did that deal with ROIR and I went through their offices
	and looted it - what a cool label! I'm on the same label as
	Lee Perry! One of the things I picked up was an MC5 album, a collection
	of their shit. I actually suggested to the team that we try an MC5 number
	when we're in Detroit, but I supposed we'd all be stoned to
	death for that.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	I think that'd be endearing. Enough bands from Detroit do it...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I'll tell you. I've got this friend Ian, and he was the singer
	in my other band Sumosonic in the middle of the `90s, and he's
	been coming around every Tuesday or Wednesday for the last couple months
	as I cranked up to do the record with a little bag of something: some
	ROCK CDs. He don't want me to pussy out when I'm recording.
	You know we've done that so often. We've never reflected what
	ugly bastards we all are.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You seem so nice and gentle...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, he's been coming around specifically to be my "Rock Doctor"
	and the last two things he brought me were Eminem
	and Kid
	Rock, who I strongly suspect was quite an influence on Eminem. He's
	got a penchant for the self-pitying ballad amongst the bad motherfucker
	songs, though. It's a bit Bob Seger every once and again.
	<p />
	But you
	were asking me who my musical heroes were... Soul music's been
	really important. When we started out, what we'd say to people about
	what we were trying to achieve as English white pussies, what we were
	trying to prove or investigate, was what would've happened if you
	kind of particle-accelerated the sound of the Velvets with the sound of
	'60s soul, but with low budgets; and not really knowing how to record,
	we didn't get there for a really long, long time.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Do you think you reached that?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I don't know. But there's a grotesquely Motown number on this
	new record. You know that big old beat on the one - it's got that
	and all the squeaky vocals, and I'm doing a Smokey on it. I don't
	know. It's not that accomplished a Smokey, I've got to tell
	you. But me and Max are just up to our necks in soul music. It's
	really those twin towers of soul music and punk...
	<p />
	But like,
	with Cult of the Basement, what we were into in those days, was what Richard
	Fornby called "those records," like Big Star's third or the
	Velvets' third. And when we were making <i>Basement, </i>a fellow from
	Creation phoned up and they were just starting to scrape the charts with
	a few things, and the guy says to me, "Ahh well, Pat, you got any
	hits on your album, then?"
	<p />
	I said,
	"There aren't hits, Dick. You'll be lucky if this fucker
	sells eight copies! We're committing commercial suicide in here!"
	And he hung the phone up on me. And when they got it, when they got the
	record, they were hopping from foot to foot going, "Ooh, this is
	the best you've done in years!" So you can't predict what
	we're doing.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So, are there some songs that you just can't not play?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, yeah, that's the case. Well, I'll tell you one thing
	that's been fun, actually, is that since Max left the group in '86
	and we carried on making records, it's been ever so much fun going
	out and playing tunes that we recorded after he left. Things like "She's
	on Drugs" - just seeing what he's going to do with it.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Has he been pretty adaptable? 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Bloody hell! I've got a CD of a show we did in Seattle - and
	you know how people insist on taking tapes off the board even though all
	you ever get is kick drum and vocal? Well this one, there's a twist
	to it - it's kick drum, vocal and Max. It's a collector's
	item. You listen to "She's on Drugs" on that and it's
	just like being beaten up or something. It's brutal. That's
	a lot of good fun, that is.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Are you a hopeless lyrical romantic? I catch, if anything, sort of a bemused
	jadedness.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, I'm a much more jaded and nasty bloke that it often comes across.
	I sort of like when I get in the studio and I've got a pair of headphones
	on - it's like those sounds flying around in me head. I sort of
	like that wide-eyed thing. I like pop that's all so wide-eyed like
	(in wide-eyed voice), "Aaw, it's all so impossible."
	<p />
	I wish
	I could sing better to put some oomph into it, but you work with what
	you got.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You're doing some art, too, when you come here?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Ah, yes, the C-Pop
	thing. Well, it's an odd one. We were completely baffled. When
	the show got booked, the fella said, "We got this art gallery next
	door; would you like to show some artwork?" And we didn't know
	what he meant. And I'll always remember reading this biography of
	Burroughs, and he said he never made any money off his writing to speak
	of, that it was only when he, like, started shooting cans of paint that
	he suddenly made lots of dough. And I guess it's the same with Don
	Van Vliet, as well. But we were just laughing our heads off. 
	<p />
	But I've
	got this really bad habit. Some people play Sim City. Not me, 'cause I
	only got a computer recently. I used to sit there with my little notebooks
	and draw towns, draw maps of imaginary towns with felt tips. What an idiot,
	right?
	<p />
	When
	this idea first came up, I thought, "Ah, well, I'll just send
	'em me maps and it'll be seen as like outsider art." And I thought,"'ello,
	here we go." But, as it goes, and here's a nice local angle
	for the paper, do you know ${dave_coverly}? He does a cartoon called Speed Bump.
	He lives down in Ann Arbor and he's a good old mate, a
	lovely chap. And a year or so ago he got on me and said, "Pat, I
	want to do a kids' book. Do it with me." And I said, "What?!"
	As far as I'm concerned, when you buy a box of matches and it says
	"Keep away from children," that's really good advice. Especially
	in the current climate over here - being a single, middle-aged man,
	it's like, "What? Pervert. Hang him up." You got to be
	a bit careful. Anyway, Dave comes up with this and we have a little chat,
	and what has come out is that we've collaborated. He's taken
	the lyrics to "Buffalo Shame" of Distressed Gentlefolk -
	which was always doomed to failure, because how was a little white pussy
	bloke going to sing like a fucking buffalo?! It's not happening is
	it? I can't listen to that tune without cringing. But on the other
	hand, Dave's a great artist and once he starts drawing buffalos in
	a slightly cartoony style, but quite accurate - once he starts drawing
	the buggers and writing the words, then it turns into something else.
	So we did this thing, and he said "Pat, when you come through Detroit,
	it's going to be ready for you to check out." 
	<p />
	So <i>then</i>
	I thought, "Hold on! Art exhibition, Dave Coverly, Detroit."
	So there it is. We're going to take the book and present it as a
	work in progress.
	<p />
	And my
	work was finished in 1986.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	I get such a sense of place in your songs. Even a touch of the cinematic.
	Is that something you concentrate on?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I'm really into the sense of place. I'm famous among my pals
	for having the memory of two elephants. I'm the sort of bastard who'll
	tell you what hotel I stayed in in Munich in 1986. They're like,
	"Pat, get something useful in your head!"
	<p />
	But I
	can't help it. I'm an accumulator of information, but place
	and that sense of travel - that's something that's really
	important to me. There's a line on one of the songs on this new record
	that says, 'They're just missing persons who reappeared," and
	that's directly lifted from a Wim Wenders movie I saw the other night.
	But I never go to the cinema. The last time I went was (laughing) <i>Doctor</i>
	fucking <i>Doolitle</i> with Eddie Murphy! A guinea pig movie!
	<p />
	It's
	just that you go to the movies in England and it's incredibly expensive.
	It's really a lowest common denominator experience, and you get mugged
	for the money. And the place is just full of video generation people who
	don't know they have to shut up while the film is on. It's just
	a fucking nuisance. I just tend to watch things on video in my living
	room where I can just keep quiet.
	<p />
	Though
	I did notice when I went to the pictures in America, I was thrilled, because
	everyone does just shut up and pay attention. Who says you lot have got
	short attention spans? The fucking rubbish they talk about America over
	here sometimes... like the New Musical Express, they're always
	going on about (affects buffoon voice) "What do stupid Americans
	know about pop music?" Excuse me! Where did Chuck Berry come from?
	Where did James Brown come from? Fuck! But it happens all the time, like
	"Oh, Americans don't like Blur. Stupid Americans." It's
	like, "No." I think "Stupid Blur" is what you're
	trying to say, isn't it boys and girls? 
	<p />
	Back
	in '92 we were touring, and Blur was just kicking off. They were already
	quite popular here, and they'd gone off to do some tour of America.
	And in Baltimore, we were playing in this little shed, and they were playing
	in this little shed a couple days before, and I'll bet they were
	really annoyed when they opened the local paper and found that we were
	"Gig of the Week." That made me laugh a lot. But not as much
	as when I was talking to the promoter after the show, having a beer, and
	he said, "Oh, those guys from Blur - what a gang of fuckin'
	idiots." 
	<p />
	And I
	said, "Well, what happened?" He said, "Oh, they thought
	the place was beneath them and they started breaking shit up." And
	I said, "Oh, what did you do?" He said "Oh, I got my shooter
	out." He pulled his fucking revolver out.

	Pat Fish is the last of the great British Troubadours, the epitome of ‘Have Guitar, Will Travel’.	
	<p />
	He used to have a band and he used to have cancer, he now has neither. Alan McGee once said of Fish “The Jazz Butcher is one of the most brilliant incisive pop writers that Britain has produced since the glory days of Ray Davies and Pete Townsend” and he isn’t wrong, cruelly underrated and too intelligent for his own good. Fish kicks off proceedings with a stripped down <i>Keeping the Curtains Closed</i> from his rather magnificent and aptly named Fishcoteque album. A relatively new song but a set mainstay for a while now is <i>Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar </i>– a tale from the posh side of Liverpool apparently. From here on in though he dips into his mid ‘80’s Glass Records catalogue by dusting down the fabulous <i>Vienna Song </i>dusted down and dedicated to this writer, its my favourite Fish ditty you see and he knows it. Fish, trips and glides through <i>Big Saturday</i> (from the <i>Sex and Travel</i> album, which contained the last Jazz Butcher recordings featuring David J within its ranks – a fond farewell, Sex and Travel  -  geddit?). <i>The Human Jungle</i> steals its title from an early sixties TV series starring Herbert Lom, again faithfully reproduced. It’s actually very enjoyable to hear these former full band compositions played as they were originally created, bashed out on a guitar. He closes his all too short set with a relatively new one; <i>Never Give Up</i> “I agree with Dave, Embrace Your Dysfunction” the latest nod to his former JB colleague and current headliner. Actually these little lyrical quips do appear from time to time, they are also reciprocated, you just need to know where to find them….Fish is called back for an encore by the handful of enthusiastic punters, “any requests?” closing the evening’s set with the very song that kick started The Jazz Butcher all those years ago; <i>Southern Mark Smith.</i> Fish, Opting to replicate the arrangement from <i>A Scandal in Bohemia </i>rather than the fast paced 45 version the predated it….	
	<p />
	David J ambles on with his two band mates, a mini orchestra if you will, for this evening’s performance, pianist Robert Vasicek and violinist Karel Holas both veterans of the recent album sessions. His set is declared open with a faithful reading of <i>Not Long for This World</i> the title track from his 2011 opus. Here to promote his new album <i>Missive to an Angel from the Halls of Infamy and Allure</i> David, Robert and Karel dip heavily into that project tonight. <i>I Hear Only Silence Now</i> is delivered in its new arrangement (sans Emily Jane White’s ethereal vocal), renditions of <i>The Auteur</i>, <i>Blue Eyes in the Green Room, Copper Level Seven </i>and the haunting <i>Clandestine Valentine </i>follow<i>,</i> but its the title track that packs the punch this evening with an astonishing violin played by Holas, a musician who is clearly at the very top of his game. David authentically reproduces the title track from 1985’s <i>Crocodile Tears and The Velvet Cosh </i>a song that has had more lyrical rewrites than…	
	<p />
A new jazz tinged arrangement of <i>Candy on the Cross </i>at times bears some slightly off kilter resemblance to The Doors <i>Alabama Song, </i>this once fragile haunting number now takes on a new resonance in this alternative reading. <i>Candy</i> is a sordid tale of teenage prostitution on the Caledonian Road as witnessed first-hand by the song’s writer whilst spending time in London in the early 1990’s. David is an incredible observational writer and lyrically he reached his zenith on this one. <i> </i>	
	<p />
	Woven into this evenings set is a pair of hand-picked<i> </i>Love and Rockets numbers. Thrown in for good measure are <i>Dog-End of a Day Gone By</i> from their Psychedelia tinged debut album 1985’s <i>Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven</i> and <i>Shelf Life (</i>from <i>Sweet F.A). </i>The latter, as David explains, was <i> </i>written directly after its author had received a phone call from a charming MCA representative informing him that no follow up album to <i>Urban Urbane </i>would be required….”How many A&R men does it take to change a light bulb? I’ll get back to you on that…” <i> </i> 	
	<p />
	January 10 2016 is a day etched deep into our psyche, it is of course <i>The Day That David Bowie Died</i> where were you asks David before telling his own personal story in song. The sentiments captured within its lyric I’m sure are shared the world over.	
	<p />
A project with Dark Flowers’ Paul Statham (B Movie, 100 Men) has spawned <i>The Stars Stand In</i>, (to be included on the forthcoming Dark Flowers album; <i>Indian Summer</i>)<i> </i>the result of this intriguing collaboration is performed this evening.	
	<p />
	Initially this UK leg of his “Missives and Miles” Tour was to include dates in Nottingham and Newcastle both unfortunately fell, due to “Some other band reforming” that “other” band is of course Bauhaus who are due to grace the Palladium in Hollywood very shortly with a series of sell out shows. David had to cut his tour short to attend rehearsals. Bauhaus are represented here this evening with David’s grand statement; <i>Who Killed Mr Moonlight?</i> 	
	<p />
	Knocked out during sound-check earlier, the trio trialled Sinatra’s <i>classic It Was a Very Good Year</i> authentically and stylishly reproduced as this evening’s set closer. David, resplendent in Fedora, croons his way through Ervin Drakes ’61 original, performed initially by Bob Shane with the Kingston Trio but its Sinatra’s 1966 interpretation that’s recreated, it struck me whilst watching this particular performance how suited to this style David actually is. Some of his best work has seen him delivering almost spoken word set to a collage of soundscapes, not dissimilar to the arrangement of <i>It Was a Very Good Year</i>. David J has recently suggested that <i>Missive to an Angel from the Halls of Infamy and Allure</i> could be his swansong, his final solo album. We could be at a crossroad.

It has been years since I last saw anyone play at the Hope & Anchor and its recent makeover has made it once again a venue worth going to with great beer selection meaning I could drink this week's most appropriate beer yes I had some Twisted Thistle to keep the union together with. It was also cool to once again be at a gig promoted by Tony Fraser who put on so many of the gigs I was at in the 80's and onwards good to see him still putting on the odd cool show.
	<p />
When I first went downstairs with Sterling Roswell into the gig room for Spectraglow he wasn't in the band but by the time I'd said hello to Tony Fraser, Texas Bob Juarez had persuaded Sterling to join him and his companero as the bands drummer. I think the other guitarist may well have been in  the Television Personalities along with Texas Bob at some point as they played a set of Television Personalities songs that opened with a spectral and very cool version of Hamburg Skies that saw Sterling Roswell feeling his way round the basic kit gingerly.
	<p />
Picture Of Dorian Gray was very cool indeed and I think the loose jammed feel worked well as it also did on Look Back In Anger. In between songs they had chats as to what to play next and Sterling asked every once in a while if it was a fast or slow number or what time it was in although he seemed pretty comfortable playing on I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives that also had some pretty nifty guitar work on it. They finished the set with King & Country that just about held together and was a cool close to a nice set.
	<p />
Next on where Elia & The Low Tears who for this show were playing as a trio of acoustic Guitar, Baritone Sax and vocals and for me they were all about the girl who was seated playing the Baritone Sax her stabs and tone just brought the bittersweet soul songs Elia was singing to life. Plenty of songs of regret the best song in the set was probably Perfect Circles apparently about an obsessive fans videos of the bands tunes. But I have to have a sneaking respect for any band who tell us the next song is inspired by reading John Paul Sartres The Reprieve well absolutely a pretty cool song as well and easier to listen to than Sartre is to read. 
	<p />
Dirt Road about the shit of life wasn't as harrowing as it might sound and they finished a decent set with Violins played of course without any violins but Elia has a cool voice and that baritone Sax needs to be heard live.
	<p />
Well since The Jazz Butcher last played in London a few weeks ago there has been a slight change of Personnel as Max Eider has decided to retire from live performance and he's been replaced by Simon Taylor who as you'd expect plays trumpet!! Yes they have replaced the guitarist with a trumpeter. They are now a proper Jazz Quartet and also apparently fully paid up members of the Thursday club which is apparently the Northampton Musicians equivalent to the Monday Club only not quite as dodgy.
	<p />
They opened the set with a nice instrumental that showed off Simon Taylor's skills nicely as he played his trumpet with the first of a series of different Mutes as the two Steve's set the tone for a good laid back set of very restrained back porch jazz or in this case Cellar jazz.
	<p />
Animals worked very well in this setting with Pat's vocals also rather languidly accompanied by his slow strumming. Steve New's Double Bass seemed to drive Tombe Dans Les Pommes that has an English intro before Pat slipped seamlessly into the songs French lyrics the trumpet seemed to make it sound even more like a Jaques Brel song than ever. 
	<p />
There was a good bit of joking between songs and the nature of the lyrics on Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers played into that well as it became apparent just how tight the Thursday club were the differing mutes on the trumpet adding different textures as Steve Garofolo mainly played his drums with Brushes I think this was the song that actually had a little ballroom dancing going on.
	<p />
Black Raoul has been a live favourite for years now and the current cool Jazz setting suits it perfectly with the almost walking bass style mimicking a cat strolling around this cellar we are in. We then got a new song that I guess is called Whose That Man With the Black Moustache that is sort of Django Reinhardt meets Jaques Brel but with a twist of Slim Gaillard for good measure and humour it was very cool.
	<p />
Melanie Hargreaves Fathers Jaguar could have been about a cat but is about a car and is a good counterpoint to the old classic Caroline Wheelers Birthday Present, but no one wants to see a Jaguar end up like the one in this song ends up, I look forward to hearing a recorded version of this song soon.
	<p />
Pat then dipped deep into the back catalogue for a very cool version of Living In A Village being played live for the first time in well forever or decades at the least before they went all Jimi Hendrix meets Trad Gras Och Stenar on a super laid back jazzed out version of Bobby Dylans All Along The Watchtower during which there was a bit of a commotion and most of us were shocked to see security leading a woman out of the Hope and Anchor whatever had she done! 
	<p />
Last time out Solar Core was the closest they came to rocking out this time it was a bit mellower and went a bit psych jazz almost into Sound Of Joy era Sun Ra but obviously with male vocals as Pat doesn't sound like June Tyson at all. Well with one person already ejected it really was Party Time and most of us were singing along as it was played at wallflower pace we were having an extraordinary time of it and everyone was smiling nicely.
	<p />
The next song to go all Jazzy for us was the Rave rock classic Quality People that Pat used to play with Wilson only now it was all cool jazz and about halfway through it twisted into Gloria that of course got everyone singing to the chorus. They closed the set with another great version of Slim Gaillards Dunkin' Bagels In the Coffee that the trumpet works brilliantly on and it was a perfect end to a very cool set now that the Jazz butcher has finally gone Jazz will he ever go back to Rockâ€¦.
	<p />
London has one more chance to See the JBQ at Come Down Meet the Folks in Clerkenwell next Sunday afternoon before they go off to Japan for a short tour.<br />

This is a night put on by Glass Modern at to give it it's full title The Memorable Order Of Tin Hats Club at The General Browning Old Trades Hall in Valette Street Hackney and the show is in the Reg Miller Memorial Hall, which is a brilliant glitter bedecked room that also has a Royal Box where the merch stall is set up as well as all sorts of militaria on the walls which somehow makes it seem like the perfect place for David J to play on his current tour promoting his new solo album Missive To An Angel From The Halls Of Infamy And Allure that's out now on Glass Modern and was mainly recorded in Prague with David's current Czech solo band.
	<p />
This evening was one of those when London's transport system and roads went a bit mad so that my journey that should have just been one train ride turned into 4 trains and bus the last of which dropped me in Graham Road that for me brought back memories of Saturdays in the very early 70's spent at my uncle's barbers and Hairdressers and being sent out onto Graham Road to buy cigarettes and sweets and of course back then they would serve a 6 year old kid with ciggies. So I was already in  full on nostalgia mode before I got into the M.O.T.H. Club thankfully still in time to see all of Pat Fish's opening set for one of the musicians who used to be in The Jazz Butcher with him back in the 80's when they were all on Glass records.
	<p />
Pat was playing solo on his Gretsch Electromatic he opened with Keeping The Curtains Closed form the Fishcoteque album and in the glitter bedecked stage and hall he was in going Fishco made sense it was either that or a glitter rock special but either way a perfect start to his set. We then got a proper obscurity with a version of Baltic that was only available as the bonus track on Waiting For The Love Bus and it sounded great with some very cool lyrics and great to hear it played live. 
	<p />
We then got a nice slow and yet still funky version of She's On Drugs that was the first song that made the actor Marc Warren pries himself off the wall he was leaning on for a closer listen. Pat then once again related the story of his lodgers answer to the question of what was the last car you saw being torched which of course was Melanie Hargreaves Fathers Jaguar and it's quite a tale and it seemed right to sing it here considering how often there used to be burnt out cars on Morning Lane round the corner from the M.O.T.H. club in the 70's.
	<p />
It being a Saturday night of course Pat sang Big Saturday and about a third of the way through one of the other fans sashayed onto the dance floor and started tap dancing and doing percussion on his arms and legs with his hands it was a great accompaniment that continued for part of The Human Jungle as well and well it's long over due for Pat to go tap although he generally only wants to know about the beer taps, we were certainly in a cool and trendy part of that human Jungle a great version.
	<p />
Pat then closed his set with his latest song about life's great miseries and coming out the other side of his cancer scare with the rather doleful Never Give Up that's full of good advice and a little bit of hope that things may once again seem ok.
	<p />
After the break it was time for David J Haskins and his two Czech accompanists Karel Holas on Violin and Robert Vasicek to bring the glitter to the bands dark toned music and after a false start while they sorted some small technical issues they opened with the wonderfully morbid Not Long For This World with the Violin and Piano starkly backing David as he brought this description of a funeral to life.
	<p />
I Hear Only Silence now was similarly sparse and beautiful with some nice accentuating of the vocals by the violin as David tried to quench his thirst. David then picked up his acoustic guitar for The Auteur a wonderfully stark tale from his last Solo album and the piano and acoustic guitar worked beautifully to help make this song feel like the soundtrack to the Auteurs finest work.
	<p />
Clandestine Valentine was preceded by a cool introduction from David and then the song slowly unfolded as this story of love with someone you can't be with all the time was made to feel beguiling and just how things must be sometimes.
	<p />
Blue Eyes in The Green Room is every bit as good a song as it is a song title and a great little tale of meeting the gaze of someone across a room and being enamored of them and then sitting and going on and on about them once you've had a drink or two more than you should have. 
	<p />
Copper Level 7 is a song that should probably be played back to back with Type O Negatives Black No 1 as "goth" songs about hair dye colors and of course all sorts of other stuff in both cases and with a smart re-mix or two this will no doubt turn into a floor filler a real highlight.
	<p />
David then went way back to one of his earliest solo albums made if my memories anywhere near right in between Bauhaus ending for the first time and Love And Money really getting going yes it was time for some Crocodile Tears And The Velvet Cosh to help lift everyone's blue mood although almost everyone was looking happy apart from Marc Warren who was concentrating so much on filming the whole show on his phone that he didn't seem to be able to show any emotion as to how great the  music he was filming was.
	<p />
Then it was time to dig into the roots of the blues and rock and roll with Feel Like Robert Johnson At The Three Forks Saloon that's a nice evocation of the spirits that were chasing poor Robert into his very early grave and seemed apt to be sung in a room with lots of memorials to people who died too soon.
	<p />
David kept the feel of memorializing the greats with Where Were You The Day David Bowie Died that allowed David to let go of just how traumatic it was when one of his main idols left the stage for the last time and as the first time I ever really connected to David J's music was through Bauhaus covering Ziggy Stardust I have to say  this really did work and was really heartfelt and a beautiful tribute to a real musical hero.
	<p />
For the third part of the tributes to the fallen David put his guitar down all the better to emote properly on Spalding Gray Can't Swim and to make sure we knew exactly what it was about Spalding that connects to us, a cool song.  The Star Standing was coated in a sparse beauty by Karel and Robert.
	<p />
Candy On The Cross took us back to the bad old good old days when Kings Cross was a 24/7 den of iniquity and Candy was an old before her time teenage heroin addicted prostitute plying her trade for the next fix on The Cally, as the current austerity really kicks in this song seems rather relevant and I wish that it didn't, a magnificent take on the despair that almost used to seem glamorous back then, only spoilt by the couple sprawled on the floor like a couple of 80's junkies who just couldn't shut up. At the end of the song and while he was tuning his Guitar before playing it again David took the time to tell them to shut up and the woman tried to talk her way out of it claiming they weren't being loud, something most of the rest of us disagreed with very quickly indeed and she eventually and finally managed to shut up so the gig could carry on.
	<p />
Which wasn't an ideal lead into them singing a song whose title is almost longer than they take to play it as David put it yes Missive To An Angel From The Halls Of Infamy And Allure will never be a song anyone shouts out for but what an great song none the less once the legless lady had shut the fuck up we could all hear it without any added babble.
	<p />
They then closed with a great version of his old Love And Rockets classic Dog End Of A Day Gone By that works really well with the Violin and piano as David's voice went nice and Deeply goth too that only left everyone cheering for some more.
	<p />
Of course they came back out and while David could have brought up several ex-band members for the encore we stayed with the trio to ask us Who Killed Mr Moonlight that I hope David will also be singing on Bauhaus' upcoming shows it was darkly magisterial and with the room glittering  it felt like the moonlight was in the room with us.  David then  put his guitar back down and they closed with It Was A Very Good Year that allowed David to give us his best Sinatra croon as Karel and Robert made it sound like your sitting in a restaurant in Prague as the house band effortlessly play the classics to entertain everyone. A great way to end a really good show.

	Very Thankfully Pat Fish is back playing live after having a bit of a scuffle with that cancer malarkey, thankfully so far Pat is winning and looked and sounded in good health at this Songwriters Three show put on by Aldhelm Primitive down in the basement of The Betsey Trotwood by the banks of the River Fleet. This is also now just over 30 years since Pat played his first solo shows rather than full band gigs with The Jazz Butcher. I was one of the people lucky enough to have seen the first 4 solo shows in two nights at Le Troupeau in Paris back in April of 1989 and the basement of The Bestey Trotwood is the closest venue in London to looking the same as Le Troupeau and this crowd was almost as enthusiastic as that French audience was all those years ago.
	<p />
	By the time I had stopped chatting to Pat outside and had got into the Basement Dave Sutherland was already halfway through his set. Dave started his career as both support for and driver and roadie for Bert Jansch and he was introducing Most Of the things We Are when I got in, the song is about Cancer and a friends fight against that awful disease, He had a really nice tone to his guitar playing and as you might expect with his pedigree he is firmly in the English folk troubadour tradition a very thoughtful and thought provoking song. 
	<p />
	The next song I heard was all about his years as Bert's driver and his journeys home after Dropping Bert off in north west London and going back to Deptford. Only From Vauxhall Tavern To The Deptford Broadway manages to conjure up quite beautiful imagery for a couple of not particularly beautiful parts of town, no matter how cool the Vauxhall Tavern can be on the right night I can't imagine many folk acts playing there.
	<p />
	He closed his set with Going Down To Georgia a great song about riding freight trains in the American South and he got a really good train rhythm going from his guitar to make us feel like we were riding those rails with him and of course while he was playing it we could hear an actual train going by on the Rail tracks that follow the course of the River Fleet just to add a nice touch of authenticity to it.
	<p />
	Next on was Matthew Edwards and one Unfortunate in the form of Craigus Andrew Barry on guitar for most of the set. Matthew is back from San Francisco for a short UK and French tour to continue the promotion for his latest album The Birmingham Poets which was also the first song they played with its sardonic references to his original hometown and the poets that emerged from there. 
	<p />
	Ungainly sounded anything but Ungainly with some lovely playing from both Matthew and Craigus really bringing the emotions in the song to life. By this point there was a fair amount of in-between song banter about Birmingham mainly and how Matthew now felt Beside Myself and well how he has a desire to tell the truth which of course isn't always easy.
	<p />
	After a little dig or two at Craigus for his Amish styling they did Folklore that certainly tells an interesting tale or two as Craigus tried not to drop all his plectrums while playing it. Then came Ghost from Matthews first album a song about his partner at the time leaving him pretty much in the middle of the night a real-life ghosting and quite a sad tale really.
	<p />
	Matthew then asked if anyone knew what California Can You Wait was about or could tell him afterwards, well it didn't sound like a song about wild fires and hollyweird paranoia but it could have easily been that, but I doubt it, to find out the truth you may have to buy Matthew a beer and ask him nicely about it.
	<p />
	The next song was kind of for all the Brummies in the audience including the promoter Guy Haslam as they played a pretty cool version of Birmingham before Craigus switched to Omnichord for the final song of the set Our Boldest Daughter and the sounds he got out of the omnichord made the song have a very Nick Drake sound to it and of course it's great watching what you have to do to play this early synth style instrument a great way to end a nice set.
	<p />
	After the break Pat Fish came on and sat down to play and after introducing the first song as being a new song realized he had no sound coming from the really cool Gretsch Electromatic he was playing, so once the amp had been taken off standby, Pat opened with a new song The Highest In The Land that takes aim at some of the people who seem to want to run our country it had a good sardonic take on the state of things.
	<p />
	Black Raoul was introduced as being a song about a tiger which may have exaggerated Raoul's breed a touch, but this was a very cool version with some lovely playing on that Gretsch. 
	<p />
	Pat then played the first cover in his set and apologized for playing covers at a songwriters show but when you've chosen to play a song as cool as Peter Blegvads Gold how could anyone complain and yes it really is the loneliest of metals a very cool version.
	<p />
	Pat then took us down to the Fishcoteque for a very cool version of Keeping The Curtains Closed which I'm sure more of us want to do these days than we may have once wanted too. He then reworked Shame About You a little bit into a wonderfully stark tale about his Lovely and where she may have gone.
	<p />
	Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers call to avoid ending up in the sunshine retirement home has a lot more poignancy both since his own illness and also from my own time spent visiting my mum in a similar home this song came close to reducing me to tears a beautiful version.
	<p />
	The intro to Melanie Hargreaves Fathers Jaguar explained how he got the song title from a conversation he had and it's a good story and of course a great song about cars getting torched that was followed by a really nice version of The Human Jungle that as ever made me smile.
	<p />
	Pat then played a song I requested while chatting to him outside as the first time I'd heard him singing about Elephants was at Le Troupeau 30 years ago and as ever I had to ask Pat to confirm the song is actually called Water rather than the Elephant song. Lets all make sure the Elephants can get a drink of water.
	<p />
	So how long has Pat had a thing for Shirley Maclaine well a lot longer than he's been singing this classic song for and it still sounds like a wonderful tribute. He then closed the set with a new song called Never Give Up that has a certain amount of wisdom in it in the fight to carry on and keep having a good life and it also managed to confuse me a bit with a chorus that goes "Well girl, it's not Condition Blue" but it's a great tune that really needs to be heard.
	<p />
	The rammed to the rafters crowd gave Pat the applause he deserved and he came back for an encore that was dedicated to all the musical heroes that have left us recently and he played a wonderful cover of Daniel Johnston's True Love Will Find You In The End that pretty much everyone sang along to that added a good bit of poignancy to this wonderful song.
	<p />
	Pat wasn't getting away with just one encore and soon had to come back for a second one that again got us all singing along this time to She's On Drugs and well these days who can blame her. Still no one wanted to leave and Pat had to play a third encore and finally gave into audience demand as two songs had been requested consistently through the set and no he didn't play Diamorphine but he did make sure lots of people were very happy to hear Love Kittens that had almost a choir like feel to the chorus as so many people joined in it was a great way to close another great solo set.

The Jazz Butcher is sort of a “he” and sort 
of a “they”. “He” is Pat Fish, a goofy sort of 
chap from Northampton, England, who 
never really expected to get famous. The 
“they” is because these days it’s not entirely 
clear whether “The Jazz Butcher” refers to 
just Mr. Fish, or to his whole band. 
<p />
The show on Saturday night didn’t look 
like a sellout, but there were plenty of people 
having fun. People like the two rather “confused” individuals who fell into the speakers 
in rapid succession! Most of the crowd was a 
bit better-behaved than that, though. 
<p />
The Jazz Butcher opened up with “New 
Invention”, from their latest record, Big 
Planet, Scary Planet. The next half hour of the 
show was entirely made up of songs from this 
LP and the previous record, Fishcoteque. 
This newer material received polite applause, 
but the audience didn’t get really excited 
until the band drifted into older territory, 
like “Big Saturday”, and ”Angels”. 
<p />
After the show, when | asked my friends, 
the consensus was “hmmm...... yeah, it was 
ok.” When pressed for details, they all 
seemed to agree that the older songs made 
the show. Songs like “Bicycle Kid” and “New 
Invention” were tight, but they didn’t have 
that special something that oozed out of the 
earlier songs. 
<p />
What we witnessed on Saturday night was 
basically a talent that is in serious creative 
trouble. It’s not just the self-indulgent noodling about with tape loops that we’ve seen on 
the last two albums. Nor is it the ultra-tight 
rhythm section, which has given the butcher 
a calm foundation in exchange for the 
crazoid mania they used to have. I think the 
problem is that they’ve tried, quite unsuccessfully, to become more sophisticated. There’s 
nothing wrong with progressing, but The 
Jazz Butcher seems to have moved from 
something they were good at, into a morass 
of directionless mediocrity. 
<p />
There’s nothing really wrong with songs 
like “Chickentown” and Bad Dream Lover,” 
but they just don’t have that mix of wit and 
poignancy that older songs had. At one time, 
the Jazz Butcher had something to say about 
going down to the pub, partying with a 
bunch of friends, getting drunk and silly, and 
using it all to disguise the fact that you’re 
dying inside. From the naive clarity of ”Partytime” to the wigged-out “Devil is my Friend”, 
their songs worked because they were sincere, and everyone could relate to them. But 
now the Jazz Butcher has grown up, travelled 
this big scary planet, and gotten swallowed 
by it. Perhaps they'll find some direction, but 
right now they’ve lost their roots, and can’t 
find anything concrete to stand on. 
<p />
Though it was a very tight set, the show just 
didn’t have enough energy or substance. 
Longtime fans heard enough of their old 
faves to keep them happy, but newcomers 
curious about The Jazz Butcher probably 
were a bit underwhelmed. They would have 
been better off spending the $13.25 on an 
earlier record, like Bloody Nonsense or 
Distressed Gentlefolk. Sure, everyone had 
fun, but Dinwoodie gets better shows for 
much less money.

	 ALSO: Read our Web <a href="${jbc_press}/interview_metrotimes_12Apr2000.html">exclusive interview</a> with Pat Fish of the Jazz Butcher.
	</div>

	<p /> The vexing thing about cult bands is that they're often famous
	only after they've broken up. Worse still, their sphere of influence
	on other musicians is much, much wider than their sales and influence
	on above-ground pop culture. Ergo, one of Britain's wittiest and
	stylistically adventurous songwriters, Pat Fish (aka the Jazz Butcher)
	is doubly damned.	<p />
	<p />First off, the cult of the
	Jazz Butcher and his nebulous group of co-conspirators includes two-thirds
	of Love & Rockets (or half of Bauhaus, if you prefer), Sonic Boom
	of Spaceman 3, members of the Blue Aeroplanes and countless closet musical
	romantics around the globe who have been saved by Fish's writerly
	wit and heartfelt pop music gemstones. Secondly, the bugger can't
	seem to break up the band or to stop making gorgeous records!	<p />
	<p />The trail of sidemen and cohorts
	is long and twisted, but when the Jazz Butcher rolls into town next Wednesday,
	it will be with the core group of musicians that comprised the Jazz Butcher
	Conspiracy, the band that first brought Fish's particular musical
	magic to public light and critical acclaim in the mid-'80s.	<p />
	<p />Ranging from the first records
	of folk-infused punk -  equally informed by the Velvet Underground,
	Jonathan Richman and Northern Soul -  to dissonant, feedback-enhanced,
	emotionally threadbare rawk, Fish has never left his musical or lyrical
	wit at the door. In fact, though the cast of characters in his orbit has
	changed, Butch's alternately heartbreaking and biting portraiture
	has been what keeps his bigger-than-you-would-imagine cult coming back
	like the quality-starved listeners they are.	<p />
	<p />There are few songwriters who
	imbue their songs with such a sense of place and populate them with memorable
	characters as acutely as Fish.	<p />
	<p />The Jazz Butcher is exactly
	that band you want to share with friends you know appreciate good beer
	(and lots of it) and who can stand still long enough to get swept away
	by genre-defying pop poetry. Not that Fish and friends have stood still
	that long. In fact, the band's trip back to the world of live performance
	is a journey touched with serendipity. And Fish obviously enjoys the "getting
	there is half the fun" pace he's set. As he says of his latest
	record deal with indie label Vinyl Japan:	<p />
	<p />"(Jazz Butcher guitarist
	and vocalist) Max (Eider) and I went down to have a chat with them. The
	chap said, `We'll give you a small advance, 500 pounds for recording
	and 2000 pounds for beer,' and we went, `Yep.'	<p />
	<p />"As the Butcher was splitting
	up in 1995, for the last few gigs, Max had been showing up (after a 10-year
	absence from the Jazz Butcher fold) and when we did our last gig we left
	it on sort of a half note," says Fish from his recording studio in
	Northampton, where he's wrapping up the new record.	<p />
	<p />"But in August `96
	a weird thing happened. Some guys down in Majorca wanted to book us and
	they didn't know we'd split up. We thought, hell, it's
	a trip to Majorca. And Max went along on that. So, when we finished that
	we thought, `There it is. Now we can stop.'"	<p />
	<p />That was before two ardent
	fans invited Eider and Fish to play at their wedding in Seattle with members
	of the Posies.	<p />
	<p />"That's what really
	got us back together," says Fish. "The joke is, it's their
	band, we just play in it."	<p />
	<p />Now, touring in support of
	the recently released live album <i>Glorious & Idiotic</i> (on ROIR
	records), Fish has to concede, "Well, I guess we're back, then,
	aren't we?"	<p />
	<p />But, for a band that, since
	1983, has let the public in on nearly a recording a year one way or the
	other, it's par for the journey.	<p />
	<p />And it all started (yet again)
	with an innocent vacation.	<p />

For his part, Fish will contribute elaborate, hand-drawn maps of nonexistent towns.

There's no such thing as "Alternative Radio" anymore. I see and hear
 local stations touting the likes of Jewel, Pearl Jam and U2 as
 "alternative"...but come on. If you have a Grammy on your mantle,
 you aren't the alternative to pop music...you are pop music. 10
 years ago, a band like the Goo Goo Dolls might have enjoyed alt-rock
 obscurity, but the public's taste has changed. I'm sorry, R.E.M...
 you're as big as Cher and there's nothing you can do about it.
	<p />
Still, a lot of immensely talented bands inhabit the fringe,
 yet never get their 3-4 minutes on "alternative" radio. Well,
 be fair, there can't be room for everybody. And if Santana qualifies
 as alternative, what hope does the little guy have for airplay?
	<p />
For too long, The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy has been overlooked
 and under-played. Though they may not have conquered the airwaves,
 they will have hi-jacked the 7th street entry for their own demented
 purposes on Sunday, April 23rd. Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher) and his
 ever changing line up of
 conspiritors have released, by my count, 10 albums, 13 singles,
 6 compilations and 3 live albums since their debut in 1983. In
 doing so, they have produced music that is thoughtful, poetic,
 political, funny, poignant, powerful and irreverant. They are
 as adept at wild, feedback driven guitar rock about war in the
 middle east, as they are acoustic ballads about talking elephants.
 Though deeply influenced by the Velvet Underground and Jonathon
 Richman, the Butcher has proven himself to be the king of his
 own particular rock idiom. His output defies classification,
 looting and pillaging every known musical genre. Their greatest
 "non-hits" are a stylistic smorgasbord. From the jazz laced "Partytime"
 to the rock-anthemic "She's On Drugs" to the ballad-y "Girl-Go",
 the only common thread is found in the Butcher's unique ironic
 sensibilities. Though critically acclaimed, and having a small but fanatical
 following that make trekkies seem aloof, the rock and roll pedestal
 they deserve seems just beyond their reach.
	<p />
And frankly, that's okay with them. Says Pat Fish "Personally I measure
 our success by how far away
 from home we have got. For the band I wish an unending supply
 of cash money. Not holding my breath, though. "The band, who tour the U.S.
 and Japan this spring, sees the recent
 return of original guitarist Max Eider and drummer Owen Jones,
 both of whom left the band in 1987. Max tells of the inspiration
 motivating a reunion after more than 10 years,"Boredom... and
 the fact that none of us had grown up and got lives. "
 Not to mention, "A trip to Majorca promoted by someone who didn't
 realize the group didn't exist. "Pat continues, "The unexpected foreign
 trips were so much fun
 that we simply became more open to the idea of playing live again.
 And our adoption of e-mail meant that it was suddenly much easier
 for us to find out where we were wanted and get there. "Playing live
 has led to an official reforming of the band, who
 retired in 1995.
<p />A performance in Hamburg, Germany last year
 was recently released as a live album, called "Glorious and Idiotic".
 The JBC has also been working on a brand new album, due out in
 June. How was it to go back into the studio together after all this
 time? "Not sober" Says Max, "Not tense. Like going home. Best
 time I've had in semi-rural Surrey so far this year. "Pat adds, "Perhaps
 `into the studio' is a bit misleading. The
 record was made with no professional input whatsoever, and is
 largely constructed from bits of string and stuff that we found
 in the garden. In terms of the new material, Max has contributed
 four absolute whoppers to the set. "The record also reflects what we've
 been listening to recently,
 Although I'm surprised at how `Jazz Butcher' it has come out.
 We're going to call it `Rotton Soul'. "Regardless of personnel changes or
 stylistic approach, the music
 has always come out sounding very `Jazz Butcher'. This is more
 than partially due to the very personal and observational lyrics.
 The Butcher has often likened their albums to postcards... documenting
 things as they are for the band at the time. So from what "place"
 is the latest postcard being sent?"semi-rural Surrey" jokes Max.
<p />"Many
 of the songs come from fairly dark and scary places, but
 we were having a good time when we recorded them, so it's kind
 of `bitter-sweet' I suppose. "What can we expect of the new album? Citing previous Butcher
 confections, Pat suggests, "Imagine a particle acceleration of
 `A Scandal in Bohemia', `Sex and Travel', and `Cult of the Basement'
 and I guess you'd be on the right road. "An inspired first step down that
 road would be seeing the band
 live. The dynamic of Pat Fish and Max Eider on stage is nothing
 short of bliss.

	<div class="iview_intro">
	When my father died of a heart attack in 1983, and I was called away to deal with family matters
	in Bradford, my then girlfriend marked the occasion by embarking on an affair with my best
	friend Dave, a student teacher from Essex. I haven't seen a great deal of Dave since then, but, a few
	months after all this happened, I heard that he had been thrown through a plate-glass window in
	Oxford by the Jazz Butcher, Pat Fish.
	<p />
	Their disagreement had nothing to do with my own difficulty, and I had never met Fish at that
	stage, but from that moment on, I found myself curiously drawn to his work. I now own every Jazz
	Butcher album, and I've seen the group countless times live, in many countries.
	<p />
	It's not quite the introduction to their music that I would have chosen, of course, and yet, looking
	back, the trauma seems almost worth it. One of the most talented and distinctive musicians Britain
	has ever produced, Fish's admirers include Michael Stipe of REM, and Teenage Fanclub. Largely
	unappreciated in the UK, his fans are overwhelmingly American: the Jazz Butcher has an
	especially devout following in LA, where the group still sells out the Roxy.
	<p />
	A couple of years ago, Roland Emmerich, the director of Independence Day and The Patriot,
	chartered a private jet in Cannes with the sole purpose of seeing the Jazz Butcher perform in
	Majorca. Pat Fish, says Alan McGee, the founder of Creation Records, is "as good a songwriter as I
	have heard in my life - ever. He has been criminally overlooked by a world obsessed with
	celebrity, not worth".
	<p />
	You don't need to get out your private Lear jet to see Patrick Fish most days - I travelled by
	Silverlink, out of King's Cross, to Northampton, where he lives in a small terraced house. Fish, an
	elegantly gaunt figure in his early forties, showed me into his small living-room. On his sofa,
	shrouded in smoke, is a middle-aged Turk called George. George is in a contemplative, almost
	visionary mood, and soon launches into a very strange monologue - basically a eulogy to British ale
	and the East Midlands. "That is how my young life was," says George. "Leicestershire lanes...
	wonderful, wonderful. Always more Ruddles... always more Leicestershire... Ruddles County...
	Ruddles bitter. Sometimes at room-temperature, sometimes cold. My God," he goes on, "the days
	I had there."
	<p />
	A silence.
	<p />
	"Ruddles," George says again, and sinks back into his cushions. We drink foreign lager for an hour
	or so, then my fellow-guest leaves.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	"George," Fish says, in a protective sort of tone, "is probably
	the most intelligent man I have ever met."
	</div>
	<p />
	In terms of orthodox possessions, there's not much here to show for 20 years of unique,
	exhilarating rock'n'roll, coloured by Fish's engaging irony and self-deprecating humour. He once
	wrote a song called "The Devil Is My Friend" (inspired by a pompous remark once made by a
	fellow-musician to an interviewer) that contained the lyrics: "I met the devil, he was sitting in a
	bar; he bought me 15 rum and cokes, and then he went too far."
	<p />
	His titles have been magnificent, both for his albums (A Scandal in Bohemia, Sex and Travel) and
	songs, which include "Mind Like a Playgroup", "Girls Say Yes", and "She's On Drugs". Cake City,
	a compilation of the Jazz Butcher's best work, is released in the UK next week, on Vinyl Japan.
	<p />
	Though he was tirelessly championed by the legendary west-coast DJ, ${deirdre}, who
	died earlier this year, Fish has been largely ignored by British presenters, with the notable
	exception of BBC's Andy Kershaw. Part of the problem, I suggest, may lie with the band's
	dreadful name. It started as a joke, says Fish, in a pub. The Jazz Butcher was an imaginary figure -
	a frighteningly virile vocalist, rarely troubled by self-doubt.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I was depressed," Fish says. "I'd just
	left college and moved to a Northamp- tonshire village. I shut myself away for a month and
	emerged with this tune about making love to dead people, called 'Zombie Love'."
	</div>
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher made his stage debut in 1982 with his long-term collaborator, guitarist Max
	Eider.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I came on singing '(I'm a) Sex Engine', Fish recalls, "to around 60 teenagers in a
	Northampton pub, feeling very, very scared."
	</div>
	<p />
	Pat Fish, whose real surname is the barely more plausible Huntrods, signed to Glass, a small
	independent label. The nucleus of the group - Fish, Max Eider and drummer Owen Jones, who are
	still in the band today - had met at Oxford University; hardly the most auspicious of rock'n'roll
	apprenticeships. In the early Eighties, the band - which then included David J, from the revered
	cult band Bauhaus - bonded with Mancunian punk legend and pugilist Mark E Smith, of the Fall.
	<p />
	This is one of the curious things about the Jazz Butcher group: their demure-sounding CVs offer
	little clue to their true instincts. A few years ago, the band's tour-bus was pulled off the M1 into a
	roadblock specially arranged by South Yorkshire police, who suspected that one of them was in
	possession of fire-arms (only replicas were recovered). If some of their songs sound like
	comfortable English whimsy, their typical live act is a bracing experience more reminiscent of
	Velvet Underground or the Clash.
	<p />
	The group returned to the UK last week, from the US. Their general feeling is that the American
	shows went well, not least because the tour did not culminate, as many have, in acrimonious
	disorder. Drink, Fish concedes, has played a pivotal role in shaping his career. If other bands have
	outdone them in terms of turnover, the Jazz Butcher, I suggest, can hold their own with anybody
	when it comes to musical differences.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"I don't know," says Fish. "I think we get on pretty well."
	</div>
	<p />
	My earlier interview with Max Eider included his memories of a night in Zürich, when the
	guitarist made one of his many spirited, but ill-fated, attempts to leave the band.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"Ah," Fish says.
	"Yes. Well, we did have a bit of a row there. Max was facing me across this large wooden table,
	piled high with empty bottles and glasses. He was furious. He told me he was leaving.
	<p />
	"We met for a beer the next morning," he continues, "and I said, 'Well, good luck. At least it
	didn't turn violent'." "Yes," Max said. "At least it didn't turn violent."
	<p />
	"I kept repeating that consoling phrase to myself when he'd gone, but then the fog of liquor began
	to clear, and I suddenly remembered Max lifting the table up and hurling it at me, with all the
	glassware, whoomph, in my chest. Still," Fish adds. "At least it didn't turn violent."
	</div>
	<p />
	A more recent tour ended with the singer having his face stitched up at a roadside shack in
	Valencia, follow-ing a collision with the machine heads of Max Eider's guitar. The only available
	anaesthetic was Smirnoff Blue. ("I had a rush of blood," Eider said. "I'd say it was more of an
	accident really. I have never attack-ed him knowingly.")
	<p />
	The Butcher spent the first half of the Nineties on Alan McGee's Creation label where, on albums
	such as Cult of the Basement and Big Planet, Scary Planet, Fish recorded many of his greatest
	songs, among them the magnificent ballad "Girl Go". Another song from that period, "Bicycle
	Kid", is a wonderfully observed study in high-rise angst. Like Morrissey, Ray Davies, and other
	interesting British songwriters, Fish has a strong sense of place - he's almost unbelievably besotted
	with Northampton - and he has embraced and celebrated the mundane details of urban life, not
	stood aloof from them.
	<p />
	There's been a kind of purity to the career of the Jazz Butcher group: Fish, Owen Jones and Eider
	have never married. None has children. None has a real job (though Jones, whose girlfriend lives in
	Hamburg, gardens for the novelist Günter Grass). Their healthy contempt for the forces of
	conservatism has survived undimmed, and in the studio, as in life, they passionately berate its
	various incarnations - Thatcher, Blair, Tesco and Railtrack.
	<p />
	Rotten Soul, their last studio album, released earlier this year, rages at the band's usual demons, but
	is a record made by men, not boys. Its climax is an eloquent, bold and very moving song called
	"Diamorphine", which Max Eider wrote immediately after the death of his mother. It's unlikely to
	be a summer dance hit.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"These days," Fish says, "we play totally for our own pleasure. The mad
	thing is that we all play much better than we used to. But somehow, we've never stopped thinking
	of ourselves as inept."
	</div>
	<p />
	He seems untroubled by the knowledge that many of his less- imaginative contemporaries have
	made fortunes as bankers, lawyers, or admen. "Fish," Alan McGee said, "is the sort of character
	that almost doesn't exist in Britain any more. Money or no money, he will always do what he does.
	But Pat Fish is a true star." By what definition?
	<p />
	"By the definition," McGee went on, "that he has written songs that stand up against anything. If
	Noel Gallagher had written 'Girl Go', it would have been a number one, no question. But you
	know what? Fish has written some of the great songs of the last 40 years and, sooner or later, great
	songs get remembered." The best possible future, he suggests, is that "somebody who loves him -
	somebody like Michael Stipe - will make a film and use one of Pat's songs, and it'll sell 14
	million."
	<p />
	As I'm getting ready to leave Fish's house, two young men - part-aspiring musicians, part-fans -
	knock at his door. He invites them in, even though it's nearly midnight, and pours them a drink. If
	he ever does strike it rich, this kind of relaxed accessibility will probably be the first thing to go.
	For the time being, though, there's no sign that Pat Fish, a man of huge originality, inventiveness
	and wit, is about to be visited by that far more suburban accomplishment, great fame.

	If you analyze this disc but just looking at the name, one would think that this band is either some
	far out jazz group that pushes the avant-garde limits or it is some punk rockers who embody
	everything that jazz is not. Lesson learned? Never judge a book by its cover. For one, this English
	quintet plays instruments such as accordions, kazoos, harmonicas and a good old Fender
	Stratocaster. The band uses these instruments to create a form alternative pop with a twangy blues
	touch. During the last 16 years, the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy has recorded over 11 albums which
	have delegated the band to a cult status. In 1999, the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy got together to play a
	gig in Hamburg, Germany and this disc is the result of that concert. The repertoire covers the
	JBC's entire career. The set opens with "Partytime" is a slow tempo that features Pat Fish playing
	a simple rhythm guitar and celebrating the best of times. Max Eider, who plays an rarely heard
	Gretsch Double Anniversary guitar, provides one of the finest solos that reminds the listener of
	simpler rock and roll times when Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley were kings. At the same time,
	there is a avant-garde balladeering aspect similar to Lou Reed, Jonathan Richman or Oren
	Bloedow.
	<p />
	In addition, there is humorous lyrical content with the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy: "You always act
	so stupid /You always talk so dumb/ But this is partytime /And you've got to say its better than a
	war /This is partytime /And its better than a cold bath with someone you dislike /This is partytime
	/And its good to drink for free when you haven't any money /This is partytime/ Oh, she might just
	possibly take me home." Along with the seventh song, "D.R.I.N.K", "Partytime" makes you want
	to grab a pint and get down with the band. These guys are like Billy Joel without the Long Island
	or Shane McGowan with good teeth. They bring the music down to a human level. For "Baby Its
	You", Mister Owen Jones and Pat Beirne pick up the accordion and harmonica respectively and the
	result is a beautiful love ballad. "The Human Jungle", one the performance's most upbeat tunes, is
	about the popular television program. It is not until, "Who Loves You Know" does a song
	remotely resemble a jazz song.
	<p />
	All of the songs have a stark simplicity to them. Simple rhythms, subtle guitar harmonies, well
	placed harmonica texture and fine three part harmonies. The emphasis is on a well-crafted retro
	pop song and if that is what you are looking for, the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy is the solution. It is
	disturbing that these guys have been stuck as an underground band for so long and that they have to
	go to Hamburg to get a crowd. Their music far surpasses anything that is heard today in pop,
	alternative, jam band or hip-hop circles. The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy keeps a dying genre alive
	and well ... the singer songwriter with a pop flare. If Chris Isaak can use the same formula and be
	popular, then these guys deserve even greater respect.

	Okay, now some details. An
	apparently-defunct band comes
	out of hiding to play a low-key
	club show with some old favorites
	and one or two new ones they've
	just written--and is so "pleasantly
	surprised" by the resultant
	recording that a live album is
	released documenting that special
	night.
	<p />
	If that's not a cliche these days, what is? All it's missing is the
	accompanying MTV special. Now forget all that simplistic
	coincidence, since it's not a bad bet that you don't have any old
	favorites by the Jazz Butcher. That's right, if the world didn't
	know a band was here, even with eighteen years and fifteen
	albums, can you really call it a comeback?
	<p />
	Well, there's some rabid pockets of people around the world
	who would call it just that, at least in a literal sense. The
	Glorious set resurrects some long out-of-print songs that
	cultists have been clamoring for lo these many years. For
	someone who's never seen the name or just never actually heard
	anything, these twelve originals can be old favorites in about an
	hour. For good measure, the perennial "Roadrunner" by
	Jonathan Richman's Modern Lovers caps it off.
	<p />
	Don't let the name throw you off if you're new to this group. It
	sounds right at home next to Throbbing Gristle and the
	Revolting Cocks. The Jazz Butcher himself (Pat Fish) is nothing
	of the kind. As the album progresses, the sound builds up from
	just two electric guitars (including some gorgeous hollow body
	work by Max Eider that Grant Green and Les Paul would envy),
	adding a bass, a harmonica, a brushed trap set and an accordion
	much like Talking Heads' "Stop Making Sense" routine.
	<p />
	The soft, jazzy duo songs grow to an infectious noise, not unlike
	Mr. Richman or, for that matter, the Velvet
	Underground--raw, old-fashioned rock played with both
	serious passion and relaxed humor. The album is encapsulated in
	two consecutive tracks. "Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present,"
	which sounds like Bo Diddley playing "Tequila," is horribly
	catchy and its "go go, go go gorilla!" refrain instantly burns
	itself in your brain and starts looping. If you can get past it
	without playing it again, you slide into "The Long Night
	Starts," the sort of tender, frank ballad Lou Reed excels at that
	speaks like an old friend, as you stare at the wall on Saturday
	night, the one you love occupied with someone else. Then the
	gears shift again into the cautionary tale of what happened to
	Bigfoot when he was attracted by the neon lights and checked
	into a Pacific Northwest motel.
	<p />
	The success of this date in Hamburg last February spurred the
	"live after death" JBC into a sold-out US tour, and another
	round of dates is starting up right now. Here's your primer, and
	you'll probably agree that a live appearance is not to be missed.

	<b>Willie's comments</b>: Before I begin phase
	two of these Jazz Butcher reviews (i.e., filling in all the gaps in his
	discography), I need to point out two things. One is that a lot of these
	albums are recorded under the name the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, but I'm not
	going to make the distinction between JBC and JB here, because there really
	is no measurable difference. Secondly, all of the missing fragments in my
	collection were provided to me by an insanely kind individual who goes by
	the name NameDotCom. One day, he e-mailed me out of the blue and asked if
	I'd like for him to make me copies of a lot of Butch's out-of-print material
	so that I could review it, and what should arrive in my mailbox this week
	but nearly the <I>entire Jazz Butcher discography</I>? I've been tirelessly
	searching for these albums for like five years, so imagine my euphoric delight
	at finding them all wrapped up in a nice little package, with colorful slim
	jewel cases. My gratitude toward NameDotCom is boundless, and all he asked
	in return for fulfilling my lifelong dreamis that I ask all of you
	JBC fans out there to please purchase these albums in a manner that will
	result in money actually getting into Butch's pockets, if possible. The label
	Vinyl Japan has recently started re-releasing some of the old stuff (<I>A
	Scandal in Bohemia</I> and <I>Distressed Gentlefolk</I>, as of this writing),
	and it's not only cheaper to buy the records directly from them as opposed
	to on eBay, but you'll be supporting one of the most talented British songwriters
	of the past twenty years.

	<p />
	Why didn't Vinyl Japan start their re-release campaign with the Butcher's
	first album, <I>In Bath of Bacon</I>, you ask? Well, presumably this is because
	they wanted to earn a little money from the first batch of re-releases in
	order to fund the next batch, and frankly, they probably wouldn't make a
	dime off this one. It's a magnificently stupid album. It opens with the cheesiest
	lounge-funk song you can imagine, with the Butcher (AKA Pat Fish, though
	that isn't his real name either) introducing each band member in the most
	obsequious manner possible: "Martin K. Daly, the Prime Minister of Funk."
	From there, things desend (or ascend, depending on your point of view) into
	smart-alecky songs about Bigfoot, food poisoning, zombies, how wonderful
	kittens are, and parties ("This is partytime, and it's better than a cold
	bath with someone you dislike").This jovial idiocy is all a put-on,
	though; it's belied by the thoughtful, subtle "Chinatown," a beautiful song
	that is carried by Fish's minimalistic flute playing and lyrics that evoke
	Cold War paranoia. Even if most of the other songs sound as though the lyrics
	were made up on the spot (the sexy "La Mer" is a song sung entirely in French
	that purports to be about the sea, but suddenly veers off onto the topic
	of elephants), there's a hilarious twinkle of intelligence behind it all,
	and the music is a lo-fi treat that melds Frank Zappa's more accessible
	indulgences with the twee carnival folk of Split Enz's early work. If you
	can find it, <I>In Bath of Bacon</I> is slight, immature, and just this side
	of brilliant. <B>Grade: B+</B>

	It should be noted
	at this point that the Jazz Butcher's music has nothing whatsoever to do
	with jazz. (To some, this will be a major selling point.)The "butcher"
	aspect is appropriate, however, since <I>A Scandal in Bohemia</I> finds the
	band chopping up various elements from rock history, walloping them with
	a surgical two-by-four, and stitching them back together in mutations that
	resemble some of the more whimsical creatures from the bad kid's bedroom
	in <I>Toy Story</I>."Soul Happy Hour," for example, borrows a few lines
	from "Money (That's What I Want)" and inserts them into an ingratiating doo-wop
	arrangement, all in the service of a drinking song. "My Desert" is a stirring,
	anthemic waltz that skewers the pomposity of stirring anthems (think the
	theme to John Wayne's <I>The Green Berets</I>), while "Caroline Wheeler's
	Birthday Present" is a drunken, stomping sort of proto-punk mess that
	inexplicably juxtaposes Alice Cooper and Jim Morrison with rotting fish and
	sausages. Even if I don't care for "I Need Meat" (which isn't due to the
	fact that I'm a vegetarian so much as the fact that I don't like rockabilly
	to begin with, and less so when the song's riff is constructed from the
	off-kilter opening to "These Boots are Made for Walking"), that's made up
	for by two of the great lost singles of the eighties: "Southern Mark Smith
	(Big Return)" and "Real Men." The former is an airy, straightforward pop
	song that has one of the best keyboard lines you'll ever hear, and the latter
	is a hilarious rant against bullying, beer commercial machismo ("They're
	stronger than a sheet of metal and they're in the rugby club reserves/Buy
	the wife a birthday kettle/These are real men getting on my nerves"). This
	would not have been possible on their previous album, but Fish, guitarist
	Max Eider, and the new, taut rhythm section of bassist David J. and drummer
	Owen Jones have miraculously evolved into a polished satirical unit. It's
	never as off-the-hook silly as Ween or anything, but the Jazz Butcher's droll
	brand of genre-splicing is every bit as accessibly clever. Check it out.

	This is a slapdash
	collection of singles and B-sides from the Butcher's first two albums. In
	anyone else's hands, such a bizarre collection of songs ("Water" is a cousin
	to Syd Barrett's "Effervescing Elephant," "Drink" is the precocious nephew
	of the Rat Pack's lounge-swing fetishes,"Jazz Butcher Meets Count Dracula"
	is the retarded half-brother of "Monster Mash") would give you a headache,
	but since <I>In Bath of Bacon</I> and <I>A Scandal in Bohemia</I> were cohesive
	albums only in their bratty <I>lack</I> of a linear style, <I>The Gift of
	Music</I> fits as perfectly into the Butcher's oeuvre as Tetris blocks. "Southern
	Mark Smith" has stupidly been reinvented as an annoying, bouncy popster,
	and the alternate version of "Marnie" withers in comparison to
	<I>Scandal</I>'s rendition, but they're mitigated by the new-and-improved
	"Zombie Love" and a killer cover of Johnathan Richman's "Roadrunner." Plus,
	"Jazz Butcher vs. the Prime Minister" has to be the most loony-yet-informed
	political rock song ever written (Fish threatens to literally consume good
	ol' Maggie Thatcher). There has never, to my knowledge, been a B-sides collection

	Two months after the
	release of <I>The Gift of Music</I>, the Butcher's third proper LP revealed
	a newly mature band- one who had learned how to temper their goofiness with
	a regretful sincerity (and who was still savvy enough to dilute the sincerity
	with goofiness), while still keeping the tunes front and center."Only
	a Rumour" is a terrific, introspective ballad about a nadir in a romantic
	relationship, and the mind-blowing Spaghetti Western epic "Walk with the
	Devil" expertly chronicles its bitter end. Less heavy but still just as subtle
	are "Down the Drain" (a cute Max Eider nursery rhyme) and "Holiday" (a parody
	of an uptight, "regular English-speaking gentleman on holiday" which lists
	his daily itinerary to a breathless, inflexible rhythm). In fact, only the
	jankly rave-up "Red Pets" is too knowing for its own good. Too short at only
	eight songs (I listened to the whole thing on the way to the video store
	and back), <I>Sex and Travel</I> nevertheless documents an important step
	in the Jazz Butcher's career: the one that lifted him above mere "novelty
	act" status and marked him as one of the great British zeitgeist photographers
	of the 1980s. <B>Grade: A-</B>

	You know, the Jazz
	Butcher might be pushing things a bit by this point. Just 13 months after
	<I>The Gift of Music</I> (and one month before the release of <I>Distressed
	Gentlefolk</I>) comes... another compilation! Six of these 14 songs were
	actually <I>on</I> <I>The Gift of Music</I>! So why bother with this one?
	Well, if you can't find any of the previous albums (and somehow magically
	come across this one), all of these songs <I>are</I> terrific, from the
	infectious "President Reagan's Birthday Present" to the invigoratingly sloppy
	"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present." Also, if you're a Butcher completist,
	five of these songs hadn't yet seen proper release on an LP, and confound
	it, they're essential: "Death Dentist" is a nifty ripoff of the <I>Peter
	Gunn</I> theme, "The Devil is My Friend" is a fun stab at Hank Williams,
	etc. If neither of those two <I>if</I>s above apply to you, though, leave
	this one be, because it's just mind-bogglingly <I>redundant</I>! Resist the
	urge to pick up everything that has the words "Jazz Butcher" on it just because

	While this album is
	not as consistently enjoyable as <I>Fishcotheque </I>or <I>A Scandal in

	in a hotel-lounge-bar-blues fashion, which effectively plays against the
	cynicism of songs like “Domestic Animal” and “Who Loves You
	Now?” And the songs that rock do so with a very particular, British
	wit: “Big Bad Thing” is rendered hilarious by its “Vut you
	vant?” shouts, while “Hungarian Love Song” is an amusing
	cannibalism number in the same vein as that Monty Python sketch where the
	sailors all insist that they be the ones eaten in case of trouble. Ballads
	“The New World” and “Angels” really go nowhere, however,

	Also known as <I>The
	Gift of Music volume 2</I>, <I>Big Questions</I> marks the Butcher's return
	to compilations that are actually worth picking up, instead of redundant
	cash-ins. With the exceptions of "Death Dentist" (which appeared on <I>Bloody
	Nonsense</I>) and an interminable, seven-minute version of "The Human Jungle"
	(from some versions of <I>Sex and Travel</I>), all of these songs were recorded
	and released in the year following <I>Distressed Gentlefolk</I> on various
	EPs. With snarky lyrical references to Brian Eno, the Soft Boys, and Peter
	Lorre (who gets his own infectiously stupid theme song), the better part
	of the album consists of intimate acoustic/synth songs performed solely by
	Fish and Eider. "Mersey," for example, is so despairing that it hardly matters
	that Fish is backed by a chintzy keyboard straight out of the song from <I>An
	American Tail</I>. From there, "Thing" is a brief snippet of heavily reverbed
	blues, "Rebecca Wants Her Bike Back" is another great buzzsaw rocker, "City
	of Night" is one of those perfect, ominous accordion numbers whose ethnic
	influences I can never put my finger on (these things always sound
	French-Italian-Greek to my ear), and the list goes on and on. These simple
	little songs prove that even a record full of what sound like the products

	After
	<I>Gentlefolk</I>, the Butcher's band parted ways with him, and he hooked
	up with a bunch of new musicians, who took the band in a more rocking, less
	divergent direction.With shimmering guitars reminiscent of the Cocteau
	Twins (in tone only), a plain British singing voice reminiscent of Robyn
	Hitchcock, and hilariously smart/smarmy lyrics reminiscent of everyone from
	Kurt Vonnegut to Neil Finn, The Jazz Butcher, on this album, crafts some
	of the best dang rock songs I've ever heard. On <I>Fishcotheque</I>, there's
	a brilliant nonsense rap about chickens (sample lyric: "Chicken on holiday/
	Chicken in jail/ You wake up in the morning, there's chicken in the mail"),
	a seductive pop song about divorce ("Get It Wrong"), and nine other slices
	of genius. This is actually a good place to start, if you can find it.

	This album leans more

	some of the Butcher's most pointed non-sequitur lyrics (most evident on
	"Nightmare Being": "I'm invisible, like salmonella"). "Line of Death" is
	a Middle Eastern rave-up that incorporates elements from <I>Deliverance</I>

	<I>Cult of the Basement

	ballad-centric than, say, <I>Big Planet Scarey Planet</I>, but "Sister Death"
	and "Pineapple Tuesday" are two of the best ballads in musical history. "The
	Basement" is a wonderful surf-rock instrumental, and "Mr. Odd" is pure pop
	ecstasy (and there's a "Space Oddity" reference, too!). And "My Zeppelin"
	is just weirdness that involves Steffi Graf for no particular reason. <I>Cult

	Apparently, this is
	an album that was made after a lot of personal pain and anguish for Butch.
	That might explain the lack of effort that was apparently put into the album-
	there are only nine songs, and one of them ("Monkeyface") is practically
	the exact same song as "The Basement" from the previous album, only with
	different samples layered overtop of it. However, the eight new songs are
	mostly pretty good (if overlong). They're mostly poppy tunes of the sort
	found on <I>Fishcotheque</I>, only with a slightly darker edge to songs like
	"Honey" and "Racheland." It's not my favorite album, but as the <I>Trouser

	After a lengthy
	hiatus, Butch reunited with estranged sideman Max Eider and put out this
	album on the Vinyl Japan label. As Eider writes in his witty liner notes,
	"We have nothing but good to say of Vinyl Japan, but I'm sure they won't
	mind my pointing out that [this album has] been made on the cheap." This
	is a bit of an understatement. <I>Rotten Soul</I> features the cheapest drum
	machine this side of Trio and a total lack of production (one example: the
	opening verse of Eider's "The One You Adore" is marred by the piercing line
	noise from a guitar whose part hasn't started yet). This has the unfortunate
	effect of making the subdued songs which make up a large portion of <I>Rotten
	Soul</I> sound as though they were performed by an above-average karaoke
	band. Sometimes Butch manages to transcend his budgetary limitations: the
	buff "Tough Priest" transcends the lo-fi nature of the proceedings by means
	of a killer hook and the Butcher's use of an ominous Irish accent. "Mr. Siberia"
	works with the cheapness of the sounds to produce a terrific slice of slow
	funk, but those are the only two songs that measure up to the standard set
	by <I>Fishcotheque</I> and <I>Big Planet Scarey Planet</I>. Some songs sound
	like mere demos ("Big Cats"), and some just sound <I>sad</I> (the ill-advised
	country ballad "Sleepwalking"). Mr. Eider himself is another problem. His
	leisurely songwriting style has never really meshed with the Butcher's
	aggressiveness, and while his tunes are a vast improvement on the Jimmy Buffett
	margarita-rock formula, they pale in comparison to Butch's. (Parrotheads
	would do well to seek out Eider's well-meaning solo album <I>The Best Kisser
	in the World</I>, however.) There's simply not enough joy to be had here,
	I'm afraid. It's a disappointing comeback. <B>Grade: C</B>

	I'm a longtime fan of the Jazz Butcher. I've enjoyed his sensitive-
	wiseass lyrics through a number of musical styles ranging from cocktail
	jazz through jangle-pop to fuzzbox freakouts. His last few albums have
	been more consistent in style, mainly an increasingly drony rock sound.
	They've also been increasingly disappointing to me; his last album, "Cult
	of the Basement", has a few great songs amidst a lot that I can't even
	remember.
	<p />

	With "Condition Blue", though, the Butcher has made a major comeback.
	He's continued to explore the droning guitar sounds, but coupled that
	with some of the catchiest songs he's written in years, and increased
	contributions from longtime associate Alex Green on sax. There's a
	consistent <i>texture</i> to this album more than a consistent <i>sound</i> --
	the Bo Diddley beat and goofy lyrics of "Shirley Maclaine" ("I've had
	a thing about Shirley Maclaine since I was so high") is a long way from
	the moody ballad "Racheland" ("these are the hardest times"), yet they
	don't seem out of place next to one another.
	<p />

	The lyrics convey a sense of detachment, like they're coming to us
	from a long way away. Combined with the droning sounds and long
	songs -- over 6 minutes each on average -- the overall effect is of
	an album that washes over you in the way some of the so-called
	"shoegazer" albums do -- not that this has much in common with My
	Bloody Valentine beyond that. In spite of that detached feeling,
	this is a curiously affecting album, and my favorite from the Butcher
	since "Fishcotheque".

	of a house inhabited by a Leeds based 4 piece band called Saab

	<p />
	<b>Where and when did you two meet and how did you come together
	as a musical partnership?</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Can I answer that?
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> You certainly can.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Cos I remember it really well, cos like we was at college
	together but before he came to college, which would make it the
	summer of 1977 I reckon.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yes it would.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> The summer of 1977, me and my mate John Silver who I was
	in a group with went to a pub in Wimbledon where John lived,
	on the common and it was getting on about half past ten at night,
	it was dark and it was summer and we were outside and John just
	introduced me to Max at that point. He said
	"oh, this is a bloke I used to go to school with and he's a bit of a musician
	blah de blah" and we met.
	<p />
	Seconds after that John Silver sat down on Wimbledon Common in
	a huge dog turd... (laughs from all) and as he got up he issued
	a line that I've never forgotten, he just went
	"Well I used to love it, but its all over me"
	and that's, as far as I'm aware the first night we met.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> You could well be right, I've absolutely no recollection of that.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> It's before you came up to college... (adopts upper class speech-Ed)
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Hmm, hmm
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yes, yes just a young whipper snapper from sarf London... (adopts
	mock cockney accent-Ed)
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, college, college.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yeah, that's when we got to know each other.
	<p />
	<b>
	${bacon}... (debut album) was put together
	were you both in employment, or were both still at college?
	when did you turn professional?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> ha, ha (breaks into fits of laughter-Ed)
	(Interrupts)
	<p />
	<b>
	if that's the right word.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> You've heard the record!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> I never consciously turned professional.
	Made a living from it then.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> There have been times when it's been my main source of income. But err it's
	a very different thing really (light laughter from all-Ed)
	I was just so seriously broke after we left university Pat disappeared
	up to Northampton and I was still living near Oxford and he wrote
	these songs for the Bath of Bacon LP.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> But I can remember, I had a job at a Lawyers in Northampton
	and it was too expensive for the real lawyers to go to London
	to do the court cases cos their time costs the earth right, so
	they used to send fuckwit instead and I can remember in the summer
	of '82 you (points to Max) were definitely in London because I can
	remember meeting up with you going down to them cases and that
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Oh, right, I must have gone back to London by then?
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> He was in Fulham weren't you?
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Errrrr, West Kensington, no Fulham, Fulham your absolutely
	right, I don't think there is much point talking to me because I can't
	fucking (fits of laughter from all-Ed) remember a single fucking
	thing about it, and this is what our conversations are like.
	When we have these conversations, he says
	"no, no you weren't doing that, you were doing that," he's always right.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> And yet he won't listen to me when I suggest something like,
	"oh you don't wanna do that, you wanna do that"
	he won't listen but he's quite right, but yeah, you had all kinds of jobs. You were
	working at City Bank for a while you were running the Sudan for
	a while if I remember rightly?.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> That's right.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Here's this bloke in off the street, out of fucking college and this
	big American Bank have got him like running the Sudan, I was
	well impressed, all I ever got was trying to shut down dodgy
	companies who ripped everybody off!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> They defaulted though, Sudan after about six months.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> You should have sent them to me mate, I'd have sorted them out, ah
	you should have sent them to me.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> That was the end of my banking career.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I'd have sent the bailiffs round mate,
	see that pile of earth?, we're having that
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Poor old fucking Sudan.
	<p />
	<b>So how did you manage to scoop a (relatively) famous
	person to drum on your first single?</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> You mean Elvis?
	yeah well, we sort of oh! You mean Kevin (Haskins)
	<p />
	<b>
	I guess Peter (Murphy) and to a lesser degree Daniel(Ash)
	were more famous than David (J) and Kevin at that point but I
	guess it was still a big scoop, was it?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> It just sort of happened really, Kev would hang around.
	When I got up to Northampton you know it's not a big town.
	<p />
	<b>
	The point I was trying to make was, him (Kevin),
	and later David's (J) involvement probably brought you a wider audience would
	that be fair?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I think especially Dave, yeah, I think when Dave joined
	we didn't really notice cos we'd got used to him, he was already around and like me & Max had
	done gigs opening for him and got to know him a little bit, been
	round his house that sort of thing and he was... and then there
	was like a period after that little tour at the end of
	'83 Dave was out with Steve Musgrove on bass and we doing the
	opening act and initially all that happened out of that was that
	we nicked Steve Musgrove to play bass for us and that went on
	for about three months and in a move that still leaves me gasping,
	I don't quite understand what happened, Dave replaced his nicked bass
	player and got him kicked out of the JBC (Jazz Butcher Conspiracy-
	as the band later became known) and he came in instead and we
	just used him. You know he was just a mate and he was around.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Then he turned up at your house and demanded to join the
	band basically.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> It wasn't that far off yeah, I mean he's done this, you were not the only band
	he's ever done this to, those lads down in Brighton called errrm..
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> But he was at a loose end at the time.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well yes, Bauhaus had just gone belly up and like he didn't know what to do.
	<p />
	<b>
	It seemed like the JBC had become a refuge for ex-Bauhaus
	members?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I think what was going on was by the end of Bauhaus they
	probably weren't enjoying themselves very much and they saw these young blokes
	with no money who were having a laugh and they thought
	"is that done?"
	so they probably just.. they were just social you know we were just around, and yeah
	we were totally used to Dave by the time he came in the group
	you know it was a bit good, oh! Look we got a proper bass player
	now but it didn't really dawn on us like what other people had noticed, you know
	but then yeah you'd start seeing like Smash Hits going like Bauhaus bloke Dave
	J has joined this group, so yeah there's no doubt it did us some good, no doubt at all.
	<p />
	<b>
	How did the Glass deal come about?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> 12th of June 1982!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> He's like a computer!
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> We played our first gig at The Black Lion (Northampton -Ed)
	supporting a band called "Where's Lisa?" and after that gig Dave Barker showed up and we knew Barker
	already. We'd known him a little bit in the band we were in before with this
	John Silver character, I think we'd stumbled across him you know how bands are trying to get a
	deal, and just stayed friendly with him and he, this band "Where's Lisa?" were one of his bands, he was putting their records out
	and we supported them and errm straight after the gig
	"errm I'm coming to sign you"
	(adopts Dave Barker speak) that was that really so first gig
	and signed a contract all in the same night. So I'm looking forward to June 12 this year cos it's the 20th anniversary.
	<p />
	<b>
	Glass seemed pretty errm, looking back now, unusual
	in the way that it let you release material that would normally
	not be used, like for instance the live tapes that were for sale
	through the fan club, licensing exclusive material to magazines
	like Zig- Zag and the 17 thing ("What a nice way to turn seventeen"
	a fanzine type magazine that issued a 7
	hard vinyl single featuring The Jazz Butcher's take on John Cale's The Chinese Envoy)
	This type of promotion was quite unusual then.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well you see Glass was not really any better than the groups
	on it, so anything you can do to sort of get in with another
	scene, get spotted
	<p />
	<b>
	So that's what it was all for?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I think so yeah, I think they were just doing what self
	promotion he could, and honestly looking back you know, taking
	the JBC from the Black Lion in Northampton to the fucking Roxy
	in L.A. he didn't do a bad job did he?, for an unlikely bloke from Romford!
	<p />
	(laughs-all)
	You know if Glass had had like some twat who knew business there,
	cos all Dave knew was like music and Dave's old job, he used to work at Polygram doing the sleeves and
	I swear to God he started putting out albums just so he could
	do the sleeves, I swear to God and he had a band as well so that
	had something to so with it. But really I mean Dave just
	yeah its amazing what he achieved.
	<p />
	<b>
	Would you consider the
	84 Scandal line up as the first
	solid
	version of the band?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b> Both:</b> yes
	<p />
	<b>
	Within two years then, David (J) had gone, Felix
	(David's replacement) had gone and the year after that you had gone (Max)
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> He had to go (Felix)
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> He had to go (Felix)
	<p />
	<b>
	Come on then lets have it!
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well, its all about bathrooms Andy, its all about bathrooms.
	It was just like, I've never known a bloke like it, like you
	know you're not a rich band, you tour, you share rooms and you
	rotate and the reason you rotate more than anything is that no-one
	gets stuck with Graham - Felix is Graham.
	<p />
	Cos, like good bass player but in all other respects it was like
	having a stranger on the bus and where it really got bad was
	with the bathroom. He would disappear into the bathroom. Perhaps
	two and a half hours before the soundcheck and you'd go in
	after, your eyes would be watering, man there'd be like
	cosmetics everywhere and everything had been like thoroughly
	steamed - and like that was it basically. If you saw Graham move into the
	bathroom then you could just give up all bodily functions for
	the next couple of hours and it wore us down. There are other
	weird things. Once, in France I said to him shall we play D.R.I.N.K
	tonight and he said
	"ah, D.R.I.N.K, I don't think I know that one"
	which was alarming to me because we'd done it in Hamburg about three weeks before. He was a sod,
	he was a perfectly good bass player and I think we were probably
	quite good for him as well, I think he got better but he just
	wasn't around, and like it really got bad on the American tour in
	'86 it was like
	<p />
	<b>
	Did he leave or was he
	asked to leave?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yeah, he left.
	<p />
	<b>
	Was he persuaded?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> errm, no, I's obviously a very sensitive man.
	<p />
	Max: (laughing) not that fucking sensitive.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> We were gonna boot him out, somehow on the last day in L.A
	when there were no more gigs to do, somehow his antenna's got it and he come and said
	look Pat, I gotta leave - so it was all sort of ... (makes gesture)
	<p />
	Two years later I run into him in a night club and he comes up
	me and goes "Hey Pat how you doing?, alright mate?, you know
	that Sex and Travel" ... yeah..."Sex and Travel; that means fuck
	off don't it.. (Max begins giddy laughter at this point-Ed)
	.. so I goes "yes Graham" and he goes... you think he aint gone far
	enough yet... don't you but no, dear god almighty... "does that
	mean fuck off ? "yes Graham it does.." "so like in a way that
	was like you and Max telling David to fuck off (all laugh)... do
	you know what I mean?... where do you start!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> He was an odd chap.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Where do you start?
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah..
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Not a dangerous bone in his body, not a bad man but...
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No, he was a nice enough guy but not a kindred spirit really,
	so it was a bit odd being on the bus with him for five weeks.
	<p />
	<b>
	Speaking of the bus, why did you jump off Max?
	</b>
	<p />
	Max: (laughing) We had an absolutely spectacular drunken row,
	drinking whiskey, actually I'm drinking whiskey tonight... it
	was a dreadful... errr
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Switzerland.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> A dreadful gig wasn't it?
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> The opening of a night club and they just wanted a group
	because you have to have a group and everyone was just drinking
	Champagne and ignoring it..There's a tape! there's a tape!,
	fuck knows who's got it but I heard it one night, I couldn't
	believe it, you know an hour before the bust up right and Zombie
	Love starts and you (Max) go to the microphone, you go "right
	fuckers have some of this" (everyone erupts with laughter-Ed)

	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> I must have been drunk, that's part of the trouble, it's
	quite a late, quite a late gig and a really weird one, we'd been
	doing it very heavily before.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> ... and they fed us shit!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> ... and they fed us shit!
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I think this is the root of our whole falling out and basically
	we were totally under nourished, we were wild on scotch, we were
	both pissed off about pretty much the same things but for dinner... there
	was snow on the ground outside, it's Switzerland, it's winter
	and there was snow about this deep on the floor (makes depth
	gesture with his hand-Ed) outside and for dinner they gave us
	this piece of mozzarella cheese with a slice of tomato on top!
	"vegetarian ya?" (in mock Swiss accent)
	(all laugh)
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> We were drinking like mad on that tour just going a bit
	mad and you know it (laughing) just got a bit too much.
	<p />
	<b>
	Glad to be back?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, we're having a great time I really am enjoying myself,
	I mean we sort of got back together personally quite a long time
	before we started doing this again.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Cos, yeah I mean there was still a Jazz Butcher band going
	and like we just sort of got back together as mates but like
	that band was still going with Dooj and Hendo and all that, pretty
	much as soon as we called it a day with that I think it was within
	a year I got that thing "oh! do you wanna go and play Majorca?,
	they don't know you split up" and it was the first phone number
	a reached for, I just thought ... well.
	<p />
	<b>
	That was August 20 wasn't it?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> It was certainly August.
	<p />
	<b>
	I remember cos it was my birthday (the date of the
	gig) when you said you and Max had got back together and it was
	like, the first show, I remembered it because of that date, so
	that would have been the one.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yeah.
	<p />
	<b>
	You told me in a letter or something that you hooked
	back up with Max again...
	..... So "Distressed Gentlefolk" was the last Jazz Butcher album
	(compilations aside) that Glass Records put out, did the label
	fold?, was that the reason you moved, or did you leave?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> What happened was, I still feel a bit naughty about this
	cos I sort of feel if we'd stuck around maybe the label wouldn't
	have folded, but Dave (Barker), cos he'd had success with us
	to a degree and he'd got a Pastels album out and he'd got a few
	names...
	<p />
	<b>
	Spacemen Three...
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yes, he'd got Spacemen, he'd got Perfect Disasters, well...
	is it really wanky for me to say why he got Spacemen and Perfect
	Disaster (laughs)
	<p />
	<b>
	Yeah (laughs)
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yes (laughing) but it's true!, but he fucking..and he legged
	Loop, he only had a staff of one in the office and that was Josh
	(Hampson) who formed Loop..."errr he's just pissing about (In
	mock Barker accent-ed) and he let that one slip through his fingers
	and that was in the office, but he generally got it right.
	<p />
	What happened was, after the bust up I fucked off to New York
	for a bit with my Mrs and I got a phone call about 25 January
	"Pat do you know you're supposed to be playing a gig" ? - it
	was Mike Hink my agent " you know you're supposed to be playing
	a gig in Bergen in Norway on the 28th"?.... I'm like, "no, Mike
	this is news, you know there's no band"
	<p />
	"Well, yeah, but..." and what it was, he'd carried on booking
	that '86 tour right through into fucking '87 and so me and Alex
	(Green - veteran of David J solo albums and one time Sinister
	Duck-Ed) went and just did a load of rubbish but that was completely
	out of the blue, that was completely unexpected... why did I get
	onto that?
	(everyone agrees that no-one knows! -Ed)
	<p />
	<b>
	The original question was what happened to Glass?...
	</b>

	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Thats right! (Max is in fits of laughter at this point-Ed)

	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Thats right!
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> This is really good, sometimes... got part of the conversation
	written down....
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yeah, that's very good when you smoke as much dope as me!.
	There's little wheels and big wheels, they all meet up in the
	end... but on this tour we got as far as Paris and by now me and
	Alex had got something of an act, which basically <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1987/Feb10.html">in Paris consisted</a>
	of playing La Mer (from Bath of Bacon) I kid you not six times,
	they wouldn't let us not play it and at the end of that Paris
	gig I went up to the dressing room and I was very excited because
	I'd heard there was a young woman there that I liked, English
	woman and I was quite excited, but before that happened Alan McGee
	appeared and I said "what the fuck you doing here"?. Cos I hadn't
	seen him for years since he used to do a sort of Living Room
	(the London club owned by McGee-ed) and (adopts thick scotch-McGee
	type accent) "I've come to sign you, you're out of contract with
	Glass" and I'm like "Oh! am I?" cos you see I hadn't noticed,
	cos I'd been doing these silly gigs in fucking Norway & shit..
	errm, McGee had fucking spotted it and said "look I've come to
	get you" he said "There's three I've always wanted; Lawrence
	out of Felt, Copey and yourself " and so I said "well yeah! alright",
	I was flattered and I thought, wrongly, as it goes that Creation
	would get us more exposure, they in fact.... Dave (Barker), considering
	where we started from always did a better job. Alan was like
	"I'll double your sales (in scotch accent-ed). But what he didn't
	understand was, we had an international operation and right to
	it's dying day Creation never had a foreign office, they never
	had an expert who could deal with abroad, he increased our sales
	with Fishcoteque (Creation's first Jazz Butcher release and arguably
	the best JBC album-ed) but after that...
	<p />
	<b>
	Who owns the rights to the Glass catalogue now?
	</b>

	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> errm... infamously the rights to the JBC back catalogue were
	bought / sold by Dave Barker I fondly imagine in a car park outside
	a pub in Dagenham. Two and a half thousand quid- that's four
	LP's, eight singles, two and a half thousand quid - the lot

	and he sold them to Clive Simmons of Fire (Records-ed)

	<p />
	<b>
	You have answered the next question, it was how did
	the Creation deal come about?... we'll move on.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yes, that's how I saw it, I didn't really see Glass go under
	cos I was abroad.
	<p />
	<b>
	I assume that's what happened then - folded?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yes, just ran out of money, Dave got quite ambitious he
	started putting out records left, right and centre in '86.
	<p />
	<b>
	So where were you during the JBC's Creation years Max?
	</b>

	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> errm... in London, I played with David, David J on a couple
	of albums, did a couple of tours with him, you know, apart from
	that just sort of working being bored (laughs)
	<p /><b>
	Working at what?, what were you doing?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> I errr...
	<p /><b>
	Within music you mean ?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No, no I sort of edit stuff for broadcasters...
	<p /><b>
	For T.V, radio?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No it's just like booklets and web sites.
	<p /><b>
	And do you still do that?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah (Pat leaves the room to get a beer at this point, a
	request for one is made by Max) yes, I mean I did do, you
	know I was still writing stuff and errm... and did the occasional
	gig on my own, didn't make any money (laughing)
	<p /><b>
	There are some great songs on The Best Kisser in the
	World (Max's first album), I particularly like the line in Raking
	Up Leaves about "Jesus, friend of the poor..."
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Pat likes that.
	<p /><b>
	Did the album sell?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No, no it didn't sell, it's partly because, well one of
	the reasons is that the record company went bankrupt shortly
	after releasing the record, not directly...
	<p /><b>
	Was that put out through BMG?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> They had distribution through BMG the company was called
	Bigtime.
	<p /><b>
	American?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, well the guy was Canadian but the company was based
	in America, they had the Jazz Butcher licenses for the Glass
	records, that's how I got to that. It kind of just went down
	the tubes that record but a few copies got out and around and
	it's amazed me over the years...
	<p /><b>
	Well I bought one! its like I said to you earlier its
	been one of those albums that I've been waiting for a CD re-issue
	for... what was it '86, '87 or something like that was it?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> '87 yes
	<p /><b>
	I was gonna do my own copy of the disc from my original
	vinyl, but then I saw that Vinyl Japan had put it out so I thought
	no I won't, I'll get that one.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Good man!
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> You're the kind of person that keeps us in Cheese sandwiches
	my friend! (laughing-all) Downloading it all now you know!...

	<p /><b>
	Vinyl Japan have put out three re-issues recently (Scandal
	in Bohemia, Distressed Gentlefolk and the excellent compilation
	Cake City), were you involved in them putting your album out?,
	were you signed to them or was it done on the back of the Jazz
	Butcher thing?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No, no they just offered, they just said "do you wanna do
	another solo record?" I thought I probably did! (laughing)*

	<p /><b>
	Influences then and now, obviously there is the Lou
	Reed, John Cale, Kevin Ayres and Jonathan Richman songs amongst
	others that you have covered over the years, were they necessarily
	influences or did you just like the songs?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> JoJo's (Richman) songs one tends to do em because they are
	easy to play, I feel that like the very obvious Velvets influence
	on him and on us, I feel it's more in common, I don't feel he
	particularly influences what we're about.. errm... John Cale doesn't
	really except to the extent of that kind of like "Clever Hostility"
	(adopts Cale's Welsh accent-ed) you know that one aims for and
	so rarely achieves. But yeah... Eno was a big influence when we
	kicked off I remember, I was listening to the ..you know the
	Eno records where he sings.
	<p /><b>
	Right...
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> errm..that are all a bit clattery and everything is wrong
	sounding and it's almost like... its '74 and it's like half way
	between the Velvets and Punk, twice as inventive as both in some
	ways, I used to love those, it's one of the reasons we used to
	have stupid instruments a lot and stuff like that, I just used
	to hear him and think why?... right get all the toys out the box
	you know... I just bought Tiger Mountain again on CD the other
	day so now as well for me.
	<p /><b>
	Do you neighbours still think you're a weirdo?
	</b>
	<p />
	Max: (laughing) I would have thought so..
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> I had these really costy neighbours, they didn't think I
	was a weirdo, er "my best mate Pat, don't hit me" (adopts strange
	drunken accent-ed) they were sweet. I used to think they got
	on Ketamin you know that horse tranquilliser that costy's enjoy!
	(laughing) I thought they used to get on Ketamin but I was wrong
	what they were actually doing was going on epic drunks, the like
	of which the JBC have never seen. I spoke to a man who had been
	in their kitchen on a Monday morning after like a whole weekend
	of all night techno & pissing it up and there was still vodka
	in the fridge Monday morning. But like only because there had
	been so many..so they were nice, but we got Kosovo Albanians
	now so, yeah they probably think I'm pretty weird yeah! (laughing)...
	come on I'd stick out like a sore thumb in Albania wouldn't I?

	<p /><b>
	When you played the shows in 2000, when you (Max) joined
	back up with Pat and Owen (Jones- Drummer in the first solid
	line up of the JBC in '84) joined up, did that feel like the
	JBC was back together where they belong or was it just a bunch
	of old mates having a laugh ?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Bit of both really.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yes, it was a bit of both, it was certainly one of the best
	of all the tours I've done that was the second most fun I've
	had.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Which one was that, that 2000 one in America?
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, I'm talking... the long one we did.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Yeah, with Dave and the guys, yeah the east coast one, yeah
	we did have some fun on that actually..yeah. I had a bit of a
	panic attack on that one, but I... I liked best..my favourite
	of all the tours since we got back together, in fact you know
	me and Max have been doing this since '99... nine nine ninety
	nine... we went over to play in L.A and we had Dave (J) and Kev
	(Haskins) with... and the next day, no the the day after, eleven
	September '99 the Valentine Bomber arrived... the boy Steve, the
	American Taliban himself. He's just, he's a genius I just love
	him and errm... I must say his first gig in San Francisco he
	wasn't that clever but he's got really clever, and that for me..yeah
	when we went on tour the next.. I guess he was fully established
	alright but I still really enjoyed that '99 tour up the west
	coast. I'm just happier up the west coast these days.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> I think that's probably the one I mean actually (all laughs)

	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Fantastic.
	<p />
	Max: (Still in fits of laughter) oh Jesus, the other one.. we
	did a lot of shit like Iowa, no-one turning up at all.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> No we were like doing some really pointless gigs cos, like
	what we'd try to say ever since Majorca is... alright.... we sort
	of exist we're not like competing or anything but yeah we're
	there. But we only wanna go and play in places where someone
	asks us specifically to come so we know it will be a pleasant
	day out, but our mate in New York, David, got a bit carried away
	and although he got us loads of fantastic pleasant gigs he also
	threw in three or four which I guess he thought would make money
	but they were in places where the Jazz Butcher has never played.
	Didn't play last time and aint playing this time.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Wont play again.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> No, we played in Iowa City to eleven people and one of those
	people had driven 350 miles and was on acid and the other 10
	couldn't give a fuck except that he wouldn't stop talking to
	them. He was so exited and he was on acid and he was just raving,
	he gave me some acid but I never took em.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Well they obviously worked!
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Ain't you glad I didn't take those talky acids!..cos if
	it had worked on me like it worked on him..Christ!
	<p /><b>
	How big were you?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Six foot four!... what do you mean in America or what..?

	<p /><b>
	No, not necessarily America but Germany, Holland... you
	seemed to tour pretty extensively during the mid to late 80's..
	</b>

	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well yeah, we were... certainly I don't know how the others
	felt really but I was really keen to just be like a live gigging
	band because I like the lifestyle.
	<p /><b>
	What sort of audience size would you... compared to the
	UK say? Particularly in... probably Hamburg?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well you know there's weird things, I mean in 1986 we played
	in Reading to 750 people, and like London, Jazz Butcher would
	regularly get like 500 plus, and if we'd go to Hamburg, well
	okay, well maybe we'd get like a 1000 maybe, or if we went to
	L.A maybe we'd get a 1000 or Chicago but it wasn't that much
	bigger really. You think of a bunch of young lads on their way
	up playing the Astoria headline well we never got bigger than
	that anywhere..you know.
	<p /><b>
	Did that annoy you?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> No, no I really don't know, I mean basically we kind of... the
	first line up I think me and Peter and Owen and fucking Dave
	and then Graham Its like.... when we started I mean we were just
	playing the pub like tonight, you know just playing the pub exactly
	like tonight in fact, Its like a bloody time capsule that isn't
	it? but errm you know when you get into playing live and that
	even the little level that we got to playing big theatres or
	like putting records out that was freaking us out because we'd
	gone into that totally unprepared we didn't know what the rules
	were, or whether there should be any rules or how we were gonna
	cope as people I mean you know..
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, everyone goes into it unprepared though.
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> That's what I loved about the '88 line up when we put that
	together, we had this mad meeting when we were all pissed in
	a hotel room and wrote the laws, so we didn't know each other
	very well, so we wrote these idiot laws, and that was it, it
	was almost like then we were sorted.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> It pisses me off to some extent because its made my, you
	know my life is full of sitting in front of a computer... doing
	stuff I don't really wanna do and err, you know I just made a
	new album but, I hadn't made an album for fifteen years and if
	things had turned out differently... you know I might have probably
	made several more... and well who knows and I'll never know anyway,
	so yeah to that extent....
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> But at the end of the day if we didn't get any bigger it's
	only because people didn't like us.
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> Yeah, exactly, well yeah..
	<p /><b>
	You could put that as part of it but I mean it's not
	all of it is it?
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> Well, I mean there was the breaks and I we never paid anyone
	a thousand quid a week to put us in the NME, you know we never
	had a publicist or any of that, in fact I rather famously fucked
	up our first meeting with a publicist in epic style by simple
	virtue of being on magic mushrooms and not liking Depeche Mode... (laughs-all)
	Yeah I probably didn't do our reputation in Epso circles any
	good that night. But Shaun from Microdisney, High Llama's as
	he is now he was with me and he was on them magic mushrooms too
	and he agreed with me, unfortunately the big publicist's girlfriend
	loved Depeche Mode as though they were brothers... was it Tim
	somebody... or no that's the bloke who rant the London office.

	<p /><b>
	The interviews about finished actually.
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> That's good actually because I was about to say something
	unbelievably disgraceful about Depeche Mode...
	<p />
	<b>Max:</b> No, no... (laughing)
	<p /><b>
	Oh! well we'll just leave it running for another minute
	then, come on!
	</b>
	<p />
	<b>Pat:</b> No,I'm gonna fucking button my lip man.

		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day One
		<br />June 8, 2002</b>
	</div>

	<p />
		Ich Bin Ein Hamburger!
	<p />
		A loooong first day. After all, I left Minneapolis at 1:00 pm,
	 arriving at 10:30 am Hamburg time. The connection from Boston
	 to Amsterdam was some 6 hours long, and the seats unreasonably
	 close together. Clearly they were designed with legless pygmies
	 in mind. The in-flight movies were 'Snow Dogs' and whatever the
	 hell the Brittney Spears movie is called, thereby completing
	 the aesthetic.
	<p />
		Arriving in Amsterdam officiated my first experience outside
	 of the continental US. The airport was a good primer for the
	 foreign experience, in that English appears to be the default
	 language. The flight attendants were all blonde Amazon supermodels
	 in bright sky blue uniforms. So far, Brian like-y this 'Eur-ope'.
	
	<p />
		I arrived in Hamburg to be met by the wonderful Owen Jones -
	 Drummer, tour organizer and hamburg-host with the JBC. We rode
	 the train into town, and sat in the front room of Casa de Jones,
	 listening to David J's most recent demo tape. We talked a bit
	 about the itinerary and proposed set lists, while he tried diligently
	 to find a bootleg that I didn't already have (success came with
	 Munich '85...he was so pleased to have stumped the one they call
	 'the archivist').
	<p />
		And then...sleep...
	<p />
		When I awoke, I found Owen, his girlfriend Baerbel and the just
	 arrived Max Eider out in the little garden wood-house/ bar. Max
	 and I caught up while Owen went off to prepare a fantastic pasta
	 supper for everyone.
	<p />
		Then it was off to the local pub, where the band will be playing
	 on Tuesday night. We played darts (501) after which I taught
	 them how to play cricket. It seemed ironic to be teaching a couple
	 Brits how to play darts (and cricket no less), but by the second
	 round, Max had got his game on, and put us all to shame.
	<p />
		It is, of course, world cup football (soccer) time, and apparently
	 most of Europe and certainly the Jones household revolves around
	 the tournament schedule. Me, I plan to sleep in...until I am
	 awakened by a couple of aging British rockers drunkenly shouting
	 'GOOOOOOAL'.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">
		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day Two
		<br />June 9, 2002</b>
	</div>
	<p />
		I awoke to find Owen once again bustling about the kitchen, preparing
	 a wonderful vegetarian breakfast, which we proceeded to enjoy
	 out in the yard. Again today, the boys were keen on watching
	 football. They were most excited to cheer on Japan, having found
	 a recent kinship after playing there for the first time last
	 Summer.
	<p />
		So, while the displaced English gentlemen watched soccer, Baerbel
	 and I went walking. Altona, which is the county we are in, was
	 having a festival. Sideshows and music, food and drink and fantastic
	 people watching. Max & Owen soon joined up with us, and we took
	 the ferry boat
	 down the river (gorgeous) and took the train back. I was glad
	 of this, since all the shops are closed on Sundays, and I desperately
	 needed my diet soda fix. I took advantage of the vending machines
	 at the station, and loaded up. I felt very much the ugly American,
	 buying four 1 liter bottles of diet coke...I'm sure the Euro-perception
	 is that we Yanks have coca cola in our veins...hmm perhaps they're
	 not half wrong in my case.
	<p />
		Still a bit jet lagged from the long journey over, I went down
	 for a nap. I was awakened by the boys blasting 'Southern Mark
	 Smith'. They laughed and said they considered a number of ways
	 to wake me up, but that seemed the most kind. Too true.
	<p />
		Chef Owen had prepared a homemade spinich pizza that was unbelievably
	 good. I did the washing up, wanting to earn my keep. The generosity
	 of these guys is too much, really...I've barely spent a Euro
	 since I arrived...every meal has been prepared, every train ticket
	 paid for. I had to insist on paying the bar tab at the pub this
	 evening... fortunately for me, it was a tame night for the fellows
	 who once sang 'I don't wanna think about how much I drink/ it's
	 a habit that's out of control/ I hope I never get dry before
	 I get old'. Little chance of that! Me on the other hand...
	<p />
		At the pub, the song 'He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother' came on,
	 and Owen confessed that 'soppy' as it is, he loves this song.
	 He asked the bartender if she would turn it up, which she did,
	 and upon it's conclusion, played it again. Our table just sort
	 of sat and swayed, enjoying the music. Just then an elderly gentlemen
	 wearing a bathrobe came in to buy cigarettes. I informed Owen
	 that he'd gone and woke the neighbors.
	<p />
		We returned to the flat, and I played DJ, introducing the Brits
	 to some of my contemporary favorites, Gorillaz, and Soul Coughing.
	 Then, in honor of the recent passing of Dee Dee Ramone, I put
	 on the Ramone's 'Blitzkrieg Bop' which then had us talking about
	 punk rock history until it was time to retire.
	<p />
		Tomorrow, Pat Fish, the Jazz Butcher hisself, and Ms. Kathy McGinty
	 arrive. No one is sure what time, and Owen refuses to call and
	 ask him. 'Feck him, if the bastard can't be bothered' was his
	 and Max's attitude, 'so long as he brings the rubber reptiles
	 (JBC mascots) for the tour bus, otherwise, there'll be hell to
	 pay.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">
		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day Three
		<br />June 10, 2002</b>
	</div>
	<p />
		Today was rather quiet...call it the calm before the storm. The
	 storm, of course being the arrival of a certain mad Northampton
	 tunesmith. Hurricane Pat, as it were.
	<p />
		We split up during the day, Owen went to get the beer, Max went
	 to the music store for guitar strings and such, and I went to
	 the shops. I had planned to go to the airport to greet the Northampton
	 faction, but Max had yet to return, so I stayed behind to let
	 him in.
	<p />
		Now, many of you know of my notorious sense of direction (or
	 lack therof), but it pales in comparison to Mr. Eider. Owen told
	 me that they once stopped off at a pub across from the airport
	 before their flight...across the street, mind you...and Max managed
	 somehow to get himself lost and nearly miss the plane.
	<p />
		Well, once again, Max entered what the band calls 'the Zone'...that
	 being the Twilight Zone, and what should have been about an hour
	 long errand became something of an all day exercise. The good
	 news, is that Max is quite at home in the Twilight Zone, as he's
	 spent a lot of time there.
	<p />
		Pat and Kathy arrived at about 8pm, and after hugs and warm greetings,
	 we all made our way out back to 'Fritzi's Bar'. I should describe
	 this. In Owen's back yard he's got a wooden...well, clubhouse
	 rather aptly describes it. A handpainted sign reads 'Fritzi's
	 Bar', named for his and Baerbel's first cat. The Jolly Roger
	 flies over the door.
	<p />
		Inside, there is a fully loaded bar, and 3 stools, which, when
	 occupied, means the place is packed. As Pat pointed out, the
	 bartender was clearly behind the design, in that there is as
	 much space behind the bar as there is in front of it. But, we
	 all agreed that the ergonomic design is neccessary...for nothing
	 must hinder the barkeep from the swift fulfilment of his duties.

	<p />
		Then, 'Barkeep Owen' became 'Chef Owen' once again, and we supped
	 on couscous. The inn is now at full capacity, so now it is really
	 a matter of feeding the troops.
	<p />
		Owen asked if the plan was to go to the pub afterwards, at which
	 Pat and Max looked at each other incredulously...
	<p />
		Max: "is the Pope Catholic?"
	<p />
		Pat: "Does a bear shit in the woods?"
	<p />
		Owen: "Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back" ... pause
	<p />
		Pat: "Thank you so much for that enduring mental image."
	<p />
		And so, off to the Pub it was. Pat and I had the chance to catch
	 up some. When we last met in LA, last year, his mother had just
	 died, a scant two weeks after my mom passed. We talked a bit
	 about dealing with that, although unfortunately, his situation
	 is compounded by having to deal with his mother's estate. From
	 the sound of it, it has been an altogether terrible ordeal. I
	 think this tour is the best thing for him...A chance to redirect
	 his energies and let loose.
	<p />
		Wishing to let the three old mates have an opportunity to catch
	 up on their own, and wanting to be rested for the whirlwind that
	 is to follow, I decided to retire early. Tomorrow 'Baby' arrives
	 (aka Steven D. Valentine, bassist and legal representation for
	 the JBC), and the pub will serve as something of a warm-up to
	 the tour ahead. Not to mention, at midnight's chime, the band
	 celebrates it's official 20th birthday. June 12, 1982 was the
	 first Jazz Butcher gig, and that same day, Pat said, they signed
	 on the dotted line. If they knew then that they would still be
	 doing this some 20 years later, They might have dropped the pen
	 and run screaming.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">

		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day 4
		<br />June 11, 2002</b>
		</a>
	</div>
	<p />
		Today was mostly business in preparation for this evening's show.

	<p />
		Owen & Kathy & I went to sort out the business of the tour bus,
	 whilst Pat & Max headed off to the airport to pick up Mr. Valentine.

	<p />
		A little background on Steve...he is a California native and
	 a JBC fan like myself. He volunteered to play with the boys at
	 one point, and...like many fans...was abducted. He
	 helped Max record his solo record last summer, and, in that
	 he is a lawyer, he serves as legal representation. As I say,
	 he is quite a bit younger than the pop stars he's gigging with,
	 and looks even younger than his age, hence the nickname of 'baby'.

	<p />
		So it was that we loaded up the bus, and went to the venue. This
	 was not an 'official gig' in any real sense, more of a party
	 and a warm up for the next week's shows. The pub itself is not
	 really designed for a rock show...they have folk music on Tuesdays.
	 So it was that the quarters were most tight on the 'stage'...also,
	 it was commented upon that the bar had never heard music so loud
	 before.
	<p />
		So loud, in fact, the politzei were called. As Pat pointed out,
	 'we may be old, but we're still antisocial.' So it was that the
	 gig was cut short...but they did make it to the midnight mark,
	 at which point baerbel brought out a birthday cake for the band
	 & guests.
	<p />
		The strangeness of the evening left the band feeling a bit out
	 of sorts, but a few pints and things looked brighter. At any
	 rate, tomorrow we leave for Munich, thus starting the official
	 tour.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">
		<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2002/Jun13.html">
		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day 5-6
		<br />June 12-13, 2002</b>
		</a>
	</div>
	<p />
		Day 5 was mostly travel. The day began with a phone call booking
	 the band for a second gig in Belgium...rock! We got on the road
	 at a fairly reasonable hour, Baerbel kissed us all good luck,
	 and we were on our way.
	<p />
		Everyone was still a bit weary from the night before, not to
	 mention getting up at an unGodly hour to watch football. The
	 drive was long, but we reached Nüremberg  in about 6 hours or
	 so. The initial plan was to go straight on to Munich, but Pat's
	 judgment at Nüremberg  (pun intended) was to stay the night and
	 pick up the additional two hours or so the next day.
	<p />
		The hotel we stayed at was French, and had all of the modern
	 conveniences of a plastic room with a mattress on the floor.
	 Indeed, we got onto the elevator, which promptly trapped us until
	 Owen smartly came to look for us. Good thing, too...for we know
	 what happens when you leave a Fish too long in an elevator (don't
	 we?)...Also, no phones in the room (hence, no internet connection,
	 hence no report...QED)
	<p />
		I enjoyed a much needed shower and a good night's sleep, and
	 in the morning, we had breakfast outside a small cafe. We again
	 took to the autobahn, arriving in Munich mid-afternoon.
	<p />
		After setting up, the band did a rehearsal (since they hadn't
	 had one...even prior to the Hamburg gig) and really tightened
	 up. By soundcheck they were in the groove, and well looking forward
	 to the show.
	<p />
		The club owner prepared dinner for all, after which I went for
	 a stroll. Former JBC alum Peter 'No Show' Crouch turned up, to
	 everyone's delight. I ran merchandise before and after the show,
	 and once again got to be 'JBC answer man', a job I am uniquely
	 suited for. Pat decided that I was in charge of 'Public relations',
	 and was pleased with the number of CDs that sold...so I am earning
	 my keep. :)
	<p />
		The show itself was great: a nice club, a good audience, and
	 the band was keen to play. Crouchy even got up (after a chant
	 of 'Crou-chy, Crou-chy') and played on 'Zombie Love'. Three or
	 four of the people that I sold CDs to hadn't heard of the band
	 before, so that itself speaks to the performance.
	<p />
		Tonight we are all flopping in one big room over the club...
	 Beds strewn about the floor, slumber party style. In the morning,
	 the band plans to go to the pub to watch more football. (The
	 good thing about not being into sports is, you get to sleep in.)
	 Then we make our way back to Nuremburg for the show there. No
	 cheap French hotel tomorrow though, an old friend of Owen's will
	 be putting us up.
	<p />
		So to bed, to dream of windmills off the autobahn and breakfast
	 strudel. Mmmmm.

	<p />
		It is incredible how different each and every day is.
	<p />
		I woke up this morning and realized that I'd only been in Germany
	 a week! It seems like so much longer...not in a bad way, it's
	 just that so much goes down day to day.
	<p />
		We left Munich and took the short jaunt back to Nuremburg. This
	 time, Crouchy was with us...making the crowded bus even more
	 crowded...but, the more the merrier with the JBC.
	<p />
		The club... how shall I say it? Well, it made the bus seem positively spacious.
	 But, with the JBC it's roll up your sleeves and get to it. After sound check, our
	 hostess du jour, Katarina (an old friend of Owen's) took us for
	 a stroll en route to get dinner. We went walking through the
	 garden of a castle that overlooks the city...and me without my
	 camera, grrr...but it was gorgeous. We all just sort of strolled
	 in silence, soaking in the beautiful surroundings.
	<p />
		For dinner, we sat outside a small cafe, and while my vegetarian

	 to try the ostrich. I didn't even know people ate ostrich.
	 Pretty much like steak. Good, and curiosity satisfied.
	<p />
		The show was great, and the owner, Stefan (this sort of Gregarious
	 Fabio) was soooooo pleased. Many free beers for the band...Kathy,
	 Katarina and I practically had to drag the boys from the bar,
	 but not before Stefan had smuggled them a bottle of strawberry
	 vodka for the road.
	<p />
		We returned to Katarina's flat, where the combined presence of
	 vodka & Crouchy ensured that the party continue on well into
	 the morning...

		Woke up and hit the road, sans Crouchy, who returns to London,
	 and made the trek for Bielefeld. A four hour drive stretched
	 waaaaay long by construction on the autobahn. We arrived with
	 just enough time to set up & soundcheck before the club opened
	 its doors. The sound was excellent, and though the crowd was
	 small, they were impossibly enthusiastic, demanding no less than
	 three encores.
	<p />
		After the show we went to an Irish pub, where a horrible British
	 cover band was playing. It occurred to me that I was in Germany,
	 listening to a British Band in an Irish pub doing covers of 'Boston'.
	 It was like the UN...if Butros Butros Ghali played piss poor
	 Jimmy Page licks. But, we had spinich pizza, which was niiiiiice.

	<p />
		Tomorrow we must leave early for Belgium...probably a six hour
	 drive. But Tomorrow & Tuesday's shows are both in Belgium, so
	 we will have a few days without hectic schedules and lengthy
	 bus rides.

	<p />
		When we last left our heroes...We were in Bielefeld, which was
	 kind of a downer...but what a difference a day makes!
	<p />
		The drive to Belgium was quite a long one. Pat told me that in
	 Belgium it is 'the future'. I didn't know what he meant. I told
	 him that that must be why everyone drives so fast...so that they
	 stay in the future. But all I saw of it was quaint and rustic
	 living.
	<p />
		We arrived in Kortrijk. It was to be an outdoor show, and lo!
	 the outdoor in question was a serene garden affair...gorgeous,
	 and the weather, perfect for a concert outside. Max confessed
	 that he was sorry to disrupt the serenity...and so the show began
	 rather quietly. Turns out, those in attendance very much enjoyed
	 the squelch.
	<p />
		The sound technicians were TOP! Sooo much can vary from venue
	 to venue, but these guys were true professionals. The sound was
	 glorious. There were several 'punters', but many sort of stumbled
	 upon the event. There was a family sitting dead center, young
	 and old. Kathy and I were certain that these were fans by their
	 response, but they came up to us afterwards and informed us that
	 they had just come in to eat, but LOVED the band. (Kathy & I
	 laughed as the father bounced his daughter on his knee singing
	 'sha la la la, ooh my my - she's on drugs'.)
	<p />
		Our host du jour was another old friend of Owen's by the name
	 of Jean Pierre. He is a very earthy guy with an intense love
	 of music. He positively BEAMED during the show. Afterwards, we
	 all had dinner & drinks (I should mention, I am still the sober
	 man I was when I left, tempting though it might be) and were
	 escorted by Jean Pierre to our accommodations for the next few
	 days.
	<p />
		The farmhouse! Wow. Basically a friend's summer home. Beds for
	 everyone and a shower (HUGE bonuses when on the road), with all
	 manner of animals living next door. Quiet and peaceful...well,
	 until this group gets wound up.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">
		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day 10

	</div>
	<p />
		Monday. Our day off. I feel that I should mention at this point
	 that I had some concerns going into this trip. I mean, I have
	 gotten to know these guys over the last few years, and although
	 we have developed something of a friendship, two weeks and many
	 miles is a different story. When I first arrived, I realized
	 'holy shit, you have put yourself in a position where you could
	 wind up being in the way or becoming an annoyance...
	<p />
		But, I am happy to say that the opposite is true. I have been
	 something of a help, where and when I can, and each of the group
	 individually has expressed that they have been happy I was along.
	 As Owen observed, my presence kind of diffuses some of the potential
	 'incidents' that sometimes erupt amongst a band in it's 20th
	 year. Like a family being on best behavior when company's over.

	<p />
		Aaanyway...I awoke to find that Owen, Max and Steve had went
	 and gotten breakfast for everyone. We spent some time relaxing,
	 and then All but Kathy & Pat went into town, presumably to buy
	 musical equipment, but really to watch football in the pub.
	<p />
		I took the opportunity to explore the square. Ypres, the city
	 we were in, was a front line during WWI....and basically, the
	 entire place was just leveled. The Cathedral that stands in it's
	 center was rebuilt EXACTLY using the same stones, brick by brick.
	 It was completed around 1968 (to give some indication of the
	 length of the process), yet it is very much as it was when first
	 built in the 1400's.
	<p />
		After the game (Belgium lost, sadly...would have made for an
	 exciting time had they won), we hit the shops, loading up on
	 groceries & beer (one in the same, for some). We then returned
	 to our rural paradise.
	<p />
		In the evening, we went to Jean Pierre's for a regular feast
	 (I swear, our hosts on this trip have been unbelievably kind!)
	 We stayed the evening, but called it (relatively) early so that
	 everyone could rest up.

	<p />
		Owen's Birthday and the gig in Ypres. I sang Owen the ComedySportz
	 birthday song, which he enjoyed (I guess if you've never heard
	 it before, it's still funny). We watched football (Italy vs.
	 South Korea) which was (apparently) the most exciting game of
	 the cup thus far (overtime, with Korea pulling it out with a
	 beautiful header in the final minutes). Okay...I confess, I have
	 taken the most PASSING interest in the sport. It's the obsession
	 here, so...when in Rome, or Belgium as the case may be....
	<p />
		A cat had had kittens in the shed. The runt of the litter, the
	 cutest & friendliest, Owen named 'Corea'(sic) for the victors
	 in that morning's cup. Lengthy debate was held as to the logistics
	 of bringing the kitten on the bus back to Hamburg. In the end,
	 Owen thinks he will go back in a few month's time, and retrieve
	 the tiny cutie.
	<p />
		We went to the venue, situated right next to the cathedral, and
	 got set up. Another outdoor show...more punters, and even more
	 passersby. This was a two-set deal, and the first set, found
	 Pat a bit reserved. He was disconcerted by the huge number of
	 people, yet the mere smattering of applause. We informed him
	 that everyone was drinking, and therefore, no one had hands free
	 to clap. Armed with this information (not to mention Pat finding
	 some kind of undisclosed inspiration in-between sets), the band
	 launched into the second half in high gear, filling the square
	 with the 'ROCK show'...a far cry from the more pop-flavored garden
	 show of two nights before. Beers were being dropped in favor
	 of clapping and cheering. This was the sound of the band having
	 fun, and Pat in particular going positively MENTAL. Needless
	 to say, the band went after the post-show festivities with a
	 similar fervor to that of the show itself. Max nearly had to
	 drag Steve from the pub at the end of it. We left Jean Pierre
	 DJ-ing the night away.
	<p />
		We gave Owen his birthday cake and gift, complete with card (which
	 I illustrated) signed by all. We had cake, listened to music,
	 and basically gave the rooster next door a dose of his own medicine,
	 waking him up at an unGodly hour.
	<p />
	<div class="iview_intro">
		<b>JBC 20th Anniversary Tour Travelogue - Day 12
		<br />June 19, 2002</b>
	</div>
	<p />
		I awoke to find Jean Pierre & his wife laid out on the lawn.
	 Everyone slept in (well deserved), and we packed and cleaned
	 (yes, some bands trash their hotels, others restore their farmhouse
	 to it's original state). We bid farewell to our gracious hosts,
	 loaded up the bus and began the long journey home.
	<p />
		Fast forward 8 hours...well, I wish we could have. That was how
	 long the drive from Ypres back to Hamburg was. Even the relative
	 comfort of the 'Eiderlounge' (Max's permanent and pillowed haven
	 in the back of the bus) proved uncomfortable by the journey's
	 end. But, we left at just the right time (afternoon) to avoid
	 traffic, and Baerbel was waiting to greet the weary travellers.

	<p />
		Owen's brother, Billy, had arrived for the concert on Saturday.
	 We all piled into Fritzi's bar for drink and tales of the last
	 week. Max and I decided to retire to the accomodations down the
	 street (out-of town friends of Owen's), and found it after a
	 brief foray into the Twilight Zone.
	<p />
		Which brings us to the present moment. The wee hours of the morning...or
	 closing in on 10 in the evening if you're in Minneapolis, which
	 I will be soon. Tomorrow, breakfast at the Jones residence, and
	 Pat has said he will see me to the airport. So, next you hear
	 from me, I will be a great deal closer to you. And, you'll see
	 me coming a mile off, because I almost certainly will be beaming
	 for weeks to come.

	<div class="iview_intro">
	We talk to Pat Fish about the new compilation, the players involved and why
	we need his Free Lunch.
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_q">
	<b>Apollox:</b>The Kizzy period, this seems nicely covered here and seemed a solid
	and creative line up for about 2 or 3 years, obviously I am aware of his
	illness and untimely death so I won't go into that particular area in any
	detail but was wondering how much impact this was to have on the band at
	this stage in it's career?
	</div>
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
	<b>Pat:</b> Oddly enough, I don't think that Kizzy's misfortune had that much to
	do with it. He went sick on the way back from a gig in Sheffield in
	September 1989, and was in the hospital by the next day. Almost immediately
	it became clear that he wouldn't be fit for any gigs for at least several
	weeks. Meanwhile, we were looking at starting an unprecedented nine week
	tour of the USA and Canada. We spoke with Kiz and he urged us to carry on
	and do the dates, so Richard Formby was invited to come in as Emergency
	Guitarist. I'd known him for years, he was involved with two or three acts
	that were recording for Glass in the early days (Religious Overdose, In
	Embrace, maybe some others that I forgot). Richard settled in quite well
	and we had a great tour. When we got back from tour it was Christmas. Then
	on 8th January we went into the studio to record "Basement". Richard was
	invited along, as he already knew some of the tunes (Mr. Odd, Girl-Go) from
	the tour. Paul, Laurence and I put down the backing tracks first, then
	awaited the arrival of Rich, Alex Lee (another guest) and Kiz himself. When
	Kiz arrived, we were all pretty freaked-out at the state of him. After his
	operations and stuff he was visibly sedated and not really "with it" at
	all. He put a little bit of guitar and singing on "Excellent" (the Girl-Go
	b-side), but even that was a bit of a struggle. So the guitars on the album
	are all Richard, Alex, Paul Mulreany (he loves to play a bit of rhythm)
	and myself. By the time we had finished "Basement" it was time to carry on
	touring, this time in Europe. With Kiz in a state, Richard came along once
	again. By now we were completely used to him, and felt quite comfortable
	with the idea that he was The Lead Guitarist. We stayed on the road in
	Europe from February to May 1990.
	<p />
			 In about July 1990 Sonic Boom came around looking for
	collaborators in what would become Spectrum. We talked about Richard, and
	Sonic ended up making him a rather handsome cash offer to get involved in
	the Spectrum project. Richard had the grace to come and explain to me about
	the situation, but I could hardly object, as I'd actually spent a fair bit
	of time "selling" the idea to Sonic in the first place. Richard played his
	last gig with the JBC (for a while, anyway) at a festival in Sardinia in
	September 1990.
	<p />
			 We then had another US/Canada tour looming, so it was time to go
	out and find another guitarist. We actually held auditions (the only time
	we have ever done this) down in London. Among the people we saw was Pete
	Crouch (not the lanky striker currently plying his trade at Norwich City),
	but he seemed a bit "out of his depth" at the time and we ended up taking
	Julian Poole with us. (Jazza, as he gets called, went on to join
	Strangelove, and is currently with the band Witness). By the end of the
	1990 US tour Laurence was feeling increasingly unhappy with the band, more
	socially than musically. He was in some small way "losing it". On our
	return to London he hooked up with Terry Bickers to start Levitation. I saw
	the first gig. Terry had been a mate of the band for a while, and there had
	even been talk of us drafting him into the JBC on guitar, but McGee wasn't
	having it ("he's too mad"). So that was Laurence gone to Planet Terry.
	Paul, meanwhile, hadn't come home at all! He was going out with a girl from
	LA and had decided to spend Christmas over there with her. At the same time
	John Langley, the Blue Aeroplanes drummer (also later in Strangelove) quit
	the band for the very reason that they were planning to record their next
	album in LA. John - at the time anyway - considered LA to be the home of
	The Devil and was having none of it. In early January I got a call from the
	Aeroplanes explaining the situation and asking if, since
	he was on the spot, they could use Paul on the album. Obviously I said yes,
	and that's how Paul began his association with the Aeroplanes.
	<p />
	All of which meant that by mid-January 1990 the band was no more. I phoned
	up Pete Crouch and we started on building the next generation of the JBC.
	So that (NOT in a nutshell) is how the JBC second line-up came to finish.
	Poor Kiz was only a peripheral figure in it really. We lasted another 15
	months or so after his departure.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	 So how did this affect the nucleus of the group once he had to
	leave, did you feel you were alone again in terms of a writing partner as I
	believe he contributed greatly particularly on Fishcoteque?
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	 Kiz was certainly a good partner in terms of writing guitar parts and
	so on, but he wouldn't generally contribute to the songs themselves. It
	sounds harsh, but we didn't really miss him once he had to leave. You have
	to remember that before we knew that he was sick, his behaviour had already
	become pretty erratic. I can remember having a conversation with Paul
	during June 1989 in which we were actually talking about "giving him one
	last chance to get his shit together". Of course, only a few weeks later we
	found out what he had been struggling with. In fact, it's fair to say that
	the line-up of the day was very well-balanced creatively. Everybody was
	bringing in positive ideas off their own bat. From 1988 through to 1990
	felt like a very mad, creative and enjoyable time.
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	 The JBC has had its (probably more than most actually) share of
	compilations, is the world really ready for another?
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	 Poor old World... Honestly, I think probably not. I have started to
	refer to the JBC Pointless Re-Issues Library. Still, maybe somebody will
	like it. There are a couple of oddities on there for truly, madly hardcore.
	And it's nice that record companies still want to put this stuff out in the
	public domain. Altogether, though, it doesn't mean much to me apart from
	the fact that it's my debut as a sleeve designer. All the proposed front
	covers that the "artist" from the record company submitted were truly,
	desperately shite. So MC Bot and I opened up the Photoshop and went to
	work. To our astonishment, the thing was accepted!
	 	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	 Do you have any say in the content and are you consulted before
	hand, or are these things thrown together (loose expression) without any
	real involvement from you?
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	 To be fair to Rev-Ola they did consult me over the track listing. I
	sent them back my idea of an interesting compilation, one that would
	feature unusual and mental stuff, but Rev-Ola came back to me and asked for
	more of the "hits". Urrrrm..."hits"??? What "hits"?
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	 Personally I love compilations if they are handled well and
	include 'bonus' material ('Free Lunch' does) there are some obvious 'cash
	in's out there, particularly if an artist has just begun to be successful,
	the obligatory 'early label releases' tend to errm... yes lets say it how
	it is.. cash in on the success. (Adam and the Ants - Decca stuff is
	probably a nice example). I am well aware of the other side of the coin too
	of course in that this may well be the only way to obtain long deleted
	tracks, in which case they will be welcome but other times it seems that
	labels throw together any old shit that has been flogged, flogged and
	flogged again (Stranglers - Hugh Cornwell period springs to mind, with Epic
	and EMI etc constantly repackaging the most bizarre compilations,
	unessential even to die hards. Oh! the question...whaddya (pun intended)
	think of the way yours are handled?
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	 Well, that business about the "hits" kinda sums up what's wrong with
	compilations for me. Once folks have got one copy of "She's a Yoyo" they
	don't really need any more, do they? So there's me, trying to put on mad
	shit that would make for an interesting few minutes, and there's the record
	company saying "No, more hits". It seems to me that with an act this old
	and this (over) compiled, they should be a little bit more courageous. But
	I don't want to complain. I still remember when i would have given an arm
	and a leg (with a side-order of kidneys) to have one single record out.
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	 Finally what's left in the vaults from the real early days, any
	plans to finally clear out, like re-issue Bath Of Bacon (Jazz Butcher debut
	long player from 1983) with the extra tracks, I'm sure there is a need you
	know....
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	 Well, the Glass stuff isn't really under my control, as you know, and
	I think it's fair to say that "Cake City" (last years round up /
	compilation of the Glass Catalogue) did a fairly good job of trawling the
	vaults for mental left-overs from that time.
	I feel all right about the JBC right now. If folks want to, they can easily
	get a hold of copies of "Scandal", "Distressed", "Cake City", "Rotten Soul"
	and now this Rev-Ola deal. It seems to me that 5 albums of JBC is a fair
	amount for folks to be getting on with. I don't think I would have expected
	so much of the stuff still to be available in 2003. For the future, well
	I'd certainly like to get Wilson recording a bit more. We're feeling good
	about that, and it's my main project now. The thing is, we're not really
	actively seeking a deal. But then I've always found that good things tend
	to turn up out of the blue anyway, like the London date we just did. We
	weren't expecting that, and we certainly wouldn't have dared to go for a
	venue as good as Cargo, but it just fell into our laps. So I guess we'll
	just keep on doing what we do and see what turns up.
	<P>
			 I've also been thinking about the idea of making a "solo" record,
	basically just me with the occasional guest singer or soloist. When I was
	in LA last, in the summer of 2001, I spoke to a number of musicians and
	studio guys out there about maybe doing something like this. Unfortunately
	the balloon went up just a few weeks later (Dude! Where's my Country?)and
	now I don't dare to go to America until proper Regime Change has been
	effected. Come on, Howard Dean! Right now, though, folks have enough JBC
	stuff to be going on with, so I shan't be rushing into anything on the
	singer-songwriter front. I'll keep grinding away with the Wilson gang and
	give people a little time off from The Butcher..

	The New Moon are a familiar-looking local duo. Their lively, pacey songs
	are a bit too 80s-like in their use of wacky word-play and funny chord
	changes, trying to come over a bit too clever and knowing. Nice bass from a
	fella who looks like Barney Sumner but sounds like Peter Hook, but they
	need something extra to make the leap from pub duo to a proper band.
	If it's wackiness you're after, then Anton Barbeau turns the wackometer up
	to 11. Apparently quite well known in his native Sacramento, he's produced
	eight albums of intelligent, offbeat country-tinged pop with a heavy, and
	openly acknowledged, debt to XTC. Curiously, he acts like a returning hero
	playing to a packed stadium whereas he is of course, addressing a crowd
	who've never heard of him, in the smallest venue in town. Look beyond the
	hyperactive showmanship and there's a real song-writing talent here. If he
	could calm down a bit, he might come across more Andy Partridge and less
	Kenny Everett.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher, AKA Pat Fish, lived here as a student and his May morning
	busking sessions outside the Radcliffe Camera are still fondly remembered
	by many. Twenty years on and he's hardly changed a jot, from the foppish
	haircut to the magpie-like collection of classic pop influences. He
	introduces his set as a karaoke session, which takes the form of an
	electric guitar, a backing track and a trip through the catalogues of such
	luminaries as Lou Reed, Wings and er, Grandmaster Melle Mel. Fun though
	this is, we could have done with more than the solitary Jazz Butcher song,
	as he has always been savagely underrated. It's all over too soon but great
	to see him back.
	<p />
	the black watch (no capitals for them) is, tonight, main man John Andrew
	Frederick on his lonesome. Another Californian with a love of classic
	British pop, he's combined a career as an English professor with a sporadic
	output of seven albums over eighteen years. Well-crafted pop gems in the
	style of Robyn Hitchcock and our own Jazz Butcher flow effortlessly forth,
	but there's a certain unmistakeable American expansiveness. Though bigger
	on the enthusiasm than variety, new single "Innercity Garden" has the
	makings of a summer anthem.
	<p />
	Tonight's theme has been well-crafted pop with elaborate, imaginative
	lyrics. Throw in the free black watch single and you've got the bargain of
	the month.

	They're all out tonight. Local madcap poet ${terry} is gyrating about
	brandishing a hefty crucifix. A white-haired gent is sitting with his ear
	pressed against the PA cabinet, like a master safe-cracker. A man next to
	me has come up to see the bands 'in case any of them sound like The Saw
	Doctors'. It's warming up to be a fun night.
	<p />
	The New Moon opens proceedings. I'm starting to warm to their acoustic
	cabaret, which wobbles continually between the sentimental and the
	cerebral. With songs about 'dark matter' and God's Kodak (possibly), they
	look and sound like two chemistry teachers who thought up a double act in
	the desperate attempt to interest the class, then realised they had a real
	knack for performing and threw the old textbooks and retort stands away.
	<p />
	Am I getting carried away with that image? Well, it's that sort of night.
	Next up we have US visitor Anton Barbeau. How he survives in laidback
	California I'll never know ? he'd look excitable at a convention of extreme
	caffeine abusers in a room with a very hot floor. Bounding around the
	stage, swinging his tiny guitar and barely getting his words out in a
	flurry of excitement, he cuts an imposing figure. But despite the slightly
	overbearing zaniness, his songs actually have an unexpected melodic
	elegance, recalling of the better pop of the early 70s: the main reference
	that popped into my head was George Harrison. Oh, and the Grumbleweeds.
	<p />
	Pat Fish used to be The Jazz Butcher, and made about a million albums years
	ago, most notably for Creation. He's still going strong, knocking up
	backing tracks in his house & performing songs for us on his guitar (In
	fact, he only dredges up one Jazz Butcher tune, the others are all new).
	The rhythms are hardly the height of technology ? in fact, it sounds like
	he made them on an Amiga ? but the simplicity and homeliness adds to the
	effect. A few tracks veer close to sounding like muzak versions of New
	Order, but in general the communicative effect of these well-written songs
	trumps the paucity of the sonic palette. A warm welcome back.
	<p />
	Finally, one fifth of The Black Watch - a cult band, apparently - takes the
	stage. Again, 'unpretentious' is probably the best word to describe the
	show. That's 'unpretentious', but definitely not 'unintelligent' or
	'unadventurous'. Perhaps his songs were a little less immediate than
	anybody else tonight, but they were presented with such humorous (and
	slightly camp) sincerity that concentration doesn't seem a chore.
	<p />
	All the acts tonight are wrestling something unique from the sparsest of
	materials, and I can't help but be reminded of the improvised music of the
	previous night. You know, for all it's limitations, sometimes The Port
	Mahon seems like the best venue in town.
	<p />
	Oh yes, and The Saw Doctors man enjoyed it in the end, too.

ultimate jazz butcher fan jim ruiz happened to be in new york city when the jazz butcher played at spike hill, brooklyn, on sunday, <a href="${jbc_gigs}/2013/Jun15.html">june 15, 2013</a>! here is his review of the show.	<p />
it was a beautiful, still night in brooklyn when this fledgling music critic and his wife made their way to spike hill in williamsburg. after a car journey of about 1200 miles, from minnesota, the last 5 were covered on bicycles thanks to the new bike share citi bikes, which were located near our departure and destination points.	<p />
spike hill is a smallish venue with brick walls and a full bar and restaurant next door. while waiting for the show to begin in side bar, I was introduced, for the first time, to JBC sideman max eider, coincidentally my favorite living guitar player. luckily, I didn’t stutter and max graciously excused himself as the duo, dressed in suits which could loosely be described as “english,” was about to take the stage. I made my way to the front of the room and the show began.	<p />
it began with an oldie, “holiday,” as in english speaking gentleman on…. although odd to hear without the typewriter rhythm behind it, obviously a good one to warm up with, I remember thinking while watching max, “hey, I could play that!” that thought was a fleeting one as the set began in earnest.	<p />
this is as good a point as any to give my impression of pat fish, a.k.a. the butcher or just butchie to his friends. clearly enjoying himself, he was seated on a low chair playing a borrowed ovation acoustic guitar. a better frontman they simply do not make as he put the crowd, and just as importantly max, at ease with his pithy and hilarious banter. for instance, coming to max’s rescue later in the set when max sang the wrong first verse to his own composition “who loves you now?” with a comment to the effect that he (pat) was always the one to mess up. on another occasion telling the crowd if they wanted to sing along with a chorus – “please don’t.”	<p />
the set was front-loaded with songs off the new album, the last of the gentleman adventurers, kicking off with the title track. these new songs too benefited from brief intros from pat as when he revealed later in the set that the song “shame about you” was inspired by involuntarily uttering the phrase after seeing himself in the mirror one day, and when the identity of “black raoul” was definitively revealed to be his cat. the crowd, less familiar with these new songs, waited patiently, but with rapt attention, for the fun to really begin, and they weren’t disappointed.	<p />
the set then moved into what could be described as the glass era, the peak years of pat and max’s collaboration together. the first one, “southern mark smith” caused me to sing, a little too loudly, along with the line “I’ve found out already what makes my heart sing!” much to the irritation of nearby revelers.	<p />
then came max’s own tour de force, the aforementioned “who loves you now?” before the song began, max made reference onstage to an interview I conducted with him where it was revealed to the world, and remembered by himself, that wes montgomery’s version of “polka dots and moonbeams” was his inspiration for the song.	<p />
I asked myself, “how can my life get any better than this?”	<p />
after a rousing “girlfriend” came the sublime “betty page,” with max’s virtuosity, now in fifth gear, on display for all to hear. after a brief return to the new album for “shame about you,” max lent his hand to “shirley macLaine,” a post collaboration song from the 1991 album condition blue. the favor was soon to be returned.	<p />
the set had seemed to last for about 15 minutes when eider walked, a little mysteriously, off the front of the stage, as there was no backstage option. fish, looking perhaps for the first time a little unsure what to do, just stayed on stage as the crowd, almost better described as an unruly mob, demanded more.	<p />
the butcher graciously put max back in the spotlight for the closing two numbers, “partytime” with its genre-defining major 7 chords and the best guitar solo of the ’80s and “drink”—max’s own song, effectively giving the sideman the last word.	<p />
like love, perhaps musical collaborations are lovelier the second time around. If that is the case, and it appears to be, the future looks bright for jazz butcher fans such as myself. I only wish you could have been there.	<p />
postscript – for guitar players (nerds) only after the show I asked max way too many questions the first one being, naturally, what kind of guitar were you playing? “a gretsch” was his answer. when pressed for a little more information he told me it was a “double” anniversary. favored more by country players than jazzbos. the “double” anniversary features hi-lo-tron single coil pickups.	<p />
as I was standing near the stage I can attest to the fact that max plugged directly into a fender deville 4 x 10 amp. fiddling with a couple of the knobs during the show. the chorus effect made no appearance, apparently banished to a bygone era.	<p />

	First came the Conspiracy. Then the Sikkorskis From Hell. Now, following thirty illustrious years at the coalface of sardonic and darkly comedic indiepop, Pat Fish is back with a brand new thing: The Jazz Butcher Quartet.
	<p />
	Northampton’s cheekiest troubadour is best know for his twisted, obsessive songs. Tunes which focus a little unhealthily on dead authors, dead actors, elephants, tigers, chickens and Mark E Smith. His albums, eight of which came out through Creation at the rabid insistence of superfan Alan McGee, are consistently hailed as classics of their genres – whether that might be the Birthday Party-meets-Janglepop of ‘A Scandal In Bohemia’, the full-on VU assault of the live record or the super-twee sweeping sounds that are the hallmark of ‘Distressed Gentlefolk’.
	<p />
	He’s big in Oxford, bigger in Hamburg, and bloody big in Japan – where he makes his very long-awaited live return later this year.
	<p />
	But he has chosen somewhere closer to home, London’s semi-legendary Hope and Anchor, to launch his all-new Quartet this Saturday. Here, in an exclusive for Louderthanwar, Pat Fish tells us what it’s all about…
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	<p />
	“In the early months of 2014 a friend offered me a little money to book bands into a gin palace that she was opening. We had a meeting and I went away with a fairly good idea, I thought, of what she wanted and what she would be able to afford. In the pursuit of my new objective I spoke with a couple of musicians from around town who, I thought, might well be up for being paid good money to play background standards as the gins went down.
	<p />
	The first two players that I asked both immediately said the same thing: “What, with you?”
	<p />
	This really wasn’t what I had had in mind at all, but these were cool guys, so while the booking job went more and more to hell, I started a little recreational jamming with ${garofalo} and his tiny drum kit and ${stevenew} with his enormous, beautiful double bass.
	<p />
	Steve New was recently back from playing on the ships, travelling all over the world playing anything and everything as he went. Now he found himself re-united with Steve Garofalo, who had been his partner in rhythm since the early eighties. The two of them played for many years with Northampton’s legendary ${tom_hall} and in other bands besides. From the very first tune that we played together, I could sense the understanding and feeling that they had between them. And I could feel the swing.
	<p />
	The Steves are educated men from a much deeper tradition than the ones that initially inspired me. When Max Eider and I were failing to get into Ronnie Scott’s to see Nina Simone on her legendary run of dates, Stevie G was there to watch her come stamping into the club carrying her shopping and cussing out the boys waiting on the stand. At the time I was first discovering the Living Room scene, the Steves were out the back of a theatre in Milton Keynes rolling a foot-long spliff for Slim Gaillard.
	<p />
	I can’t remember the name of the first number that we played together but I do remember saying immediately afterwards “Wow. I don’t deserve this.”
	<p />
	We continued to play each Thursday for a few weeks with no specific end in mind. Perhaps, we thought, if I could somehow repair the damage done by my rubbish attempts at being a booking agent, we might get a nice gig at that gin palace. To be honest, we were having a really good time, enjoying one another’s company…developing, in fact, the kind of collective personality that marks the best bands.
	<p />
	Stevie G had a copy of the latest Jazz Butcher album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, and – for the want of something to play – we started learning up the songs. We played quietly, acoustically, in Steve’s kitchen. It was a fabulous experience to be able to fingerpick acoustic guitar and sing acoustically with a full-on rhythm section. It was luxurious. It also sounded astonishingly close to the sound of the actual record, something which we hadn’t particularly been expecting. It seemed that the band and the songs suited each other well.
	<p />
	After three or four sessions, Steve thought that it would be as well to check with his next door neighbour that our efforts weren’t disturbing her in any way. She didn’t know what he was talking about.
	<p />
	As the spring began to take a hold, so we began to realise that we had the germ of something potentially pretty entertaining here. We were adding songs to our repertoire at ridiculous speed, sometimes almost at the speed of thought. Thinking that we could perhaps use a lead instrument, we invited Steve New’s colleague from the ships, trumpeter ${simon}, to come and have a play.
	<p />
	I still don’t know all that much about Simon but he has clearly been there and done that. Legend has it that he backed Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes on Top of the Pops. Why not? The Steves both played several gigs with Wayne Jackson.
	<p />
	Simon fitted in immediately; a dry, stylish beatnik with a good ear and a worldview every bit as cynical and twisted as you need to operate within the collective solipsism that we had already built up. I can recall at one point remarking – perhaps controversially – “They’re farming us, man!” From the band came nothing but earnest nods and resigned grunts of assent.
	<p />
	Summer arrived and the French Windows in Steve’s kitchen were thrown open to the courtyard. Rehearsals began to stretch out into marathon affairs, with breaks for luxurious dinners, drinking and smoking. Close friends would sometimes come and hang out, enjoying the vibe. You know, like people do when they are in their teens or early twenties.
	<p />
	We reached the conclusion one evening over a particularly fine dinner that, even if we were to have a Number One record, life probably couldn’t actually get any better than it already was. Nonetheless, we had become a band and there’s not much point being a band unless you are going to play for people. We knew that we had to try to export the vibe that we had built up in Steve’s kitchen. We resolved to play our first gig without a PA system.
	<p />
	We took hold of <a href="${jbc_gigs}/2014/Jun27_2000.html">the upstairs room of a fashionable local bar</a>. In the time that people usually spend shouting “One…two…” we decorated the room, added flowers and incense, brought in Steve’s ancient wooden gramophone and a bunch of old blues records to serve as the “disco”. Somebody later congratulated us on the “Limehouse opium den vibe”.
	<p />
	We played nearly all the Gentleman Adventurer album, a couple of old Jazz Butcher tunes and covers including Davy Graham’s “Neighbour Neighbour”, Slim Gaillard’s “Dunking Beigels” and Rosetta Howard’s immortal “When You’s A Viper”. The audience of about 40 people, bless them, sat pin-drop quiet for an hour and a half, then went mental at the end.
	<p />
	Two more local shows followed, the latter at the Parlour, the very gin palace that had accidentally set the whole thing rolling. By that time the band was playing numbers that it did not know. Numbers that might, indeed, not even really exist. The people at the Parlour declared that we were exactly what they had been looking for. Funny how things turn out.
	<p />
	In August, Simon took a sabbatical while the great Max Eider came in to play a couple of dates with the band. An unbelievably eventful three date jaunt down to the south coast nonetheless brought concrete proof that the core of this band was indestructible, axiomatic…right. For the first time we took on rock type venues with PA systems and our sound still worked.
	<p />
	Now, with Eider retired to his Northern fastness, Simon (or “Jimi Hendrix” as I like to call him) takes up a full-time role and the band becomes officially The Jazz Butcher Quartet. Because we are so sonically versatile we can play in rock clubs, bars, living rooms or fields of sheep. We want to play out anywhere and everywhere. We have nothing better to do!”
	</div>
	<p class="iview_outro">
	The Jazz Butcher Quartet makes its London debut at the Hope & Anchor, Islington, London N1 on <a href="${jbc_gigs}/2014/Sep20_2000.html">Saturday 20th September</a> with special guest supports Elia and the Low Tears and Texasbob.

	<div class="iview_intro">
	<p />For many of us John Peel fans, The Jazz Butcher was a band that your friend put on in the car while driving; usually as part of a clever mix tape with other buzz worthy songs. It was the type of music that made you stop, focus, snicker at the humor in the lyrics, then casually ask: "Who's this? It's really good." The Jazz Butcher is the group you've maybe never heard of that every one of your favorite rock stars sites as a major influence on their formative years. R.E.M., Tom Waits, you name 'em: they're all big fans of Pat Fish and his buddy Max Eider, the duo that makes up the core of the Jazz Butcher and has for many a year. The spunky, free-flowing, often-hilarious rants from Pat are enough to make any lover of wit an instant fan. It's not uncommon to hear him mellowly sing something like, "This is party time, and it's better than a cold bath with someone that you don't like," or "Caroline Wheeler's birthday present was made entirely from the skins of dead Jim Morrisons: that's why it smelled so bad." The zaniness of the songs is a pure representation of the creative spontaneity that made the 1980s such an incredible time for music. As someone else whose formative years were shaped watching <em>Ferris Bueller</em> and listening to the selective soundtrack of John Hughes, I'm a big admirer of the genre and specifically of Pat's work.	<p />
	<p />As an Oxford graduate with a philosophy degree, Pat's almost too witty for my simple questions about booze. I knew it would be hilarious and entertaining to hear Pat talk candidly about almost anything, but considering a number of The Jazz Butcher's lyrics reference drinking (heavily), I also knew he'd have a lot to say about the subject. Still going strong in the UK, I called Pat this past week right at pilsner time to have a chat about all things alcohol, as well as a few stories from the road. He didn't disappoint. 	<p />
	<p />In our conversation we talk international drinking competitions, the effectiveness of taxing liquor in Scandanavia, and the time that he and Alex Chilton went on an all-night spree through New Orleans. You can read the interview below.	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">David Driscoll: David J was gracious enough to be the intermediary between us and, speaking of him, he has a rather cryptic line in his book about a certain bus trip that was taken by him and the rest of The Jazz Butcher band through Europe during the mid-80s. He said his tolerance for drinking went way up after that journey. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Pat: I can't imagine that would be true.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What can you tell me about your time together on that ride?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	This was at the end of 1984 and what you have to understand about the trip was - for everyone in the group except David - it was the first time they'd ever played outside of England. So there we are, steaming into countries that I personally hadn't visited thus far; Holland and Germany. I knew nothing of these places at all. We got there and we were at a stage in what we jokingly call our "career" where we were being treated to hospitality at our English gigs. We very quickly discovered, however, that what we had experienced so far didn't even register on the scale of German hospitality. Obviously, being as it was our first time out there and that the Germans had been extremely nice to us, we went about our work with enthusiasm. Let's say that.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What is that like, living the schedule of the traveling musician? Playing a show, drinking all night, getting up, drinking some more? Do you need to prepare for it?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	The only way to really prepare for it is to have done it, I think. Unless you go out and make all those first tour mistakes then you'll never learn.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What are the mistakes that people generally make?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, they neglect to remember that when one drinks liquor, one is in a small way poisoning one's self. If one goes at it with too much enthusiasm and too much free vodka, over too many weeks - night, by night, by night - one will make one's self unwell. And quite possibly a bit paranoid!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What was it like for you when you first went out as a band? Did you have people wanting to buy you drinks after the show, or wanting to hang out?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Initially there weren't too many people trying to be our friends. On the very first trip to Germany I do remember trying to have my supper while an enthusiastic new admirer - male - was kneeling on the restaurant floor at my feet. That was a little tiresome. I said to my manager, "Can we lose this idiot?" He looked at me and said, "I'm having my dinner." And I said, "Yeah, me too. That's the point!" Actually, on that first trip in 1984 - apart from a run-in I had with a bottle of Cointreau on the ferry to Holland, which resulted in my entering Holland completely unaware of that fact - we were fairly restrained. In later years we got better at it.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Drinking plays a big part in your songwriting. It's clear when listening to The Jazz Butcher that you haven't had to get off the wagon. You still like to drink.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	The last record we made I said, "They're never going to stop me!"
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Do you see yourself as a professional drinker who happens to play music, or a professional musician who happens to drink?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I think of myself as a songwriter/musician who enjoys a drink. I drink every day. At my age - I'm in my mid-50s - I've heard enough stories about hardened drinkers who stopped drinking and went into a sort of shock heart attack and died. I would fear to go a day without any beer at all. I'd be frightened.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What are your favorites?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	My staple - which I take in large quantities every single day - would be pilsner. Ideally, actual geographically pilsner beer from the Czech Republic. Generally, I'll enjoy pilsner every evening, but every now and again one does make forays into the darker woods. When we were lads on the road we used to order up or be given loads and loads of quality vodka. But that sort of spirits drinking I'm just not up for anymore. I'm more of an occasional tippler when it come that stuff, but I do get sudden enthusiasms for obscure liqueurs from time to time. I used to drive the landlord of my local bar absolutely mad by insisting that he order them in. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">I think the more you enjoy drinking, the more curious you eventually get. You hear about something new, you want to try it. That's the nature of drinking for those who really like doing it.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I seem to have been familiar with various types of liquor from time immemorial. Oddly enough, on that first trip to Hamburg we did have a run in with something that none of us had ever encountered before, and that for the next eighteen months I personally believed to be a Hamburg specialty: Pineau des Charentes, but they just called it Pineau. Eventually I would make it down to the Charentes area by Bordeaux to see where they make it, but because we had only ever encountered it in this bar I labored under the misapprehension that Pineau was a Hamburger thing. This bartender would pour us these little shot glasses and that's the only real new spirit I can remember being introduced to in adult life. That, and Becherovka. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">So you enjoy the herbal liqueurs, too? The digestivos?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, I'm a bit of an after dinner drinker. Of course it's Champagne eyes and lemonade pockets, but one doesn't typically have a bottle of Green Chartreuse lying around the kitchen. But sometimes we'll push the boat out and get some Cointreau, or some Port at least. Do you know of a ridiculous little liqueur from somewhere near Naples called Strega?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Yes!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	We had a big phase with that. I made the big mistake of introducing my ex-girlfriend to it. She conceived such an enthusiasm for it that was allied only by her inability to handle drinking it (laughs). Lovely woman. Very amicable. But, oh that Strega. She got into that full force. It's a bit like Becherovka; they both, in my personal cosmology, fall under the term "poisoned gin".
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">(laughs) HA! Right, it's basically the same idea, but with sugar.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I'm also very fond of the obscure German Kümmel.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">All of these drinks are making a big comeback right now; the amari and herbal liqueurs. Cocktail culture is gobbling them up.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Last time I was in Dortmund - about two years ago - I went to a bar where they were handing out free glasses of Kümmel, in these beautiful, 18th century-like tiny glasses. And they were coming around for nothing.
	<p />
	That's a style of drinking that has never really caught on in the U.S. - the whole German thing of mixing beer with various shots of schnapps or digestive liqueurs. It seemed like it might make a run here in the Bay Area with the whole shot and a beer culture - replacing the whiskey for Fernet Branca - but that was more about getting fucked up, than adding to the enjoyment of the experience. I think it was more like a dare, rather than something most folks wanted to do. When I lived in Germany it wasn't something competitive. We would mix and match for hours.
	<p />
	<p />
	Right, every now and again the barman just comes around with a little free round of something. It's very festive. I'm not really a British style of drinker. I do not believe the purpose of drinking is to get drunk. I see getting drunk as an annoying side effect.
	<p />
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">I've never heard someone put it like that, but I completely agree (laughs). It's like when I'm full, but I want to keep eating.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Do you know what I mean? It's like, "Oh bollocks, now I can't drink anymore!"
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">That happened to me yesterday. I drank a whole bunch of wine and had reached my limit, but there was still an hour left in the movie I was watching. I was really annoyed because that meant I couldn't continue to drink for the rest of the film.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's a tricky thing sometimes. I think it's the culture of people who <em>don't</em> drink, isn't it? They think that the purpose of drinking is to get drunk. And I think some of it comes from Scandinavia, where they put a heavier tax on alcohol. If you ever visit the town of Lübeck on the Baltic Coast of Germany on a summer's afternoon, you'll find yourself stepping over the bodies of Swedish tourists who got on the boat over and had a run-in with German liquor prices. By the time they hit Germany itself they're unable to fucking walk. Of course they go home, they have the mother of all hangovers, they feel dirty and guilty and grimy, as one does after such an experience, and they conclude, "Ja, drinking is bad." So they stick another ten pounds on the price of a fucking pint, which only makes them go crazier the next time they step on the ferry.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Yeah, raising prices on alcohol doesn't discourage drinking, in my opinion. You can ask the NFL about that here in America. People just get shit-housed in the parking lot before the game instead of paying for expensive beer in the stadium.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's a fucking nightmare! And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. To me, that's what drives all this anti-drinking culture. They don't even say the words "have a drink," they say "use alcohol". You know? In that whiney little voice they use to see if you've understood the very basic concept they're trying to get across. "Have you been <em>using alcohol</em>?" O these people! I will outlive them, I swear! (laughs)
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Part of the reason I wanted to start this interview series was to help counteract extremes like this. Not so much the folks on the temperance side trying to curb drinking, but rather the extremes on the opposite view that try to take all the fun out of drinking by stressing too much appreciation. They're just as fanatical about not getting drunk, or drinking because it's fun to drink. To them it's all about flavor. You need to sip everything slowly all the time. That's not to say that I don't enjoy the flavor of alcohol, but let's not put on airs here. It seems more like they're trying to separate themselves from "common" drinkers and that's quite annoying to me. So if you and I are saying that drinking isn't about getting drunk, and it's not just about flavor, then what are we saying?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I am positively simple-minded about this. To me, the origins of drinking lie in quenching the thirst. This is why I'm such a pilsner fanatic. I seem to be a man who is simply cursed with a serious thirst. Both of my parents were that way. They came from an age that is represented in shows like <em>Mad Men. </em>"It's quarter past eleven? Let's have a gin and tonic in the office." They lived in that world. That's how business was done in London in the 50s and 60s. Today, the way they raised me would be described as child abuse. Someone today would probably shout, "They're feeding that child wine!" I was being given wine with dinner at the age of six. Once I left school all hell broke loose. I'd show up back home at about quarter to twelve in the morning and my mother would be there waiting for me, asking "gin and tonic?" It wasn't unpleasant for me. I knew it wasn't normal because my mates would come over and say, "Is it always like this?" But I was raised to have a high tolerance and it's possible I've got the genetic thirst. Some might frown on the way I was raised, but I'm 57 today and I'm not dead yet.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">My parents were always drinkers, too. Maybe not quite as proficient, but there was always a supply in the house. There are extremes in the way that people feel about alcohol and I fall somewhere into the middle. For example, I don't necessarily drink a lot of vodka, but I hate the people who shit on it simply because they claim it doesn't have any flavor. That just makes me want to roll my eyes and go drink with someone else who doesn't have all these silly hang-ups.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well that's where they reveal they've just got their snobbery going and aren't really talking sense. Of course vodka has flavor. I can bore you for hours about the subject of vodka.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Please do!

	<div class="iview_a">
	We drank it in the 80s chiefly because we could - as a band we were getting riders - and we drank it in part because we were little lefties. We thought vodka was cool, and whiskey wasn't.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">It's amazing how that's flipped around since then!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	But it's a good functional liquor. You can drink it straight or mix it with anything and no one's really against it, so it's good for groups. Touring around Germany, one had the option of getting one's hands on some really good vodka; the Duty Frees, and whatnot. We were exposed to a lot of good quality vodka in a very short amount of time. I'd say there was a big difference in flavor between the good and the bad.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What would you say if you were condescended to in a bar when you ordered a vodka drink, though? That's kind of what's happened in California over the last few years.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It is a bit like the comedian going into the bar, ordering a pint, and not getting any further. I'm very fond of Stolichnaya - it was a big part of my youth. For just regular guzzling vodka we would generally stick with Soviet produce, but I grew very fond of Polish vodkas as well - Wyborowa, particularly. We were once in New Hampshire, in 1986 would you believe, and we found the Wyborowa Black. The motto for New Hampshire is "Live Free or Die", you know, and they've got this massive liquor store right on the freeway with cheap prices, and as you drive on they've got this big billboard that says, "If you see someone drinking and driving call 1-800-HERO!!" We were in this store, however, and it tickled us to death because it resembled nothing more than the stores you would see on the motorway in East Germany. When you had to go to Berlin - it was an enclave, cut off, and you had to drive through East Germany - for a gig there you had to get visa-ed up, enter, and then drive on this special motorway. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">I've heard stories about that, yes.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	On the East German leg through Communist World, they had these service stations called Intershop (says with heavy accent). And Intershop was the love of our lives! Not only were we helping to maintain the class struggle, but they were selling Scotch whisky cheaper than anywhere in Scotland, and Marlboro cigarettes for cheaper than you could find them in Virginia. It was a hard currency grab. As long as you paid in Western currency they would sell it to you cheap. So when we saw the shop in New Hampshire we said, "Wow! This is great! They have them in America, too!" So I bought a bottle of this other Polish vodka and brought it back - because I thought it had this beautiful little box - and when I got home I pulled the bottle out and looked at the little tag around the neck. On there was a little message that said, "Thank you America for the potato." (says in Polish accent). I thought that was really sweet. Max and I ended up drinking the bottle of Wyborowa Black on the balcony of our hotel in Toronto and it was great.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">You guys just sipped it straight?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, I've always drunk my vodka straight. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">So you appreciate the different flavors, textures, and nuances of vodka?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah, you get up the Baltic way - you see it with Absolut - and the vodka's really syrupy and rich. It's not sweet, but there's a definitely difference in what people call mouthfeel. In our local Ukrainian club they have a Ukrainian cherry-flavored vodka that is absolutely delicious. You cannot have one glass. In fact, you cannot stop at all. But the hangover this bastard produces - you can feel the gravel in your stomach. I dare say the cherries were grown next to Chernobyl. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">You mentioned drinking vodka with Max Eider, your partner in The Jazz Butcher. Who are some other folks you ran into on the road that were as up for the challenge as you?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Occasionally, we'd have international drink-offs against the local staff or tour managers in the various countries we travelled to. We once beat France in Marseille 4-0. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">(laughs)
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	But we got killed by Hungary. We got absolutely shafted by Hungary (laughs). 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">What was the drink of choice for that particular challenge? 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Stoli. Their representative and ours - which was me - had a liter bottle of Stoil each. It was just brutal. There was no sophistication about this. I went into the dressing room after we had done the gig. I must have had about a third of the bottle in one go. I put it down, looking at this Hungarian tour manager - who was probably only about 24 - and I said, "There you go, son." But I was completely out of my league. He picked up his own bottle of Stoli and did the whole thing without stopping. An entire liter.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Jesus, that's like something out of a movie!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Our lot, they're all ferocious drinkers, but we were out of our league in Hungary. Other bands who like a drink? There was a terrible cultural collision - the ripples of which are still being felt around the world - when we met Camper Van Beethoven in Cleveland many years ago. Ultimate drunkeness. Ultimate "you're bloody family!" (says in loud slurring voice) "I bloody love you! Arghhh..." Absolutely flapping mental. We got on really well and we knew we would. We liked their music, they liked ours, and so when we met we knew it was going to be a party. My memories from then are like badly-taken 1970s Instamatic photographs. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">And those experiences build comradery. That's how you bond, right? You meet up after the show and you make friends over a drink.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I've accidentally joined a large number of bands that way! (laughs) Musicians, where do they work? They work in bars. They get there hours before the fans do, and what do they do? They hang around. It's inevitable that most musicians like a drink. It just passes the time.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Have you ever had to go on the road with people who don't drink or have cleaned up?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I've had run-ins with people like that, but I have a personal philosophy that has been in place since I reached the age of forty, and it's a very simple question: why work with people you don't like? You could like someone, but if they got on one of those "put that cigarette out" tips, you would have to behead them! (laughs) I'm largely an ethical person simply for pragmatic reasons. It's like the advice that Alfred Hitchcock gave the Hollywooders when they assembled to hear him give a speech once. He told them a story about being caught by a policeman on someone else's bike when he was seven. He told a lengthy story and at the end of it, he said (doing Hitchcock impersonation): "So this is my advice to you. Stay out of prison." 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">That's good advice!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	So I followed that advice, and I know that if you always tell the truth you don't have to remember anything. And the other one I follow, of course: why work with people you don't like? With the first lineup of The Jazz Butcher we just went out and we didn't expect to ever be so popular. We hadn't really made any ground rules and we didn't really have any experience. But once the second lineup came together, we didn't all know each other that well, so we built rules for touring together. It was called the Rennes Accord because we came up with it in a pub in Rennes. We had to put some thought into it.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">So you had to think about drinking a lot when dealing with others. I think about drinking all the time and the hang-ups people have concerning it. I think about why we drink, and funny stories that happen when we do. Happiness. Jokes. Or in your case, you write clever songs.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Right! Well if you don't enjoy it, you really should find something else to be doing, shouldn't you? If you're playing tennis and you hate playing tennis, then you should put that racquet down and play something else. It all seems very simple to me. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Who's someone you haven't had a drink with that you might want to have one with?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Wow. To some extent I've already had the experience. In 1992, when we drove the bus to New Orleans, Alex Chilton was down there to bury his brother. Our tour manager had had a few recent encounters with him and said, "Alex is coming to the show tonight, but don't buy him any beers because he's off the booze." So we did the show, and afterward Alex shows up in the dressing room and helps himself to a beer. We leave the dressing room and he takes us out to some bars, and then some clubs, and then some more bars, and we get home at like seven o'clock in the morning. For the most part he was just Gentleman Jim, drinking his beer, showing us the town. No problems. So I get to bed at stupid o'clock, wake up in the afternoon, grab a bite to eat, and I'm walking back to the hotel feeling like death. You know that thing that happens when you walk past the local bar, and your mate's in there, and he sees you, bangs on the window, and kind of beckons you in? 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">Yes! (laughs)
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	So it's 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon and Alex fucking Chilton is sitting in a pub in New Orleans, banging on the window, and beckoning me in. Well, of course, there's only one rational response to something like that. 
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">You go in.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	So we embarked on round two. I'm sure there are an awful lot of talented people that I'd love to sit down and have a drink with, but, to be fair, a 48-hour New Orleans drinking binge with Alex Chilton? I'll understand if I don't get anything more than that.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	That sounds amazing. A lot of guys I work with are Big Star fans. They'd love to hear that story.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	We ended up in a transvestite Cowboy bar. Who would have thought that such a place even existed?

	 <p />Pat Fish has no use for modernity. The singer/songwriter and leader of the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (or Jazz Butcher, depending on the album) is doggedly idiosyncratic in his approach to music, following his own path and no one else’s. After a long career that has seen varying degrees of success and a few masterpieces, one could forgive Fish if he were to get a bit sardonic in his old age. Yet, <i>The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers</i> is not as cynical as that. The album, now released to the public after a fan-funded limited pressing, casts Fish as a weary-yet-amicable traveler, a man who has seen it all and is more than happy to tell you what he’s learned.	<p />
	<p />The dynamism of past releases like the brilliant <i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i> is nowhere to be found on <i>The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers</i>, but that’s probably for the best. Fish is too wise of a songwriter to try and recapture past glories. Instead, his songs here are more meditative than one would expect. Even more rollicking tracks like “Shame About You” have a fairly easygoing bent. Aside from “Solar Core,” which is the closest Fish has come to writing a straightforward rock song, the Jazz Butcher remains a mostly subdued ensemble throughout.	<p />
	<p />Lyrically, Fish remains focused on the misfits and booze-soaked weirdos that have always popped up in his work over the years, but they appear here with a sense of resignation about them. The speaker of the title track laments a world that seems to have passed him by, yet he refused to give in and get with the times. On “All the Saints", Fish’s venom stings the most as he wonders how the risk-averse self-chronicling Internet generation can ever truly experience life. Rather than try to chase youth, Fish seems quite comfortable with where he is now.	<p />
	<p />He also sounds more comfortable on a six-string than ever. <i>The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers</i> is, somewhat surprisingly, very much a guitar-focused album. Fish was always an incomparable talent, but he and fellow Jazz Butcher Max Eider put on a show. Their work recalls some elements of Richard Thompson, though Fish is far less influenced by traditional folk. Instead, his languid playing on “Shame About You” could best be characterized as a jazz-rock hybrid with fewer unnecessary fireworks, while his work on “Black Raoul” is almost as threatening and enticing as the title character.	<p />
	<p /><i>The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers</i> doesn’t aim to please everyone, and it’s arguable that Pat Fish doesn’t have much left to prove in music. Rumors are that this will be the last Jazz Butcher album, though that - like everything to do with the band - is subject to Fish’s whims. If this is to be the final bow of the Jazz Butcher, it’s a fittingly dignified exit. Its pleasures slowly unfold with repeated listens as you catch previously unheard licks or mis-remembered turns of phrase. In short, it’s the Jazz Butcher doing what they do best, and that’s almost certainly worth giving a try.	<p />

	Last of the Gentleman Adventurers
	is something of an obscure, possibly final, album in the decades-spanning Jazz Butcher canon. The record was initially self-released in 2012 as a result of a Kickstarter-like campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the group. However, that initial pressing was limited to just 1,000 copies — and, naturally, those discs quickly sold out. Well, here comes Fire Records to the rescue, putting the album back in print, and, this time, on a global and much larger scale. (Not only that, but Fire also has plans to release two career-spanning box sets eventually.) For those not familiar with the Jazz Butcher, the band is/was a venture for English singer-songwriter Pat Fish, whose fan base might not be particularly huge, but it appeared to boast lauded comic-book author Alan Moore, who actually wrote the original liner notes for
	Last of the Gentleman Adventurers
	. The group made its mark in the ’80s and early ’90s before calling it a day in 1995, though further albums — including this one — followed. It remains to be seen if this release is indeed the final curtain bow for the Jazz Butcher, but putting it in the hands of fans first was a lovely parting (of sorts) gesture.
	<p />
	<p />
	So what to make of this album? Well, I feel this is either starting to become a cliché in my writing, or it may just reflect the overall tenor of releases that I’ve been getting for Music 2016’s first quarter, but this is probably an album best suited for the night-time. It’s not really jazz, though there are jazz-lite textures. That’s another way of saying, though, that Fish and company don’t really rock out too much — the lone exception on this disc being the inflammatory “Solar Core”, which is about as fiery as the title sounds and really gets cooking when Fish hits the refrain of “the blues ain’t nothing.” Otherwise, this album is a pretty low-key and laconic affair. Maybe chalk it up to Fish’s nearly 60 years of age. It’s pretty and soothing, but it doesn’t do much more than that. Probably best suited for closing hours at the British pubs,
	<p />
	<p />
	Last of the Gentleman Adventurers
	doesn’t boast much in fire power — which also means that it doesn’t have a lot of stickiness or staying power, either. Still, it’s pleasant when it needs to be and captures the essence of a Briton who has spent a lifetime or two at the foot of the bar. If that suits you, then this album is what you need — whether it be to unwind or relax or just get you through whatever ails you. This is worth investigating, but it really just sets the stage for those forthcoming box sets, which might be more blistering in approach.

	<p />Pat Fish, only somewhat more famously known as The Jazz Butcher, passed away a year ago today, October 5, 2021, peacefully in his sleep by all accounts. This was the day I learned I belonged to a secret society, one so obscure and scattered that it kept my own membership in its ranks a hidden fact for over 30 years.	<p />
	<p />Truth be told, I was not alone. All around me, people were realizing that this inexplicable, even solipsistic, obsession with an English musician whose heyday has long passed (“wow, that’s some ’80s shit, no?” exclaimed a friend) was in fact shared by many others. I would always be quick to profess my love for the Butcher, but I’d never done a full accounting of his music’s constant presence in my life, from the near-daily playing of classics like “D.R.I.N.K.” and “Just Like Betty Page” on my ukulele with morning coffee to the occasional urge to listen to something very specific like “Bicycle Kid” or <em>A Scandal In Bohemia</em> from start to finish. In the last few years, there was also Pat’s own presence in my social media, which we’ll get to in a bit.	<p />
	<p />Like many of my fellow secret society members, it all started in those heady days of alternative music. I was relatively late to the party, drawn in by the recent release of <em>Big Planet Scarey Planet</em> and its presence in the bins of the college radio station I had just joined. Digging into the back catalog revealed a few years’ worth of releases, overall a shambolic mess, like someone broke two vases and they glued everything back up and ended with three. A significant portion of these records were on scrappy UK labels with little or no distribution in the US, a common occurrence at the time which made finding them an adventure of its own. Having to fit in trips to the indie record stores in a city you were visiting in order to scour the used and import bins for releases like the Jazz Butcher’s was something that felt like a pain in the ass at the time, but which in retrospect was one of the most rewarding activities I ever took on.	<p />
	<p />This is my story, but it matches that of other members of the secret society. College radio, a record store performance, a cassette stolen from a girlfriend, the crossover connection with fellow Northampton bands like Love and Rockets and the Spacemen 3, some head-spinning accidentally attended live show, we all have had our separate introductions, but the relationship has been consistently the same.	<p />
	<p />There are many artists with a dedicated niche following, but what made The Jazz Butcher unique was the reciprocity. Long before MySpace roared into the scene in the Oughts, Pat Fish had one of the earliest fan-run websites out there, dating back to 1994. Prior to that, he had already established a far-ranging analog social network via phone call, mail, fax, what have you. He would play intimate mis-booked live gigs. He would play your wedding, and remember your spouse’s name, and message you every year on your cat’s birthday. A digital platform was just an easier way for him continue what he loved to do: engage with often-shocked but always appreciative fans on a very genuine and personal level.	<p />
	<p />Eventually, he made a home on Facebook, where he was known to personally friend anyone with a clever post or comment on the Jazz Butcher fan page, then like a picture of your houseplants or weigh in on your post asking about the best live album. This charm and engagement went far beyond tapping out some keystrokes now and then; Pat Fish was unusually generous with his time. The world was an endless buffet of creative opportunity for him, and he would easily engage in any project that caught his fancy, from adding a guitar part to a recording to trying his hand at writing a short story. He would deliver far and beyond what was promised, before you had a chance to wonder if you were being taken seriously.	<p />
	<p />In June 2020, like many other housebound musicians, he began streaming from his home, live from Fishy Mansions. The recording is far from perfect, and in fact is endearingly naïve. The phone vibrates whenever a text message comes in, making an unwanted arhythmic accompaniment to the performance. The fans are asking what that constant drilling sound is, but Pat and his feed wrangler, unseen in the camera, can’t seem to figure it out, though they have some good hypotheses. Pat takes another sip of his pint. At one point, he asks how many people are watching, and is genuinely startled to hear it’s over 300. A watcher has to ask about tips and donations before it occurs to the talent that this whole thing could be monetized. We get a glimpse of Camper Van Beethoven’s “We Saw Jerry’s Daughter,” and the show closes with “Take The Skinheads Bowling” … all in all, a rousing success and a great start to a series of streaming shows.	<p />
	<p />I never got to see The Jazz Butcher live and in person, with the Conspiracy or otherwise. Opportunities were few and far between, but too many to justify missing all of them, and it’ll remain an uncrossed item on my list. However, enough vivid memories were surfaced and retold by others in the wake of his passing that I can describe how it would have gone, in great imaginary detail:	<p />
	<p />We manage to catch up with the Butcher himself and some of the band before the show, purely by happenstance, and the next thing we know, we are all partaking in drinks, conversation, and some of that jazz lettuce. The show that night is amazing, we’re standing a couple of rows back from the stage and they’re playing all my favorites. Pat deals with some equipment mishap with wit and panache before diving right back into the thick of it. The stage is swirling with noise and mayhem when I feel an elbow gently nudging my ribs. It’s Pat, a pint glass in each hand. He hands one over to me, and we wordlessly toast. He looks around at the crowd approvingly, before catching his own eye on stage and receiving a broad wink in return. The band starts rolling through the chords of the closing encore, and as we hear “Every day, I get up and pray to Jah…” from the stage, Pat laughs and melts away into the crowd. It was the best show.	<p />
	<p /><em>The Jazz Butcher’s final album, “The Highest In The Land,” was released posthumously in February 2022.</em>	<p />

	<p />If there's one bad thing I can say about the Internet, it's that it seems to have eliminated the curious joy of shopping a record store in a new town for the rare appearance of a vinyl import of that Jazz Butcher single. If there's one good thing I can say is that now you can own whichever Jazz Butcher album you want, as long as you're willing to put down the cash.	<p />
	<p />But if you're new to the Jazz Butcher and unwilling to pay for that rare first pressing of <I>Fishcotheque</I>, <I>Draining The Glass</I> is a good place to start. This anthology collects tracks from the Jazz Butchers' earlier incarnation, which in retrospective features the clever arrangements of '80s Britpop acts like the Smiths with the psychedelic dark humor of Robyn Hitchcock. Still, the band was its own complex beast, with Pat Fish (aka the Jazz Butcher) and his strong croon easily recognizable features.	<p />
	<p />The twenty tracks here highlight the range the band possessed, from the spiky slash of "Marnie" to the Tin Pan Alley-sounding "D.R.I.N.K.". The jazzier moments are clearly audible in the sensible and sardonical "Partytime" ("This is party time / and it's good to drink for free when you haven't any money / This is party time / and it's better than a cold bath with someone you dislike"), or the tiki-twilight tones of "The Human Jungle." The darker moments come in the form of the thrumming "Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present," apparently made from the skin of dead Jim Morrisons. In between we get moments of genuine British pop, like "Big Saturday," with its chiming guitar line or the reverberation of "Girlfriend." And there are songs like "President Reagan's Birthday Present," with a slow insinuating build-up and a hypnotic "the Russians shot my rocket down" chorus.	<p />
	<p />Perhaps that's the reason that the Jazz Butcher seems to be largely neglected by most, and largely appreciated by a small but fervent fan base. The all-over-the-place nature of the music on here is somewhat unsettling at first (later output was a bit more musically consistent, if just as twisted) but the style is clearly unique to the Jazz Butcher. Together with <i>excellent!</i> (which contains latter-day material), it's a virtual roadmap of a long-time favorite.	<p />

Gentleman Adventurer Pat Fish (a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher) founded the group by that name (also known as The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy and The Jazz Butcher And His Sikkorskis From Hell) with Max Eiderin in 1982. The band’s debut in Bath of Bacon was released by Glass Records in 1983. A second album A Scandal in Bohemia, also on Glass, featured guest appearances from David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, old mates of Pat’s. After four albums, and two singles collections for Glass, Fish signed to Creation Records in 1988, releasing eight albums on the label, culminating in 1995’s Illuminate. This was followed by Rotten Soul (Vinyl Japan, 2000) and 2012’s masterful volume, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, featuring greats like the title track, or Pat’s ode to his cat, “Black Raoul”. Fish recently spoke with Zack Kopp regarding the scope of his career so far, and its likely direction from here.
	<div class="iview_q">
First let me say I’ve been a fan since Bloody Nonsense came to my attention as a teenager in 1986. “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present”, in particular, made a huge impression. An album called Big Questions ended up becoming my favorite, and your latest, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers was a real work of art and greatly appreciated by this listener. I don’t know how it did in any charts, but I hope you made millions or broke even.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
It’s funny that Big Questions should mean so much to someone. It was very much a final scrape of the barrel in terms of the stuff that we recorded for Glass. I can’t even remember being involved in the track selection. Yet Glass Supremo D. Elvis Barker, with his impeccable taste, managed to turn this grab-bag of out-takes, contributions to one-off compilations and ill-advised cover versions into something really rather listenable.
	
	<p />
I’m glad you like Last of the Gents. I’m quite proud of that one myself. We made it to mark the band’s thirtieth anniversary and we were incredibly lucky to have our friends Richard Formby, Tim Harries and Jonny Mattock for that session. They are all busy men and I could not believe our good fortune when we found a window to work with all three of them. We raised the money for that project with a crowdfunding campaign. People were incredibly generous and before we even entered the studio there was enough money to cover recording, travel, accommodation, mastering and manufacturing. When we did the deal with Fire Records for the re-release of our catalogue we made it conditional upon their doing CD and vinyl versions of Last of the Gents, so it continues to sell.
	
	<p />
For a small band like ours, there’s not much money to be made from record sales. The money, such as it is, is in the writing and publishing. That said, I’m proud to be able to say that none of our albums ever made a loss.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
You’ve played in David J.’s band(s), and he in yours, and I heard you met at art school, is that right? How’s it been working with him and being friends through the years of changing music trends? What were your teenage roots, musically speaking?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
David was at art college here in Northampton, whereas I went to university in Oxford. Although I had seen Bauhaus a few times as a paying punter, I didn’t know David at the time I met his brother (Bauhaus drummer) Kevin first, just socially, when I moved to Northampton and we got on well. I finally got to meet David at Kevin’s birthday party on a canal barge in the summer of 1983, just after Bauhaus had split up for the first time. The night was remarkable for one of the very few live appearances by the Sinister Ducks, David’s more than partially demented collaboration with Northampton’s own Alan Moore.

I have never actually played in a David J. band as such, though we have played together on stage a few times as guests at each other’s solo shows. Both Max Eider and Owen P. Jones have toured with him, however, and we all crop up here and there on his recordings. He’s been known to turn up and join in at Jazz Butcher shows too.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
Is this the Watchmen guy or a completely other Alan Moore? That’s an interesting connection.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
First off, yes, it’s that Alan Moore. He’s good friends with David J and has done a number of interesting collaborations with him over the years, including an EP based on Alan’s V For Vendetta, which has recently been re-released by Glass Modern in a luxurious new expanded format. The Ducks were Alan, David and Alex Green on sax, with artwork by Edwin Pouncey aka Savage Pencil. They released one 45 on Situation Two Records, probably in that very summer of 1983.
	
	<p />
Alan has lived all his life in Northampton and doesn’t much care to travel anywhere else. He has written two books (not comics) about the town: Voice of the Fire and the enormous, mind-boggling Jerusalem. He’s far from being the grumpy recluse that he is sometimes said to be. As his sleeve notes on Last of the Gents demonstrate, he’s always willing to help out a pal, but if anybody is struggling, Alan will be there for them. He is, in his own way, a proper pillar of the community. I love him.
	
	<p />
At the end of 1982 a very, very early manifestation of the Jazz Butcher had opened for Bauhaus at the Hammersmith Palais in London. After the show I thanked Kevin for the opportunity, only for him to deny all knowledge of how we had come to be there. It turned out that David had been observing us from afar, and it was he who had us added to the bill.
	
	<p />
Over the autumn of 1983, Max and I opened a run of shows for David in his capacity as a solo artist and we got on well. There was talk of his producing our second album. Things became complicated and by March 1984 David was our bass player. He stayed for two albums and a European tour before going off to start Love & Rockets with his old compadres. His studio experience with Bauhaus was invaluable; he taught us loads of useful things; not least how to get concert promoters to give you free drinks.
	
	<p />
At the time we met, David and I were into some very similar stuff. Obviously, we shared things like the Velvet Underground, Bowie and Eno, but there was also a shared enthusiasm for simpler, more classic singer-songwriters like Dylan, Peter Perrett, Nick Drake, Roddy Frame and Martin Stephenson. We used to trade cassettes all the time. I recall the wonderful moment where I sent him a ropey home recording of the Velvets’ “Stephanie Says”. It was only available on some grungy bootleg in those days and David hadn’t heard the song before, which led, delightfully, to his thinking that I had written it! A similar thing had happened when he brought John Cale’s Rosegarden Funeral of Soresto a Bauhaus rehearsal. All the other guys in the band thought David had written it; and for the longest time, he let them continue to believe that.
	
	<p />
I think, deep inside, that we both just wanted to be Cale.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
Can you say more about your appreciation of John Cale—what did you like about him especially?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
I think I probably came to Cale when I was about sixteen, through the fact that Eno produced his album Fear. Of course, I loved that record and I’ve followed Cale for the rest of my life. I was enjoying his solo stuff long before I “got” the Velvet Underground.
	
	<p />
I’ve never really taken a moment to ask myself why I like his work so much. I guess that it has something to do with the fact that although he loves to experiment and ‘push the envelope’, as they say, there always seems to be a strong, beautiful musical base to the work. His Music for a New Society is a fine example: the performances are deconstructed, fragmented even, as though blown to pieces by a cluster bomb flung casually through the studio window, but deep underneath, buried in the wreckage, are really strong, beautiful songs. Somehow, the fact that this beauty is poking up from a heap of smouldering rubble seems to amplify the emotional impact of the tunes.
	
	<p />
Cale has a very nice take on a sort of dignified, world-weary resignation: ‘Back in Berlin they’re all well-fed…but I don’t care. People always bored me anyway,’ he sings on Paris 1919’s “Half Past France” over a stately, disassociated drone of strings. Not bad for a young man still in his twenties. He even wears a white suit in the cover photographs. Impeccable!
	
	<p />
Another thing that I enjoy about Cale is that his songs are so good that they can be presented in even the simplest acoustic format and still have the impact that they might have had with a live band or an elaborate studio production. Obviously, I’ve seen him perform live on many occasions and with many different musicians, but the shows that have really reached me are the ones where he has performed alone with a guitar or a piano. As things turned out, I was lucky enough to open for him at one such show at the Forum in London in 1993.
	
	<p />
Great songwriting, beautiful music and paranoia teetering on the very brink of overt hostility: what’s not to like?
	
	<p />
Tale out of school: one evening in September 1983, not long after Bauhaus had split up, I wandered into my local dive bar to find David J doing an unadvertised solo performance in the back room. It was the first time that I had heard my new pal playing solo and I watched, fascinated, as he worked through tunes from his first solo album The Etiquette of Violence. After a few numbers I remarked to a friend “Well, it looks as though Dave’s going for the ‘John Cale of the Group’ ticket.” With that. I headed out to the lavatory. On my return, I walked into the room to find David halfway through a cover version of “Fear is a Man’s Best Friend”. Oh, how we laughed!”
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
Where are you these days, creatively? What impression would you most like to be making these days, as a creative exponent (to include social commentator, musician, and any other chosen themes)?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
Oddly enough, having just written that stuff about Cale, I fell to thinking about this question and realised that I do rather seem to be trying to follow in his footsteps to some degree. Even in the days when our stuff was considered borderline comical (and there was the occasional joke, I have to admit!) a lot of the songs were about disassociation, rejection and ‘walking away’. More recently, the lyrics have become more overtly ‘dark’ while the tunes have become simpler and more melodic. I’m on record as saying. ‘What I do is not entertainment.’ People can take that as they will.
	
	<p />
Because there is very little work out there for an act like mine, and therefore very little money, I can’t currently afford to keep a full-time band, so the vast majority of my live performances are solo affairs. One ends up with a single elderly, not very photogenic gent with a guitar, playing pretty tunes with sour, disassociated lyrics. Top ten material it is not.
	
	<p />
The Cale influence, then, is still very much in effect, as is the lingering influence of his old band mate Lou. I love classic soul music (as did they) and that is becoming more and more of an influence on my songwriting too. My guitar sound owes much to both John Martyn and Syd Barrett. The attitude that I hope to convey owes much to the languid insouciance of Kevin Ayers, whose appearance on children’s tv singing Marlene Dietrich’s “Falling in Love Again” with a bottle of Champagne and an exploding piano blew my teenage mind.
	
	<p />
Grace under pressure? A warm heart in a cold world? Or the sound of an enormous steel door in Hell clanging shut forever?* It’s really not for me to say.
	
	<p />
I understand this lockdown is making people who live in part by public appearances rethink their next steps. I don’t really dig the virtual thing as a substitute for live stuff, but I’m about to shoot some vids of me reading shorts and link to a Patreon page to see what happens. What are you gonna do next as a performer?
	
	<p />
Just as the “lockdown” started, I saw some bloke with a guitar advertising his “live” gig on Facebook. There was a photo of this unprepossessing geezer with an acoustic guitar and, behind him, a large, home-made poster screaming ‘PAYPAL ME!!!’ I shuddered at the grasping vulgarity of it.
	
	<p />
So I’m having trouble going down the route of “virtual” shows. I have, however, been very taken with Max’s way of doing things, which is simply to record a number at home, then park it on the YouTubes and let people watch it for free. I intend to do something along similar lines over the next few days. Not that it will be in any way liable to cheer people up in their time of isolation. That’s just not where I’m at these days. (Insert evil cackle here.)
	
	<p />
It’s pretty frightening to think about the immediate future. To be honest, I have already depended much on the kindness of friends and strangers over the past year or so, but one cannot decently rely on that being an endless resource. I’ve no idea as to when it will be safe to go back to work (I think that live arts events are likely to be the very last things to come back), but when I do emerge, I think that I shall probably head straight back into the recording studio. I’m lucky enough to have people still interested in releasing my shit, so that would seem to be the best plan. And yes, there are songs.”
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
The Brian Wilson references in the beautiful song, “Shakey”, on Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers caught my attention, as a fan of his—what inspired them, if anything particular?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
“Shakey” was one of those songs that came really quickly. I think the lyric was pretty much a question of free association. I was, I think, trying to explore a landscape of personal devastation. Brian’s horrible childhood and the resultant misery and paranoia of his later years seemed a good fit. His wife really did find him chopping out powders with his two school-age daughters one Christmas morning. It don’t get much more devastated than that. Of course, the trick then is to point out in the chorus that for us mere mortal types, even this desperate nadir is way beyond our pay grade. ‘Let it go, boy. You can’t afford it.’ Bleak.
	
	<p />
I never really identified with the ‘social commentator’ thing, any more than I did with the asinine ‘Monty Python of rock’ label with which some deaf people tried to saddle us back in the eighties. I do like songs about real things that are expressed in simple, colloquial language, stuff like the Waiting album by the Fun Boy Three, or, of course, Dylan. I suppose that this does mean that an element of ‘social commentary’ is inevitable much of the time and, obviously, I do have my own opinions about things, but the social commentary thing is not what drives my songwriting. I’m not Billy Bragg, even though (fact fans!) he and I were born in the same city on the very same day.
	
	<p />
As I have watched my musical and (counter) cultural heroes die off over the last decade, I have come to feel that there is a certain responsibility upon those of us left behind, however mediocre we might be in comparison. It’s simply not good enough any more to have a laugh and a knees-up while the adults take care of the serious shit; like it or not, we (that is to say: our generation of writers and artists) are the adults now. I feel that if one’s not prepared to take on a little of that responsibility, then there’s not much point in trying to make art. I suppose what I’m trying to say is this: if you’re not doing shit that moves people and means something, sit down and be quiet.

A quick shout out to some of my other favourite artists who are still out there doing it right: Bob Dylan; Peter Perrett; Dave Kusworth; Patti Smith; Chuck D.; Tom Waits; Sonic Boom; Tinariwen; Vic Godard; Phil Parfitt; Rolo McGinty; Steve Savale and the Asian Dub Foundation; Tim Keegan; Robert del Naja and the Massive Attack collective; Micky Greaney; Mavis Staples . . . and, of course, John Cale and David J. Haskins.

	Pat Fish (aka the Jazz Butcher) and his partner in musical crime Max Eider were somehow convinced to play a
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1997/Sep19.html">September 19, 1997 wedding reception</a>.
	<p />
	They did so with aplomb (any dues-paying musician can testify that wedding reception crowds aren’t the most, um, “receptive”) and put on a superb show full of wit, humor and wonderful playing. And someone (of course) made a fine recording of the show.
	<p />
	This is a full band (complete with bass and drums), and kazoos fill in for trombones and such as needed. If you’re at all a fan of the Jazz Butcher, this recording is Not To Be Missed.
	<p />
	If you’re not among the converted, become so and check back. Enough said. By the way, they’re not jazz, and they don’t butcher the music. They’re clever English poppers, sort of a Robyn Hitchcock with a sense of humor instead of just plain weirdness.

The death last year of Pat Fish caught so many of us off-guard. Only 63, the legendary front-man of The Jazz Butcher, was taken far too early, with so much yet to do. In recent years, with a slate of reissues, the profile of The Jazz Butcher had only grown. The act that seemed utterly unlike lots of their peers on Creation Records was finally getting the sort of attention that they'd always deserved. And the material was getting treated with respect by Fire Records as the albums were re-released.
<p />
And while all of us were looking backwards, mourning the loss of Fish and playing that music again, the folks at Tapete were prepping a new Jazz Butcher album. The Highest in the Land, out tomorrow, was recorded over the last few years of Pat Fish's life, but it crackles with a playfulness and wit that makes it feel as if the songwriter is still alive. It's a vibrant record, but a poignant listen, obviously. Still, for fans of the Pat Fish, this is a sort of modest classic.
<p />
Relatively simple in style, and intimate in execution, The Highest in the Land finds Fish and crew addressing the malaise of England in a post-Brexit, Boris Johnson era. What could be dreadfully morose, is funny and spry. "Running on Fumes" bounces forward, with lyrics as sharp as ever for Fish, while the broader "Melanie Hargreaves' Father's Jaguar" uses a jazz vibe to riff on class in England, with Fish sounding a tiny bit like mid-era Momus briefly. Elsewhere, "Sebastian's Medication" looks again at the current woes of the U.K., while the peppy "Time" mourns the passing of time with an urgency that suggests Fish was likely to have had a longer spell of creativity had he lived. The absolutely heartbreaking "Goodnight Sweetheart" closes the album with a directness and sweetness that's just wonderful. For those who grew up on the wry wit of early Jazz Butcher sides, this heart-on-the-sleeve thing suits Fish so well that a listener just feels so cheated by Pat's early death. I know my friend of more than three decades and site contributor Stan Cierlitsky felt the same way, if not more so.
<p />
And that makes reviewing The Highest in the Land a hard thing to do. One imagines if Pat Fish was alive, how much fun he'd have with the attention this is surely going to get, and how he'd have enjoyed playfully running through these songs in concerts, or doing interviews with a dash of wit perpetually. This is a really fine final chapter in the life of one of the best songwriters of the last four decades.
<p />
The Highest in the Land is out on Friday via Tapete.

	It hasn't even been a half-year since the folks at dropped the first superb box-set from The Jazz Butcher, and now they are at it again. The Violent Years is out tomorrow and it collects 4 separate mid-Eighties and early-Nineties records from the band, from the near-perfect Fishcoteque (1988) and on to 1991's odd Condition BlueFire Records. The music here is, unsurprisingly, largely essential. And for every bizarre turn that Pat Fish drives the band into near the end of this set, there are loads more up-front that should still thoroughly charm and delight fans of mid-Eighties British indie.<br/>
	<br/>
	Fishcoteque (1988) kicks off with the rollicking "Next Move Sideways" before things drift into the languid Fall-isms of "Out of Touch", one of the highlights here. Elsewhere, the charging "Looking for Lot 49" stands as one of the very best, easiest-to-like numbers ever composed by Mr. Pat Fish, while "Swell" is downright lush and lovely. Sure, there are a few minor missteps here ("Susie", "Chickentown"), but, on the whole, Fishcoteque is ever bit as good as I remembered, and surely one of the better, more solid albums overall in the Jazz Butcher back-catalog.<br/>
	<br/>
	The more adventurous Big Planet, Scarey Planet from 1989 sees the band offer up more straightforward numbers than on earlier records, with standouts here being the first 2 songs on the record ("New Invention", "Line of Death"). Elsewhere, the fellas in The Jazz Butcher positively cut loose on the roughly-unhinged "The Word I Was Looking For", while the spry "Bad Dream Lover" almost makes up for the silliness of "Do The Bubonic Plague" and the various ill-considered sound-bites peppered throughout this release which only date the record to its era of origin when heard now.<br/>
	<br/>
	Disc 3 of The Violent Years is given over to 1990's Cult of the Basement, a record that hasn't aged nearly as well as the first 2 records in this set, and that's despite containing one of the band's absolute best songs. "She's on Drugs" positively chimes with its distillation of the band's love of wry humor and sharp hooks. If not everything here is as good, at least some of this is exceptional. "Girl Go" is a pretty good example of front-man Fish's ease with a down-tempo number, while "Daycare Nation" is both astutely-observed in its lyrical concerns, and expertly composed in melodic terms.<br/>
	<br/>
	It is only on Disc 4 of The Violent Years that a long-time fan of The Jazz Butcher may feel a tiny bit worn out. Condition Blue from 1991 saw Pat Fish fronting what was The Jazz Butcher in name only. And if so much of the band's greatness depended on Fish, it's clear here that he lost something when the other players moved to other projects. The tracks here are uniformly too long and a bit unfocused, but there are a few moments I enjoyed: the cute "Shirley MacLaine" and the ringing "She's a Yo-Yo", 2 clear highlights here on Condition Blue (1991). Still, what's on this final disc of The Violent Years is interesting if not compelling and, given the band's earlier enormously-endearing output before the release of this 1991 album, one can forgive them this early-Nineties diversion into sub-standard fare.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Violent Years is essential, of course, and I sure hope that my misgivings about portions of this don't make you hesitate purchasing this fantastic box-set. Much like the work of Robyn Hitchcock, the tunes of Pat Fish always deserve attention. And if Fish's stuff near the end of this disc seems more diffuse than earlier, sharper compositions, at least it's still Fish at the helm. That guarantees that this is already better than lots of what was being produced in the wilds of a pre-Britpop England.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Violent Years is out tomorrow via Fire Records. More details on The Jazz Butcher via the band's official Facebook page, or the band's official website.

	England's The Jazz Butcher were one of those bands who got lumped in with the C86 explosion, the flowering of Creation Records talent -- (the first or second ones, at least) -- and who knows what other wave of another set of bands. Despite that hard to pin down-ness, The Jazz Butcher make witty, heartfelt indie of the sort that has rewarded listeners for 30 years so far. The esteemed Fire Records outfit has now begun an impressive Jazz Butcher re-issue project with the first release being 2012's The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers.
	<p />
	Out today on Fire Records, the album is a delight. If the band has mellowed a tiny bit with age, the music and lyrics here are still as elegant and snappy as they always were. So it's safe to say that Pat Fish and his crew have rarely sounded better.
	<p />
	"Shame on You" rings with the sort of jangle that the best jangle rock bands perfected in an earlier era. That the music of Pat Fish and Max Eider predated that term says a lot and it would be perhaps unfair to label this music so easily. Similarly, the languid title cut and the insinuating "Count Me Out" beguile a listener with something beyond just simple alt-pop charms, while "All The Saints" reminds one of the best Wreckless Eric or Joe Jackson cuts but with better guitar-work throughout. Things are somewhat subdued in spots on The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers but it's appreciated when the material is as strong as "Saints Prayer" or "Shakey" which captivate with the hint of real jazz throughout both. Recalling both Grant McLennan and Robert Forster solo albums, The Last of the Gentleman Adventurers (2012) is a perfect example of how to do smart indie that doesn't belabor its smarts. Like those ex-Go-Betweens, Pat Fish, Max Eider, and the rest of the players in The Jazz Butcher have a sense of their own talents. That this set of material is so strong, even if a bit down-tempo, helps too.
	<p />
	Look, despite being a fan of this band from nearly 30 years ago, and being on the 'Net as it were, I somehow didn't know about this record until fairly recently and that's sad. This is a beautiful album that should reward long-time fans of The Jazz Butcher, or simply new fans who appreciate an expert blending of chamber pop and indie rock.

	<b>Pat</b>: That's right. Because when we travel and play, it's a kind of Peak Experience. And the memories stay.

	This album is like a coming back. How do you think people have taken it?
	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">
	Well, it's been very pleasing for us, the response.  We did it with crowd-funding on the Internet. And that.. we were kind of scared, you know, the money wouldn't come.  And, in fact, we have the money to make the L.P. by bed-time that night. It took a day. So, that was nice. We pick a lot of our favorite people to work with, that was good.  And it was just a pleasant little project, you know?
	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">
	This is a very good album, it has your identity, it has a little bit of everything. And, what do you feel about it?

	<p class="iview_a">
	I sort of agree, actually.  (laughing)
	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">
	You have a French song on the album. Why is that?
	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">
	Ah, well (laughing).  A long, long, long time ago, we wrote a song called La Mer. And that was in French.  And we were talking about the idea of maybe.. re-recording that, and trying to put out a record for French people.  So, I thought "we need a B-side".  And.. I don't know much French.  The only thing I could think of was - my friend has just come from Bordeaux and he said that - when they're in Bordaeux and they've had a few too many, they say 'ah.. Tombé dans les pommes" and I thought: "ok! title!"

	Is he a life-long friend even with the issue when you were young?

	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">
	(laughing) I'd say no.  I was talking on the way over, I once went to do a gig in Lisbon with the Bristol band Blue Aeroplanes, and at the time, their drummer was my old drummer, Paul Mulreany.  And, they got to Lisbon, they got drunk, and they had a massive argument. They were fighting each other.  And, we got back to England, and, like, they all hated each other.  And, we got back to England, we sat in a pub, and Paul the drummer just went into one like "it was much better in the Jazz Butcher's, Pat showed us some respect" (laughing)

	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">
	Do you still perform covers, in concert?
	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">
	Lots, yeah.  Some quite old.

	Are you still attracted to the electronic music?  Do you still experiment with it?
	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">
	I've kind of got that out of my system, now.  Yeah, I'm back with wood, now.  For about 10 years, I got into computer music.  But, then, I.. it's that thing - I went and bought a legitimate music software thing.  I bought a legal version of Cubase.  And as soon as I bought the proper one, it stopped working.  And I just said: "Ok, that's the sign. I understand".

	<h3>CAUTIONE - This is a robotic translation of the original Italian publication</h3>
	<div class="iview_intro">
	A heavy crisis hit in recent years the music industry, but there are comforting signs of recovery as the increase in vinyl sales or crowdfunding, which allows groups without a contract to collect money to cover the expenses of production. Released originally with this system October 18, 2012 in just 1,000 copies, "Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers" of the Jazz Butcher is now proposed (vinyl and digital versions, February 19, 2016) from the historic British indie label Fire Records, marking the return after a decade of one of those bands that in the early '80s animated the post-punk British. Lovers of the Velvet Underground and Jonathan Richman and led by a brilliant author like Pat Fish, The Jazz Butcher (the "Jazz Butcher") were perhaps a bit 'too "bohemian" to achieve massive success. Centered on Shakey, a tribute song Neil Young and Brian Wilson, the CD sees for the last time at work the guitar duo of Pat Fish and Max Eider, and is, needless to say, a small masterpiece. also a new album, tentatively titled "the Highest in the Land ", it is announced by the band on their official website for the autumn of 2016. the Fire Records finally is about to let out even a burst of beautiful reprints of Jazz Butcher, returning to the English band visibility which amply deserved. ( Giancarlo Susanna)
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Giancarlo Susanna (Distortion) - So Pat ... good music is always room in the lives of many people and the crisis seems at least partly retracted.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Pat Fish (The Jazz Butcher) - When Max Eider and I started the project we had no idea if anyone would help, but - very quickly - people have proven to be interested in music so far as to put their hands in their pockets and pay for it. Some have been incredibly generous in their support. PledgeMusic also gave us a great help. They have a good model for doing business in an era "post-label" and I would recommend them to all artists.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	What do you think of the reaction of those who bought the CD when you are done?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	We have not sought in any way to "promote" the album. We printed 500 copies to start with. People have bought so quickly that we could not take a few copies for the media. So we have no idea what they think the opinion-formers of our work (apart from you, of course!). From what I've seen on Facebook etc ... our supporters are not disappointed. It was a very encouraging response from our point of view ... and we printed another 500 copies ...
	<p />
	Britain has always been a reference point for those who make music, but that does not mean that it is very difficult to maintain significant visibility.
	<p />
	Britain today is a country where people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. In recent times for the musicians it was tough, but I simply do not know what else to do with my time so why stop?
	</div>
	 
	<div class="iview_q">
	Do you think an article on Jazz Butcher in one of the most influential music magazines could help?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	You can not say it. I have not even idea of what the influential publications. I must say that even twenty or thirty years ago the positive reviews in magazines are not always guaranteed good sales. If they had, I could dictate these answers to a secretary drinking cocktails by a pool.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Surely you know that two of your albums - "A Scandal in Bohemia" and "Fishcotheque" - are sold on the net to considerable sums. What do you think now of these two discs?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I can still hear them and sometimes it will take up a few songs in the concerts. Scandal ... it was the first real album that we made as a group and it was a great learning experience. Rivers have John as a producer and the experience of David J study was priceless. Fishcotheque reminds me of some great memories of crazy days in a very interesting area of London. Buster Edwards, "the great fishco train robber ", one day he offered me a brandy. It was that kind of session.
	I did not check the prices of our recently discs. In 2000, the Vinyl Japan has republished some, including Scandal. Before that, I know that prices on E-bay or similar sites were completely crazy. Some copies of our albums have been sold to more than one hundred dollars.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	The thing I love most in your songs is the fusion of sweetness and sense of humor, which is very present in this album.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	For a while 'my songs have been published by a company called Bittersweet Music, it was a beautiful name. I'm glad you still like what we do. When we started to collect the funds for the new record, we were not sure to find someone who is interested. A little anecdote: one evening we were playing in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A public type was chatting with our sound technician, Martin. He said: "I am in the military and a lot of people in my unit say that I should not like Jazz Butcher". "Absolutely right friend" replied Martin, "You fuckin 'LOVE THEM".
	<p />
	Perhaps Shakey is the song that explains everything: the years pass, but we are always here and "we are always dangerous."
	<p />
	The title is of course Neil Young, a man who seems to become every passing year more brightly upset. I have no idea how I can do it! There are many things that take place in the verses of this song, but a part of what I wanted to say is that, with so many great founders of rock and soul dead in recent years, there is a bit 'of responsibility for those of us who are still here to come forward, "becoming serious" and make music that is worth listening to.
	</div>
	 
	<div class="iview_q">
	Whose idea was it reprints?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	The Fire was determined to recover the disks of Creation and republish them. I told them that they had encountered by chance in a band that was working (the Quartet). I added that if they wanted to make reprints, had to entrust to us and publish Last of the Gentleman Adventurers on vinyl. I see this record as the bridge between our old things and the way we are today. They said they were in agreement and Last released in February on vinyl.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Will come out on vinyl and on CD?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I think the Fire wants to make two box sets, one with the Glass material and one with disks of Creation. Right now I'm afraid I can not say what they're doing. What we now see did not do is play live. There is talk of a European tour and this would make me really happy.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Meanwhile Max has decided to leave the group. What will you do?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It would not make much sense to try to "replace" Max Eider with another guitarist. This is not a "reunion" or a "return." It is not a bunch of old people who try to recreate their youth. It 'a band that happened to come together by chance. Already before Max had decided not to play more live we were rehearsing with Simon Taylor on trumpet. When Max decided to leave, Simon came ... not really what the public could expect.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	You may once again explain to our readers what it means The Jazz Butcher?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I do not remember how many times we were forced to explain that "we do not do jazz and does not download We eat meat. " It's the stupidest name you can imagine, do not you think? I think we wanted to make fun of some of the ridiculous names that chose the groups of the early '80s. We had no idea that we would have made a record under this name, let alone to make, hack and play at the international level after thirty years. As I've said before, it's a funny old life.

	<h3>CAUTION - This is a robotic translation of the original Croatian publication</h3>
	During a rich and long career, the British musician Pat Fish, he has collaborated with a number of bands and other musicians, but over the years, he remained faithful to his first alter ego, The Jazz Butcher. Under this name for the first time appeared in public in Oxford 1982. Years later, he appeared under the names of The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy and The Jazz Butcher And His Sikkorskis From Hell, but the initial part is always maintained. 
	<p />
	Similar to the suffix name of the band, have changed and band members. Through The Jazz Butcher passed many, who now play or have played in bands such as Levitation, The Woodentops, Dead Can Dance, Goldfrapp and so on. Also, The Jazz Butcher, many of today's musicians cited as role models to the beginnings of his career. 
	<p />
	The most fruitful part of the career of the band was in the mid-80s to early 90s, where they were a complete alternative to the then neoromantičarima, but despite that they managed to maintain and expand its audience. Their music was then, as now, adorned style that is, one might say, "evergreen", because it is unique and can not be put in a drawer, and is close and forget about it. But those who remember Prefab Sprout, The Go-Betweens or early the Fall, they will remember and the Jazz Butcher. 
	<p />
	So on their albums always found all kinds of things, and here it is. 
	<p />


	Animals With us fine smoky jazzy sound introduced in the album, which continues a fine pop float down the river (Shame About You) and fine nalsovnom pop Sporić (Last of the Gentleman Adventurers). A touch of French chanson brings Tombe dans les pommes, but more or less in that an alt pop sound we come to slow beachboysovske Shakey, and finally blueserske Solar Core and spooky Saints Prayer, which helped Sonic Boom (Spacemen 3). 
	<p />
	Otherwise, "Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers" originally published in 2012, published by the band via Pledge Music campaign, and how to mark the 30th anniversary of the band. All 1,000 copies was quickly sold, but they decided this signature to Fire records closer to your music and a broader range of listeners. In this connection, in addition to this re-release, this year plans to publish two box sets, which called "the Glass Era" and "The Creation Era". The first will be "And Bath Of Bacon ',' A Scandal in Bohemia," "Sex & Travel 'and' Distressed gentlefolk 'while others will include the albums' Fishcoteque ',' Big Planet Scary Planet ',' Condition Blue 'and' Cult Of The Basement '. We look forward to and how!

	<p />
</div>
  <p />
	  When 
		six of Northampton's top musicians gather to form a 'super' 
		group, what do you get? Why Wilson, a dub rock outfit of course!  
		<p />With 
		  comparisons ranging from the rocky side of Primal Scream, the bounce 
		  and beats of the Happy Mondays and elements of Alabama 3 and Stereo 
		  MCs, Wilson's sound is rich in depth and diversity.	<p />
		<p />For 
		  a project that originally started out as a solo 'thing' 
		  a few years back, the band has certainly developed into a great 
		  musical outfit.	<p />
		<p />Formed 
		  and led by Wilson Headstone, the renowned and successful musician, 
		  Pat Fish - of The Jazz Butcher fame - the band grew to encompass 
		  solo musicians and band members from across the town.	<p />
		<p />Members 
		  of Sumosonic and Tarantino funksters P-Hex amongst others were to 
		  join along the way and flesh out what was originally a three-piece 
		  band playing to backing tapes.	<p />
		<p />With 
		  all members having experienced gigging, writing and recording, the 
		  veteran musicians had no problems in producing captivating live 
		  shows and getting their sound produced on CD.	<p />
		<p />Gigs 
		  so far have included venues in Leeds and Cambridge alongside their 
		  most likely local haunt at The Racehorse in Northampton's Abington 
		  Square.	<p />
		<p />And 
		  it's not only the live shows which the band prove to have a 
		  control over. 	<p />
		<p />Recent 
		  workings in the studio saw Juilain Cope guitarist and producer, 
		  Donald Ross-Skinner at the controls for the production of tracks 
		  by the band at London's Notepad studio.	<p />
		<p />Wilson 
		  have built up quite a collection of material and recorded a selection. 
		  They are influenced by a variety of artists, ranging from Cypress 
		  Hill, New Order, Lee Perry and The Clash but are unsure whether 
		  this comes across in their sound.	<p />

	Since 1983 The Jazz Butcher has shown an undeniable skill in distilling the gist  out  of the most diverse styles, and a great songwriting productivity, as evidenced by the six LPs and ten singles they have released in the last four years. We are also getting used to being surprised by Butch, as he  jumps in different directions on each of his albums, although always with the same drive. The two twelve-inches released in 1986, "Hard" and "Conspiracy", were very different, and "Distressed Gentle-folk"  once again goes  on a different tangent. The common denominator is Butch's warm voice, which makes even the least inspired songs stand out. 
	<p />
	"Distressed Gentlefolk” is The Jazz Butcher's most laid-back album. Three impeccable ballads contribute to this: "The New World" (where Butch sounds like a crooner from the 1950s), "Angels," and above all, "Still In The Kitchen". A certain country air that pervades the entire album, as well as the jazz swing that permeates "Domestic Animal” or “Buffalo Shame”. Doo-wop and a nostalgic touch also make an appearance on "Who Loves You". But Jazz Butcher is not the only one who betrays clear influences: "Nothing Special", a simple pop song that totally belies its title, is one of the many examples of where the roots of the Woodentops can be found. (Or perhaps the other way around? Both singers have known each other for years...) The truth is that Butch is a great songwriter who doesn't appear to show any fatigue, but rather a capacity for reinvention  that makes his recycling task completely justified. Without surpassing the brilliant "Sex & Travel", "Distressed Gentlefolk" is also an outstanding album, in which Butch gives greater prominence to his sidekick Max Eider, who is in charge of the composition in "The New World" and "Who Loves You? In England there is a limited edition of the album, with a second 45 r.p.m. freebie LP  that includes the tracks of the maxis "Hard" and "Conspiracy", a new version of "Grooving In The Bus Lane" and a couple of unreleased tracks

Originally written as a thank you to the fans for supporting Mick Jagger and Keith Richards through a drugs and gaol escapade, JBC's version is even more likely to blank your thought processes than the original with its seering guitars, stamp on it drums, free form rap and, how should I put it, feeling of euphoria?

"THERE'S ONLY one smoking carriage on the trains from Northampton, and if they're
full they've got a lot of children on the seats," says The Jazz Butcher, with an
outraged shudder.

non-smoker they'd beat me up and charge me money. We're being discriminated
against! We're a civilised minority."

We most certainly are. Having been loudly insulted in the street for wearing a dress, then warned on the bus of an imminent Chinese invasion, I find the West End pub where we meet the most perfectly ambivalent setting: stuffed fish and fox staring gloomily at World War I enlistment posters ('It is far better to face the bullets than to be killed by a bomb at home').

through immediacy above all, is the only key that tradition's door will ever acknowledge.

On a par with Bonnie Tyler not knowing her single was out until It charted? "I didn't know it was out till it charted either, but then I wouldn't, would I? I don't mind if people laugh. because that's what they've got out of it, but 'some determination to be a nut-rocker'? I've got no determination to be anything that much. and I thought that remained fairly clear. it's my dislike of expectations, and the other night at The Rock Garden I just felt completely sickened. In fact I behaved rather badly and started mumbling about the 'same tawdry rituals'"

Just as wo hope that the June Brides. The Wedding Present. the Mary Chain, Mungo
and Midge have quite a part to play in injecting anti-bodies into the mainstream,
so too it should be recognised that The Jazz Butcher stands proud as a band
capable of juggling heartfelt emotional prongs to offset their more absurdist
displays. Real hip POP m'man!

DETERMINED ONLY to avoid being called a comedy band, the Butcher is in an itchy mood.

	WHEREIN 'Butch' (as he is known to his circle) reveals that he and his group are more than a one-non-hit wonder ('Southern Mark Smith'). Summery strums prevail on this good-humoured mini-sized collection of the Butcher's observations.

	'Sex And Travel' isn't 'Important', but it's happy, sharp and witty. Take 'Holiday', where <i>"regular English-speaking gentlemen/on holiday"</i> are recognised by their habits and foibles.

	The Butcher isn't taking any preaching stances, he's just reminding of the good things for and writing (of) the wrongs. 'Only A Rumor' does detray his fondness for John Cale, though, and there are several Caleisms in his pronunciation. But then... <i>"Olga Korbut drive me mad/I'll buy some vodka for her Dad/... everyone says keep in tough/I don't think they care that much."</i> A perceptive I'll essay on democratic detente.

Varios musicos han pasado por su establecimiento desde 1982 en que publica su primer disco, donde incluye una cancion dedicada a su idolo: el actor Peter Lorre. Los instrumentistas parece ser que se cansaban de sus devaneos filosoficos y optaban por emigrar as otras bandas como los Woodentops, Bauhaus y Love and Rockets. El carnicero por fin esta de suerte.

Se sirve de la herencia vocal de un Lou Reed campestre y jovial, at igual que en su dia to hiciera Lloyd Cole, aunque desde su vertiente mas obscura.
	<p />
	Cierta similitud de concepto hace del nuevo disco de The Jazz Butcher un equivalence, menos onirico, a las animas grabaciones de Robyn Hitchcock, otra de las figuras britanicas que en los altimos tiempos aportan ingenio at pop ingles. "The Fishcotheque" tiene los elementos necesarios de agresividad y dulzura para sobresalir por encima de los estereotipos actuates, donde lo anico que prevalece son las aparatosas , producciones.

	<p class="iview_intro">Formed in Oxford in 1982, The Jazz Butcher Quartet (or The Jazz Butcher, The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, The Jazz Butcher And His Sikkorskis From Hell) are of those best kept secrets for real fans & followers of underground movement. Alan McGee's Creation, David E. Barker's Glass Records & Vinyl Japan are three of the labels  that have "invested" on this immaculate band, whose founder Pat Fish remains a dedicated music poet totally irrespective to today's music biz. Their comeback album ‘Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers' finds the quartet in its best form ready to hit <a href="${jbc_gigs}/2017/Apr8_2000.html">The Continental stage on April 8th, along with The Jasmine Minks</a>...	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">So Pat, feel free to inform us about the latest news about The Jazz Butcher Quartet…	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">We’re just very happy to be up and playing again. It’s been a year since we lost Steve Garofalo and at times it felt as though the whole beautiful Quartet adventure was over. Everything had been going really well for us, and then it was all shattered by poor Steve’s demise. But we have re-grouped, enlisted a brilliant and conspicuously youthful drummer and we’re coming back out. We are looking forward to playing Preston so much, you would not believe it.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">What made you reform the band after a 12-year hiatus (2000-2012)? 	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Well, this thing never really quite stops. During that hiatus of which you speak Max and I played electric band gigs and duo appearances in America (4 trips), Japan (twice), Germany, Belgium and the UK. The trigger for the new album was Max phoning me up and reminding me that the band’s 30<sup>th</sup> birthday was impending. He wanted to go on a tour. I thought we couldn’t get any gigs unless we made a record. So we went and made a record. We funded it through PledgeMusic, whom I would recommend to any artist. They were great and our supporters were very generous. It was a very happy experience and it re-connected us with some good people. So I suppose it rather looked as though we had re-surfaced at that point, but, in fact, we’d been taking what chances were offered us all through the decade. When things really did start to look washed-up for me was at the start of 2014, when I was feeling my age and really couldn’t see a practical way forward. At which exact point, by happy accident, I ran into the gentlemen of the Quartet. One afternoon jam session and we had it, right there.	<p />

	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">On April 8<sup>th</sup> you are appearing live at the New Continental along with The Jasmine Minks. What should we expect? Any new tunes?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">We’re thoroughly looking forward to it. There will be tunes from ‘Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers’, there will be tunes as yet unrecorded and there will be some old tunes, some of them very old indeed. But you won’t have heard them played this way before.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">From Thatcherism to Brexit! What has Jazz Butcher to state about these? Is your art influenced by socio-political change/instability? 	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">In 1989 ${mercer} wrote in a review of one of our records “Good old Butch – bringing you tomorrow’s shit  -  today!” Bless him. The bizarre and incessant spite of the wealthy towards ordinary people has always been a constant irritant. Sometimes we treat the matter lightly, try to mock the mediocre clowns who run our country like a government of occupation. Other times, being reasonable people, we feel obliged to do a bit more screaming and shouting.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Your first two albums were released by the seminal indie label Glass Records. Is there anything special you’d like to share with our readers from this period? How was the relationship with owner David Barker?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Indeed, Dave released our first four LPs. He took us from a shambling mess in the back room of the Black Lion in Northampton all the way to sold-out shows at the Roxy in LA, via a roller coaster of mad European tours, on which he would often join us. He used to feed us cassettes, steering our impressionable young minds in the right direction. He paid for us to muck about in recording studios and brought us the lives that we have had. He is also extremely funny. D. Elvis Barker is a genuine unsung hero of British rock and roll.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Continuing specifically your 1984’s ‘A Scandal In Bohemia’ featured guest appearances from David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus. How was the collaboration like?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Kev didn’t play on ‘A Scandal In Bohemia’, though he did play on a couple of our records. We last played together at some gigs in LA in 2009. He is still very handsome. Vegan diet probably helps. It was Kevin whom I got to know first, just socially in Northampton. Dave was probably checking it all out from his secret Antarctic Headquarters. When we did meet, we both knew that we should do something. The original plan was that he should produce ‘A Scandal In Bohemia’. After a very strange three month period of bass-player rustling too complicated to relate here, he ended up joining the band as our bass player, in which capacity he ended up doing ‘...Scandal..’ and the follow-up ‘Sex & Travel’. After the making of that record he went off to start Love & Rockets, but we have remained good pals and collaborators to this day. I’m hoping to be playing some shows with him in France and perhaps London later this year.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">You have released 7 albums in the row through Alan McGee’s Creation label. What can you recall from this era? Would you collaborate again if there was a possibility?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Recall? From Creation? Have you not read the books? Seen the fillum? No, I jest, obviously. I love Alan McGee. And I remember everything. It was a great time. We assembled a great little band. If we weren’t in the recording studio or the rehearsal room, we were out playing gigs all over the world. Eventually we made a couple of good records, too. ‘Cult Of The Basement’ and ‘Condition Blue’ are two of my favourite Jazz Butcher records. I can’t see much future in Alan and me collaborating on anything serious right now. He’s looking after The Jesus And Mary Chain and Black Grape and plenty besides. That said, I really wouldn’t mind playing that little chapel he’s got down in Wales. We have talked about it. Maybe one day.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Your sound has been tagged under indie pop/jangle pop genre. Would you agree on this? 	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Not at all, no. I do not recognize “indie” as a musical term. To me it is simply a way of doing business. Sometimes, it is true, our guitars have been known to jangle, but I would prefer to think that they have more often been known to shimmer, glide and occasionally astound. But that is catalogue talk. The Quartet took the ‘Last Of the Gentleman Adventurers’ as its starting point and has moved on from there. What you will be hearing at The Continental is about as far away from “jangle pop” as it is possible to go while remaining on the same land mass.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Your latest offering was the excellent self-released ‘Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers’. Why did you choose to release this by yourselves? Artistic freedom?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">We hadn’t put out a record since 2000 and we had no idea about who or what was out there anymore. All we really knew was the dire stuff that one would read in the papers about the demise of the music business. Man, you could see it on the live circuit back then too, for that matter. I knew a couple of people who had made albums with Pledge and I noticed that they had both gone back and done it a second time. I spoke to them and was both well-advised and encouraged. Then I saw that Viv Albertine was doing a project on there. Well, if it’s good enough for Viv, right? The big lesson is that you don’t have to be Radiohead to make this work for you. Just a few loyal fans and a few good “incentives” to your supporters and you can do what you want to do. With some trepidation I hit the “go” button on our PledgeMusic project at teatime on a Friday. By bedtime we had 125% of what we had been asking for.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Being a man of vital music experience, how would you describe the current Oxford scene? Any interesting bands/acts we shouldn’t neglect?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">I don’t live in Oxford, so the only band I really know there is my friend Matt Sewell’s band. They’re called Charms Against The Evil Eye. Hell of a name chaps! In Northampton, where I live, ${mark_refoy}’s Slipstream are very, very fine. I just saw them last night. Mark and drummer Jonny were in Spiritualized, the other guitarist, Jason, also plays for Tame Impala, and Tim Harries is on bass and he’s played for everybody, including us. Four really experienced musicians playing very simple, beautiful psychedelic rock and roll. And a Johnny Thunders cover. You know, if I reckon they were called anything but Slipstream, they would be as famous as they deserve to be. The Moons are a good Northampton band, especially if you are a mod. They’re mates with Paul Weller and a couple of them play in his live band. The Lords Of Thyme have a lovely folk-rock thing going on. They have two EPs and an album out through Sunstone Records. Liam Dullaghan has moved out to Kettering, the mad bastard, but he remains quite the most wonderful singer-songwriter type to grace Northampton in a long, long time.	<p />

	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">What’s on the horizon for The Jazz Butcher Quartet?	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">Preston, London, London again. Fire Records are organizing a re-release of all the old Jazz Butcher albums. Soon come, as they say. We’re making demo recordings for a new record, too. We’re about 60% of the way towards something good. And it really does have to be good when you’re our age. Otherwise it’s just ridiculous. Most of all, though, we really want to get out and play. Anywhere. You’ll think I’ve been on the ayahuasca again, but the Quartet doesn’t even need a PA to rock you and we can prove it with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY-s5e9IVoo" target="_blank">footage</a> from a first floor flat in Bordeaux.	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">A question I didn’t ask and you would like to be asked. Feel free to send a message to your fans. 	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">So much easier to think of questions that I’m glad you didn’t ask. To the people who still follow us and support us I can only say a heartfelt “Thank you. Come and see the terrible things that we have done to your favourite songs.”	<p />
	<p class="iview_q">Thank you!	<p />
	<p class="iview_a">A pleasure, sir.	<p />

		<h3>CAUTION - This is a robotic translation of the original French publication</h3>
Mini LP, Glass records MGLAP001 , May 1985
	<p />
Why did you choose this mini LP to talk about Pat Fish and his first Jazz Butcher Conspiracy rather than Bath of Bacon (1983), Scandal in Bohemia (1984) or Distressed Gentlefolk (1986)? Perhaps because Sex And Travel embodies a kind of quintessence of the art of Butch, inimitable in its way of weaving elegant and delicate pearls on a wire stretched between the American urban rock (Velvet Underground - Jonathan Richman) and psychedelia To the Englishman of Kevin Ayers. He remained faithful to this line of conduct over a career that saw him record more than ten albums, first on Glass and then at Creation. His latest album, Rotten Soul (Vinyl Japan, 2000), on which he finally found his old accomplice Max Eider (author of the last title of Sex & Travel ), does not lose in this collection of albums of great hold.
	<p />
It was not uncommon in the 1980s to find the discs of the Jazz Butcher in the "gothic" or "cold wave"; This was most certainly due to the presence of David J, former bass player of Bauhaus, within the group at this time because nothing else, Can not explain this affiliation. This guitar-like music is indeed very clear and light: we enjoy the tribulations of "regular english-speaking gentleman on holiday" rhythmized by a typewriter ("Holyday") or considerations Of Pat on the Cold War ("President Reagan's Birthday Party"), we wiggle on "Red Pets", we contribute to the slavist choruses of "Walk With The Devil" where we imagine emptying a pint by listening to "Down The Drain ". However, A dull melancholy, which sometimes reminds one of Brian Wilson's, avoids the whole sinking into the mire or silliness. There are of course a few less playful songs ("Big Saturday" or "Only A Rumor", about emotional errors - Pat says he wrote "for the first time on his life as it was then") But it is behind the apparent gaiety of the whole that we must hear what is darkest and most profound. It will always be with Pat Fish: if the dominant image that emerges from his group is that of a band of joyful drills quick to ignite your living room or the local club (photos on the back of the album) It is also a discreet but eternal romantic (photos on the front: the same pose but the expressions are a bit more serious).
	<p />
The eight titles of Sex & Travel were recorded (in five days!) In Leamington in February 1985 and produced by John A. Rivers, as had been Scandal in Bohemia and as Distressed Gentlefolk . The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy was above all a story of elective affinities and if the band's line-up has moved a bit over the albums, the spirit has remained unchanged. And oh miracle, many people who once had access to this music have become members of this conspiracy. Few have departed ...

		<h3>CAUTIONE - This is a robotic translation of the original Italian publication</h3>
	Originally released in 2012 and to date the latest album by Jazz Butcher: "Last Of The Gentleman Adventures" confirms the bitter minority that Pat Fish in art Jazz Butcher has been casting for over thirty years to this part.
	<p />
	His formula was Jonathan Richman's and the European one: a bit of Velvet Underground, a little Postcard-sound and French chanson. Simple and easy songs, guitar sounds and rhythms of pleasure, all pleasing and fragrant motto like a freshly baked baguette on the banks of the Thames.
	<p />
	Now the materials are quieter and more reflexive when, thirty years ago, the man also gained a piece of English rankings and came to Italy to show small miracles.
	<p />
	The side-by-side stigma but the author and his band always lack the strength to make it effective with a more marked hook or some appropriate trick: Animals, All The Saints, Shakey. However, this man remains a bit of a heart.

	I've always been a fan of these Brits. Founded by Pat Fish With endless restructurings of members, The Jazz Butcher has always proved entertaining and challenging. ${adventurers} is a reissue of a limited 2012 album that was self-released for the 30-year anniver-sary, now paving the way for a new journey through this musical mindscape, with liner notes by ALAN MOORE and an appearance from SONIC Boom. It's simultaneously a flashback and a step forward, smooth and cool, and full of a sweet sense of humor - a little Britpop, a little jangle, some sadness, some feeling good, and a little French - but it's definitely Jazz Butcher, and I like it.

	Northampton based artist The Jazz Butcher, aka Pat Fish, is at his laid back best on this reissued collection of songs. The record was originally available in 2012 as a pledge item in a limited run of 1000. But now we have this reissue, which includes Pat Fish (guitar, organ and vocals), Max Eider (guitar and vocals), Tim Harries (bass), Jonny Mattock (drums and percussion), Rich Formby (guitar and harmonium), Owen Jones (accordion) and Sonic Boom (ghost chorus and drones on “Saints Prayer”). If you know Pat’s work, then you know that styles can be all over the place, but here they mostly center around quietly expressed sentiments with elements of jazz, folk, and low key rock and roll. It is a sleepy, nighttime album, with peaceful tracks like “Count Me Out” and opening track “Animals”. “Shame About You” amps up the energy a bit, bringing to mind uptempo Velvets or maybe even Jonathan Richman. The title track is somnolent, jazz-inflected pop, the perfect slow dance for a cold winter’s night. Part of me also imagines a musical line drawn between Pat and Robyn Hitchcock, as much for the vibe as the eccentric nature of it all. “Tombé Dans Les Pommes” is French cafe music, perfect for settling into after a long stroll along the Seine. “All The Saints” ups the energy a little, and is more typical of Pat’s work from the mid to late 80s. Lovely indeed! “Mercy” is heavily reminiscent of late period Velvets, and this is never a bad thing in my mind. “Black Raoul” has a bit of an R&B feel and mines the standard three chord blues riffs heard often in the 50s and 60s. “Shakey” is atmospheric and sentimental, and Pat dedicated the song to Brian Wilson. “Solar Core” kicks it up a bit, but is standard Butcher fare. “Saint’s Prayer” has ghostly voices and is openly psychedelic, even approaching dream pop territory. It is my favorite song here, not only because of the nods to the aforementioned genres, but also because it is stylistically different from the rest of the album. In summary, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers won’t rock you like a hurricane, but its unhurried way of enchanting you with its cool, mellow vibes might just suck you in. Recommended highly by this long time fan.

	<h3>Original German</h3>
	Berühmt waren die Achtzigerjahre auch als jene Zeit, in der man es als Musiker schon weit bringen konnte, wenn man nur über den richtigen Geschmack verfügte. Im Zitatpop zählte vor allem, welche Platten man gut fand. Die britische Gitarrenband The Jazz Butcher fand, anders als ihr Name nahelegt, damals vor allem den herzerwärmenden Pop der späten Velvet Underground gut oder des damals noch jungen Jonathan Richman. Bands, die sich am Feuer ihrer Heiden wärmten, gab es damals viele, and man fragt sich heute: Was ist nur aus ihnen allen geworden? The Jazz Butcher haben einfach immer weitergemacht. Zuletzt brachten sie 2012 ein Album in kleiner Auflage selbst heraus. Jetzt wurde „Last of the Gentleman Adventurers" vom Indie-Label Fire Records noch einmal neu aufgelegt. Und man muss sagen: So eine exquisite Suite sonnendurchfluteter Popstücke hat man lange nicht gehört. THOMAS BÄRNTHALER

	<div class="iview_intro">
	The Jazz Butcher, the public enemy n ° 1
	<p />
	Pat Fish aka The Jazz Butcher returns from the dead with a new album, Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers (Fire Records).
	<p />
	He talks to us about these new adventures, his long-distance musical journey and his special relationship with ... the police and the customs officers. Holy brothel, does the Butcher Jazz really disturb the world?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Good news on your new album, Max Eider is back with his incendiary guitars ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes, that's a special person for me. Officially, the Butcher Jazz stopped in 1995. But you also have this life after death. Less than a year later, however, we were invited to a festival in Mallorca. And so, all those years, we continued to play off radars, from Japan to the United States. But last summer he told me he wanted to stop shooting. It was too hard physically for him. It must be said that Pete has a very peaceful lifestyle. It continues of course to play on the discs but it does not turn anymore. He is replaced by a trumpeter.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Your new band is more acoustic ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes, at the beginning of the concerts, we are taken for a jazzy jazz band but, after a few songs, we find strange. And then we show the fangs and we are downright demented! This album was, in fact, initially done with two, with Max in 2012. We made an internet subscription to finance it. The 500 initial disks were sold in a flash. A new subscription was made for an additional 500 LPs. And then two unexpected things happened. I was planning concerts in a club in my town of Northampton. They wanted something jazzy. So I contacted my bassist (who was not then and who had been in class with me when we were kids). He said, "Is it to play with you?" I said, "No, no. But we did try. All three come from jazz. The bass player and the trumpet player played on cruises all over the world. And when we jammed, not even an hour, we knew we were a group. As the Clash were a group. It was amazing as a sensation. The second incidence was the arrival of Fire Records who contacted me to reissue my old records. I accepted but I also explained to them that they were coming at the right time since I had a new album to make known (beyond the first thousand subscribers). It was thus the ideal bridge between the past and the present. And they understood it very well.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Besides this new formula, there is also a more bluesy side in your music today ... Always condition blue!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's probably because I've listened to a lot of blues in recent years, old stuff like David Graham (Folk, Blues And Beyond). But this record was a bit like a Cup final in football, with two teams clashing. For us, this final would have been Alex Chilton versus Can.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	I love Chilton (from Box Tops to Big Star, and solo) but it's a sad example of an extremely talented, moving music that has never really been successful when it was accessible. I find it depressing about what it says of the public ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	For Chilton, I would suggest another explanation. It was not convenient for a record company. He was not one of those totally malleable artists that the majors love (even more today). He was not the type to be dictated what he had to do.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Yes, I understand, but by taking bankers or accountants, the majors will make music as a banker and an accountant ... Was that how it was when you started in the 80s?

	I was very lucky to meet labels like Glass Records or Creation. The two bosses of these record companies really believed in what is pompously called "artistic development". They allowed their groups time to mature and find their audience. Today, after two or three singles, we take stock and we decide whether to fire or not.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	And record sales have become so ridiculous (in quantity) that record companies are ruthless ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Of course ! In the 80s, the public was also much more present at concerts. I'm not talking about big bands like Radiohead who still have full stadiums. But bands like mine play in clubs or medium sized rooms. We stopped playing in those kind of places in the 80's. It's become a lot, much more complicated today, and these places have become scarce.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Same thing in France ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's the same all over the world!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	I was talking earlier about the more bluesy tone of your album but there is also this little jazzy color that has always flown over your discs, with tracks like "Just Like Betty Page" or "D.R.I.N.K. "...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's just a little perfume, you're right. I love jazz and even more soul. We love Wes Montgomery or Steve Cropper.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	The Velvet is also this little madeleine of Proust that is also found on the disc, with a song like "Shakey". Is Velvet still so important and present in your life?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It's a bit like a member of my family. He will accompany me until my death. But I can also spend a year without listening to them. But they never left me and never left me.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	What are the other members of the family?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	When I am asked for the music I like, I always answer: good music! But some of them hold a special place as the Velvet Underground, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Patti Smith that made me want to make music.
	It was a Tuesday night of 1976.
	I was watching TV with my parents.
	Patti Smith appeared on the screen to play live "Horses".
	I loved it so much that I made the trip to London to see her in concert the following evening (luckily she was playing one day after this TV show!).
	It was a great concert.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	This is original because, generally speaking, the English bands of your generation have been marked by the arrival of punk and especially the Sex Pistols ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I saw them one or two days after Patti Smith.
	They were not known yet, it was the name that made us laugh with a buddy.
	Besides, we were the only ones with long hair.
	With a couple that turned out to be ...
	Patti Smith and Lenny Kaye! But to get back to your question, punk was also very important to me.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	So you liked the Clash, the Damned, the Jam ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I cut you, the Jam were not punk.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	They are often associated with the wave punk 77.
	But they were more mods than punk, it is true.
	But the Buzzcocks were not exactly punk either.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I do not like the Jam.
	Even if some songs like "Going Underground".
	Paul Weller is a good songwriter but I do not appreciate his voice that it forces too much.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You had already sung in French with your famous "La Mer".
	You re-offend here with the mischievous "Fallen In The Apples" ...
	"The Sea" was inspired by that of Charles Trenet, no?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	My song "La Mer" finally has little to do with that of Trenet (Which I like very much else).
	It is, in fact, a song about how we are taught French at school in England.
	We had these little flexidiscs with these French songs / rhymes like "An Elephant Who Rocked".
	When I wrote "La Mer", I was drying an entire afternoon on a very serious, serious song, and I could not do anything.
	So I started to play something else, and the song came very quickly, including the lyrics in French (though I'm not so good at it in your language).
	The last two verses of "Falling in the Apples" ("You're okay? / In my armchair of clouds") are borrowed from "Boum" of Trenet.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You know French music well ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Oh, I also know Jean Sablon .
	(Laughs) But I like things like Jacques Dutronc or Françoise Hardy.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You're going to come back to play in France?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Ok, I prepare my garden and warn my friends!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	The reissues of your discs will include anything more than the original (good) albums?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I am quite dubious about all the shit which is sometimes added as a bonus on reissues.
	If these demos or other rarities had been so good, they would have been put on the record.
	But I think we'll find some shit for ours.
	(Laughs) We got it in the store!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Where did the name Jazz Butcher come from?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	When we started, we absolutely did not want to do this.
	We were in the early eighties.
	And you had a lot of bands with unlikely, ridiculous names: Factory Records Artists, Crispy Ambulances, Pink Military Stand Alone ...
	(laughs) I was with a friend and we inventions names equally Crazy to laugh and make fun of that.
	And he launched The Jazz Butchers.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	I know you opened a bookstore in Northampton.
	Which writers do you like?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	One of my favorites is the Irishman Flann O'Brien who wrote the stunning Third Policeman.
	I read a lot of music books and I like those of Greil Marcus (Lipstick Traces is fantastic).
	I love Saki too, a very caustic English writer on English society ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Some kind of P.G.  Wodehouse?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I'm glad you're talking about Wodehouse because he owes a lot to Saki.
	But the latter is much more caustic.
	For example, Wodehouse would write: "He ate an ice cream in the sun.
	Saki, he said, "He ate an ice cream that would soon complete his diabetes.
	(Laughs) Behind politeness and luster, the universe of Saki can be sinister.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	You're right, Wodehouse is the soft version of the English wit.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Saki is also happening in this very bourgeois milieu but it is very anarchist.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	Wodehouse has always a little even mechanical (even if I appreciate it) ...
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes, you are right, the details change but the screw comica is always the same.
	I also love Wodehouse.
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	About comica vis, in more than 30 years of Jazz Butcher, you had to live quite a lot of funny moments, no?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	I remember a tour where we left the USA to play in Canada.
	It was snowing hard.
	And the customs officers found in the van the baking soda used by our American merchandiser to wash her teeth.
	It must be said that she carried him stupidly in a plastic bag.
	And these idiots thought it was dope! In fact, rockers on tour ...
	(sigh) They got crazy, asked the chick (who told them the truth) and they even sent the powder to a laboratory for analysis.
	And I would always remember, one of the customs officers turned to us and said with his big voice: "Ok, which of you is the asshole who forced her to carry this shit?" A little later, I smoked a cigarette with one of them while waiting for some confabulation, and he said to me: "You know, it breaks my heart to see so adorable American girl mixed up with a traffic like that ...
	</div>

	<div class="iview_outro">
	But who is this jazzy butcher? Jazz Butcher is the group founded in 1982 in Oxford by Pat Fish.
	In the first line-up, we find the future keyboardist of Woodentops, Alice Thompson (who was also the girlfriend of Pat Fish).
	Just before the Butcher Jazz, Fish had also played in an ephemeral band with the singer of the Woodentops, Rolo.
	The indie pop of the Jazz Butcher, with lyrics tinged with black humor, earned him recognition all over the planet.
	In France, both Les Inrockuptibles and Nineteen plaited him laurels.
	Crown deserved, just listen to songs like "Party Time", "Mr Odd" or "Get It Wrong" to convince yourself ...

		<h3>CAUTION - This is a robotic translation of the original French publication</h3>
	It is a singer and sonwgwriter rare in France that we will be able to go and applaud on Saturday September 28 in Malakoff, south of Paris. Pat Fish, aka The Jazz Butcher, still performs regularly, alone or accompanied, in London and elsewhere in England, but has not performed often with us. Across the Channel as here, he obviously remains a cult artist. Who has done nothing to maintain the cult in question, but also nothing to make themselves known to a wider audience. Listening to his discography, most of which was reissued last year in two boxes at Fire records which also released his latest album, the delicious “Last of the Gentleman Adventurers”, we say to ourselves that his work is full of catchy popsongs, which would have deserved a better fate. The fact that the Jazz Butcher has only signed with independent labels (Glass then Creation), and the somewhat disconcerting versatility of most of his albums, where light pieces à la Jonathan Richman rub shoulders with raging rock titles with texts sometimes subtly political and heartbreaking ballads, will undoubtedly have limited his exposure.


	In March 2016, we met him in London, passing through (he lives in Northampton), happy to see “Last of the Gentleman Adventurers” reissued by Fire records after a first self-funded pressing of 1000 copies, quickly sold out. He came back for us on his beginnings under the alias The Jazz Butcher:
	<div class="iview_a">“It was the time when something like the third generation of post-punk was starting to turn into bad goth. Okay, I'm friends with ex-Bauhaus guys and I don't have a problem with goth rock, but I was getting a little tired of all these pale copies. So the music I was making then was in reaction to all that seriousness, but in retrospect I think it was less whimsical than it sounds. It was more like a mask.Take a track like “Girls Who Keep Goldfish” [on the first album “Bath of Bacon” in 1983, Editor's note]. At first glance it seems absurd and comical, but it expresses a strange form of hostility. At the time I wrote it, I must have been 24 years old, I had already been part of bands that had brought me neither money nor real pleasure, and I felt like I was about to give up. I think that well hidden, there was in these songs an anti-social feeling, the desire to be apart from the world. A bit like Syd Barrett… Like, “really, this guy is reduced to talking about fish in a bowl!”
	</div>

Note, on this same album without much equivalent in the English pop of the time, a pastiche of the minimalist electro-punk track “Warm Leathrette” by The Normal (interpreted a little later by Grace Jones), under the title… “ Gray Flanellette ”, a nod to“ Born to Be Wild ”(“ Born to be fried ”on“ Poisoned by Food ”), the moving“ Partytime ”which seems straight out of a Jens Lekman album, as well as an improbable song in French, “La Mer” (“But what there are elephants here!”), which the Little Rabbits will resume a few years later. Pat Fish had produced in the early 90s “Tramway”, the second album of another French group, Chelsea, and the current was not always perfectly passed between the musicians and him:
	<div class="iview_a">“They wanted a quartet of strings,I was trying to force feedback on the guitars to them! He remembered in the half-light of a London pub.
	</div>
In April 2017, we finally discovered him on stage in London , during a too brief opening act of other indie veterans, the Jasmine Minks. Two and a half years later, Pat the butcher should offer his fan club during this Parisian evening his best pieces - and there is no shortage of them. At the same poster, we will also find with great pleasure Tim Keegan, the singer of the group Departure Lounge, whose POPnews had distinguished the album “Too Late to Die Young” in his time (2002).

This will be the first of the meetings offered this season at the Barbusse neighborhood center (MQB) in Malakoff by Artsolis. Until June, at the rate of almost one per month, will alternate concerts labeled pop and folk (with the idea of bringing together musicians with similar aspirations to have them play together) and meetings devoted to chamber music, baroque, tango, traditional Scottish songs, etc. We will therefore have the opportunity to come back to it.

		<h3>CAUTION - This is a robotic translation of the original French publication</h3>
	It is the kind of evening that could hardly take place in France: two bands that made the Creation label's best hours in the 80s and 90s, who never sold a lot of records but left songs to posterity memorable. Although they are much less active than at the time, the Jazz Butcher and the Jasmine Minks have recorded a few tracks in recent years and are not only playing nostalgia for their fans.
	<p />
	On this Easter weekend, we have to be about 80 (including at least four French) to have traveled to the Lexington, a large pub on Pentonville Road, in a fairly deserted area of ​​London at nightfall. The room is upstairs. A glance at the programming of the month, aligning some beautiful names of the indie pop of yesterday and today, makes us say that we would probably spend our evenings often if we lived in the city.
	<p />
	We missed the first group, The Pacers, and come as the Jazz Butcher Quartet gets ready to start its set. This is not the acoustic swing version of which you can see some live videos on YouTube , usually shot in a bar or in the back room of a restaurant, but a rather rock formation. The classic trio guitar-bass-drums is complemented by a trumpet player playing with many effects, which give a slightly psyched coloring to the set.
	<p />
	Pat Fish (with whom we had drank a few glasses a year earlier in our previous visit to London, as shown in the pictures above), is in the middle of the stage, a mixture of coolness and tension underneath -jacente, able to leave in impressive guitar solos. The set of about forty minutes alternates from the last album, the excellent "Last of the Gentleman Adventurers", and classics like "Mr Odd" or "Shirley Maclaine". It is obviously too short (he will explain to us a little later that he could hardly overflow), but in only seven or eight pieces, this falsely diverting and versatile songwriter, although unpredictable, will have shown the full extent of his talent. Big class.
	<p />
	The formation of the group around the irremovable Pat Fish often changes, and he released that evening a new drummer. Not really an unknown since it was Dave Morgan, ex-The Loft and Weather Prophets. It was a funny coincidence that he was already behind the barrels the last time we had crossed the Channel for a concert, accompanying Vic Godard to Brighton in the spring of 2016 - and we had a little regret at not having approached him.
	<p />
	We take advantage of his cigarette break outside the bar to talk to him. Nice to meet French fans and show them that he knows a few words in their language, he tells us to remember that he played the Cigale (probably with the Weather Prophets), tells that he would be delighted to do new concerts With The Loft (the first group of Peter Astor had briefly met in 2015), and tells us about his studio in which he records with other musicians. A very nice meeting.
	<p />
	I had to discover the Jasmine Minks on the compilation "Creation Soup - Volume Three", found at the beginning of the 90s in a tray with balances of the Fnac. Besides the Pastels, Biff Bang Pow !, Primal Scream, Felt, Weather Prophets or Bodines, their "Cold Heart" held its rank. Their biggest success - everything is relative ... - that the Scots (of Aberdeen) will play that night, of course, like other singles of their debut - "Think!", "Where the Traffic Goes" "What's Happening" - energy concentrates that announced the C86 wave and its jingle-jangle guitars, as well as being part of a great line of English rock, from the Who to the Buzzcocks. "Ten Thousand Tears", a new 45-rpm more than worthy, will be heard, as the group has just released on its own label and whose benefits will go to the fight against Charcot disease (motor neurone disease).
	<p />
	The first part of the concert consisted of the entire second album, "Another Age", released in 1988 on Creation (of which Jasmine Minks was one of the first signatures). Nearly, it is obviously the same line-up that is on stage, and in spite of the weight of the years, neither the musicians nor their songs have been impaled. The Jasmine Minks were probably not the best band of her time, they missed what made the success of the Jesus and Mary Chain with whom they toured in 1984. But they had, besides catchy songs, principles and Things to say, and they believed in it. By 2017, they are still believing in them, as independent as they were thirty years ago, and their small audience (just younger than them overall). Difficult to remain insensitive.
	<p />
	Thanks to Alice at Fire records.

	<div class="annotation">
	I started the Wilson project fondly imagining that it would be
	a solo thing.
	<p />I figured that I could use my computer to make backing tracks
	for me to play along with, and thus get around the stunted expectations
	and inexorable tedium which normally attend the appearance of
	a man in his forties sitting on a stool with a guitar in his
	lap.
	<p />Largely taking the Great ${wolfi} my example, I thought
	that I might be able to present my songs in an interesting fashion,
	one which might afford me the opportunity to sit back and really
	play, rather than just holding down the basic tune with endless
	rhythm guitar strumming. I committed myself to doing a gig (in
	order to have a deadline) and set to cooking up some groovy backing
	tracks. 
	<p />A month or so later I had the bones of a set. I had built nice
	easy tunes, which would afford me a bit of space to stretch out
	and do something, and I had begun to figure out a few nice ideas
	for songs. 
	<p />Somewhere around this point, my pal ${russ}, who played percussion
	for ${sumosonic} and on ${rotten}, decided that he would help out at the gig. I agonized for a
	while before I decided that in that case we might as well get
	a bassist too. One night I was in a bar, looking for Aggi, who
	played the bass for Sumosonic. He seemed like a pretty obvious
	choice. I never did find Aggi, but I did run into Russ, who was
	with our friend Kathy Schaer a.k.a. Special K, one time Sumo
	vocalist. Rather to my astonishment it was announced to me that
	Kath was to be our bass player.
	<p />I had seen Kath hold her own on bass alongside Jonny Mattock
	and ${mark_refoy}, so I knew that she was good enough for the job.
	The three of us decided to style ourselves a "low power trio",
	and it was as such that we rehearsed and performed our first
	show at The Soundhaus in Northampton on <a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Mar1_2115.html">
	1st March 2001</a>. Along
	the way we tried to work up a sort of ascetic dub sound, with
	grungey loops, phat bass and sparse, loud guitar, largely tuned
	to a single chord for maximum drone simplicity. 
	<p />There were definite advantages in being in band where all the
	members lived within five minutes
	walk of each others
	front doors. Everyone had an income and two of the three of
	us had cars. Logistically it was already the best group I had
	ever been in. After the Soundhaus gig we played at
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Apr1_2200.html">The Racehorse</a>
	in Northampton and then went on the road to play
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Apr14_2130.html">in Leeds</a> for
	Team Borscht. Each time we played we enjoyed ourselves more and
	people were responding well.
	<p />As we entered May 2001 events came to pass which caused me to
	suspect that perhaps people were responding a little too well.
	My good friend Ian Botterill, the singer from Sumo and Fat Controller,
	came asking to join the band, bringing with him another guitarist,
	Steve Gordon, from the gargantuan Northampton funk collective
	P-Hex. Bearing in mind that I had just found out how much fun
	it can be to be the only guitarist in a band, I was a touch uncertain
	as to how all this would work out. Matters were further complicated
	within the week. Sitting in my back yard one day, ${curt}
	asked me: 
	"Can anyone be in your band? Can I be in your band?"
	"Of course you can be in my band, Curt,"
	I replied, 
	"Just as long as you play the Theremin!"
	<p />I figured that this was just the sort of reply the facetious
	old bastard was expecting.
	<p />It certainly was not what I was expecting when Curtis turned
	up a few days later with something that, while not technically
	a Theremin, was nonetheless quite clearly a Theremin! The 
	"Air-FX"
	is a device made for DJs. By moving one's hand over a series of invisible
	beams emanating from the Air-FX
	one can manipulate a whole rake of mad synthesised sounds, and
	even start to affect the final mix, dropping filters and all
	manner of other tricks. In our pal's music shop they are advertised thus: 
	"QUICK! BUY ONE OF THESE! THEY'RE MENTAL!"
	<p />I had to admit it. In the course of one week our band had doubled
	in size.
	<p />Our first date as a sextet came at the end of May. We found ourselves
	headlining a four band bill
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/May24_2100.html">at The Racehorse</a>. Immediately before
	us came Capdown (short for "Capitalist Downfall", fact fans!),
	a profoundly talented and effective ska/punk band
	with a new album and a slot at Reading Festival. It looked as
	though it would be a fairly pointless exercise trying to follow
	something like that, but we went ahead with it and it all went
	off very well. Capdown certainly seemed to enjoy it. So one after-show
	party later there we were, a fully functioning six-piece. And
	I had to admit that Steve's guitar really did bring something to the sound. As readers
	of this will probably know, I've been lucky enough to have worked with
	some really fine guitarists
	over the years, so I'm not being idle when I say that Steve is one of the most intuitive
	and sensitive players I have worked with. He is not flash or
	fancy, but he always seems to know exactly what will work in
	a situation.
	<p />Wilson was quiet over the Summer while I travelled with the JBC,
	but we picked up again in September. We played another
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Oct19.html">show in Leeds</a>,
	picking up a nice bit of press in the northern edition
	of The Big Issue. We did a
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Oct7.html">series of shows</a> at
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Dec2.html">The Racehorse</a> in
	Northampton, drawing larger audiences each time we played out.
	Given that almost everyone in the band has another band, it took
	quite a while for people to realise exactly what was going on.
	By the time that we played our
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/2001/Dec24.html">Christmas Eve show</a> it seemed that
	we had established ourselves an identity locally. 
	<p />The autumn also saw Ian, Curtis and me getting seriously into
	the business of writing and assembling our music in our own studio.
	Over a few months we developed a massive library of sounds and
	samples and worked it into some half a dozen new tunes. In January
	Ian moved his computer equipment into the studio, which now operates
	like a small factory, with three men working six hours a day
	most every day. I can honestly say that I have not worked in
	a more exciting and creative environment.
	<p /><a href="${jbc_gigs}/2002/Jan31.html">In January</a> Wilson played
	with ${gab}'s band, Tobermory, in Cambridge.
	<p />Up until this night I was very happy with the band's music, but I was concerned
	that maybe we were a bit disorganised
	and unimpressive vocally. This was the night that the singing
	and shouting caught up with the playing. Curtis, Ian and I travelled
	the 50-odd miles to the gig in a car together, screaming our
	heads off and singing like lunatics the whole way. There is no
	doubt in my mind that this had something to do with our performance

	<h2>THE STAR OF INDIA</h2>
	<div class="annotation">
	On the corner of Kettering road and Abington Avenue, just across from the
	Racecourse Pavilion, in one of the loveliest corners of the town, stands
	the Star Of India, one of Northampton's oldest and finest Indian restaurants.
	<p />
	I have been visiting this fine establishment ever since I arrived in Northampton
	in the summer of 1982 and it has inevitably played a major part in JBC history.
	There was a time when I was seriously thinking about to trying to run a
	club night there. In an Indian Restaurant! It was never going to happen,
	but the view out of the window on a summer evening as you pull on your beer
	and wait for your dinner is something to behold and it's time that you knew
	about the place.
	<p />
	The restaurant is the business of the family Islam, who are actually from
	Bangladesh. Despite their Muslim name, the Islam family are only too happy
	to serve you a foaming beaker of the good stuff, and when I first entered
	their restaurant I was delighted to see that they served the magnificent
	Dortmunder Kronen on draught. Decent German beer was as rare as rocking
	horse shit in Northampton back then, so I warmed to the place immediately.
	<p />
	The Star also benefits from some strange wrinkle in the infamous British
	licensing laws, whereby they are able to continue pouring the foaming beakers
	for you up until the hour of 1:00 am.
	<p />
	At this time the restaurant was small, perhaps eight tables, with a fairly
	traditional UK curry house flock wallpaper and mirrors arrangement. Later
	this was replaced by magnificent life-size paintings of tigers on the walls
	and little oriental verandah type roofs over each table. At one point in
	the nineties a patriotic fervour took hold and the walls were adorned with
	colourful murals of Sylhet back in Bangladesh. It was never claustrophobic
	like those joints in New York City with the stupid fairy lights and the
	rude shouty men. It was more like being in a nest - a tiger's nest - with beer.
	<p />
	Max, Owen and I dined at The Star on New Year's Day 1983 along with our
	pal KB Mensah. I can remember somebody having a copy of "Private Eye".
	On the cover was a photo of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who was
	going through all manner of indignities at the time. As they do, the guys
	at The Eye had dropped in little speech bubbles. A reporter was asking Arafat 
	"Why don't you throw in the towel?"  "I can't" he replied, 
	"I need it to wrap around my head."
	<p />
	Whatever, it was at that lunch that we all agreed to go piling off to see
	John Cale playing solo at the Venue in January 1983, a concert so massively
	inspirational that it fired us up for our entire musical "career".
	<p />
	As I came to frequent the Star regularly in the eighties (yes, that is where
	your money went), it came to my attention that the young guys who worked
	there would gather on quiet nights and play tapes of Indian pop on the restaurant
	stereo "a band!"  No, really, how good is that?  One of the young guys was
	a man of charming serenity and apparently endless patience called Bodrul
	Islam. His catch phrase?  "Yes, sir. Of course, sir."
	<p />
	Dining with Kathie one evening in the mid-nineties, I became very intrigued
	and excited about a bit of music that was playing in the restaurant. It
	had that sort of post-modern global thing going on, but with a definite
	subcontinental flavour. It crossed my mind that maybe this was the latest
	work of the band guys. Could it be possible? Even it turned out not to be
	them, I was still sufficiently interested as to want to know who had made
	this stuff. I flagged down Bodrul as he cruised elegantly through his domain
	and asked him what the music was.  "I believe it is Enigma, Mister Fish."
	<p />
	Today Bodrul runs the whole restaurant in his uniquely unflappable way and
	I never even think about talking music with him. For he knows I am giant fool.
	When the band was in Northampton we would dine regularly at the Star. It
	was while we were entertaining Alan McGee there after the video shoot for "${spook}"
	<p />
	In 1991 a traumatic thing came to pass. During the recording of 
	"${blue}" there was a Norwich-based misunderstanding involving ${lix}
	and my cash machine card, which resulted in my getting stuck at the
	studio with no money to get home on. I milled about the studio like a big
	dim ghost for a few days after the record was finished, and then Sue the
	studio maintenance lady gave me a lift back over to Northampton. 
	<p />
	On my return to NN1 I hit the bank, tooled up with wedge and headed for
	The Star. I was greeted on arrival by Bodrul, and I gazed out at the cherry
	blossom in the evening light with joy in my heart as I asked him for an
	enormous glass of his most excellent Dortmunder. In his dealings with The
	Punter Bodrul never errs on the side of flippancy, but on this occasion
	his demeanour was one of unusual solemnity. For the Dortmunder was gone.
	And so, dear readers, my fragile equilibrium shattered, in the Star Of India 
	I sat down and wept.
	<p />
	Still, The Star and I survived and I learned to make the transition to Indian
	Kingfisher beer in the end. But another shock was in store for me in 1994.
	As I left the lovely park-side apartment of my good friend Bob, I saw that
	the front of The Star had been entirely obscured by builder's crap. The
	windows were boarded up. I was mortified. What was to become of NN1 without
	this most essential of dining rooms? A few weeks later, a shadow of my former
	self by now, I read in the local paper that The Star was about to re-open
	after a major refit. In utter delight I called the familiar number and made
	a booking for the night of the Grand Re-opening.
	<p />
	The refit was a doozy. The restaurant was much bigger and decked out in
	pale blues and white, with lots of plants and engraved glass panels, classy
	as hell. And there were elephants. Great white elephants standing two feet
	tall guarded the tables, as solemn and auspicious as Bodrul himself, elephants
	with tusks of gold. There was a new menu, champagne on the house and a visit
	from the Mayor. What a night!
	<p />
	Since then The Star has truly thrived as one of Northampton's finest Indian
	restaurants, and I have tried to do my bit to keep it so.
	<p />
	It is so popular these days that it can be hard for the waiters to keep
	up with things, and on one deeply embarrassing occasion I had to take Bodrul
	aside and remind him that I had Americans getting hungry here. But one screw-up
	in 20 years isn't bad going really.
	<p />
	Recently in Northampton's newest and most ostentatiously up-market Indian
	restaurant (recommended by The Great Depak Patel, who usually knows all)
	I was reduced to rioting within the hour after the waiters completely forgot
	to bring us any food at all.
	<p />
	The other day I saw in our local paper that an expatriate Northamptonian
	in Peru had asked his parents to bring him a curry from The Star when they
	came for a visit.
	<p />
	This, dear readers, is what The Star is about. I am going there now.

	<p />THOSE conversant with the sprightly guitar-based pop-rock produced around the British Commonwealth over the last decade -- whether by the Jazz Butcher or such stylistic familiars as the Smiths, Robyn Hitchcock or the Church -- will not be surprised by the Butcher's latest, "Condition Blue." They should, however, be pleased. "Blue" is not especially distinctive, but it has charm to burn.	<p />

	<p />Although decorated with strings, saxes and female backing vocals, songs such as "Girls Say Yes" and "Our Friends the Filth" (the most Church-like track) are defined by their ringing rhythm guitars, which alternately saunter or rave (as they do, most notably, to end "Racheland"). Unsurprisingly, a frequent topic of the songs written by the Butcher (whose actual name is Pat Fish) is romance (and romantic obsession). Whether observing the objects of his affection at close hand ("She's a Yo-Yo") or at a remove ("I've had a thing about Shirley MacLaine since I was so high" he sings in a tune named for the actress), the Butcher employs a vulnerable-adolescent persona characteristic of the genre. That can be a little precious, but the Butcher and company more than compensate by getting their guitars to jingle-jangle just so.	<p />

		May 3rd, 2000 Backstage at the Echo Lounge in Atlanta, Georgia. (and Max Eider was present off and on)
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">Lisa King: We'll just roll it.</div>

	<div class="iview_a">Pat Fish: I'm a bit of a digresser, so that's probably just as well. I'm an old boy you know.</div>

	<div class="iview_q">LK: So how did this whole thing start?</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	PAT: Coming to America and everything? The whole group started so long ago that I bet only two and a half people can remember. It all began ..  him and me (points to Max Eider) used to play in a band many years ago in the city of Oxford, and it was one of those classic cases, of being on welfare and trying to buy your own P.A. and your own van, and trying to play in other cities, not realizing that there was no point in going to play in another city if nobody knew who the hell you were, and by November of '81 we got really tired of it. And I for one jacked in playing music at the age of 23, in1981. But I moved to the country, and I got really bored and I had nothing to do, so I taught myself how to play guitar. I used to play saxophone, and I taught myself to play guitar a little bit, and started making these little tapes at home. And one of the first things I wrote was a tune called "<em>Zombie Love</em>." Which is exactly that. It's about having sex with the dead. And I wanted to send this tune off to my mates, but I didn't want to put 'Pat Fish' on the cassette, 'cause I didn't really feel that this was exactly me, you know what I'm sayin'? So a friend of mine had come up with this phrase, '<em>Jazz Butcher</em>' for a laugh. We were just making up stupid names for groups one night. And my friend 'The Anti Christ' he came up with '<em>The Jazz Butcher</em>.' He also came up with direct mailing, so he really is The Anti Christ. Big advertising bloke now. Still speaks to me occasionally. Anti had come up with this thing, '<em>Jazz Butcher</em>' and I thought "Yeah that's about right. <em>Zombie Love</em>. I'll put that on the side of the cassette like." I sent to two friends, and to two guys at record labels, basically because I thought it would give them a laugh. But one of them came back, the great Dave Barker, at Glass Records in London. He comes back and goes, "Hmmm. Want to make an album." And I'm like, "Want to make an album? Does the pope shit in the woods? You know?" so, .. yeah allright. Whatever. And so Max and I went touring down to South London, and made this record for about thirty five dollars. And Barker says, "Well, you've got to call it <em>Jazz Butcher</em> now." And so we called it <em>Jazz</em> <em>Butcher</em> and it stuck ever since. And when we made that first record, I had a little day job, and I thought well some people spend a fortnight in Spain or whatever, I'll spend a fortnight in a recording studio, and that's what a terrific holiday. Maybe if we sell a few hundred they'll let me do it again. And they did. We sold a few hundred, and they did let me do it again. But the second one went mental. 
	<p />
	You know me and my girlfriend sit around at night listening to music and she goes, "It's the songwriting that counts," and I go "fuck all that, its' the sound that counts." And I'll go "Sound!" and she'll go "Songwriting!" and I'll go, "Sound!" I just met a guy back in Northhampton and he's 22, and he's totally into <em>Can</em>. And his band sounds totally like their into <em>Can</em>. It's wicked isn't it? I mean <em>Can. </em>
	<p />
	They're like sixty year old German hippies, and still no one has topped it, you know? Still the young people give respect. I always wanted to do "<em>The Hula Dance</em>." There was an incredible remix of that by a couple of kids from like Bonn or Cologne or somewhere. And it was almost like kind of techno bottom end. That marvelous thing where they take the vocals and put them into a sampler, syllable by syllable. I've been wanting to do that tune ever since. 
	<p />
	We were doing a tour in '85, I can remember this to the day, it was the tenth of December. <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/Dec10.html">And we were in Naples, in Italy</a>. And there is a photograph of Max and I; and there are walking deadmen. And they are in a better state than me. The band's only been going about two years, but a bottle of vodka every night, wheee he he he .. Owen comes up to me in Naples, on the balcony of this hotel, and he goes, "Hey." and I go "What." He goes, "You should join the SMDP." I go, "The SMDP?" and he goes, yeah, "The smoke more dope party." I ended that tour with a bloomin ulcer in my tummy. I was only about 26. 
	<p />
	It's not like we're famous. There's no reason at all, I mean like, if you said to someone in my home town, that we go out and play to a crowd in whatever town in the U.S.A., unless they're one of my mates and they got used to the idea, they just laugh at you. And the great thing about my hometown, is that I never, ever get bugged or recognized. I never get any of that until one night. About '92. I went to see <em>Chapterhouse</em> in the venue just down the street. I went into the gentlemen's lavatory, I was just splashing away on it, and this kid comes up to me, (in drunken sailors voice) "Ayy ..  Jazz Butcher .. ayyy .. " 
	<p />
	And I'm like, "Don't you know what town this is? Leave me alone." But now I've got these twenty something's coming around my house, hanging out. And I really don't know what they want .. well, they want my <em>Can</em> LP's that's what they want. It's good, but in another way it's bad because really the twenty something's would be looking at people like Max and I and going, "Faack off you old fools!" you know? And you see bands today and they're in their twenties, and they are looking to <em>Can.</em>
	<p />
	"<em>The Skinheads</em>." We've been playing that so long now. Somebody told me they went to see <em>Cracker</em>. And they shouted out " The Skinheads!" And Dave Lowry goes, "Oh, you gotta' go see <em>The Jazz Butcher</em>." It's a shame that we couldn't bring our mate Curtis with us. Because he's got a big shiny bald head. And the little rap I do in the middle, I do it for him because normally he comes running on and does it himself: "I'm no so big. I'm rather small. I've got a head like a big bowling ball." He's from Edinburough. The black man from Edinburough. There had to be one. But he rules, Curtis. There's something for you to seek out. He's got a wicked little album out. Called '<em>The Bean King</em>.' Curtis E. Johnson. 
	<p />
	He was mad because for years he worked under pseudonyms. And then he said, "Stuff it. I'm going to come out and just be myself." So he makes his records as Curtis E. Johnson. And within months of its' release, Madonna starts recording a song by a bloke called Curtis Johnson. So I think it's just as well he put that "E" in there. But it also makes me laugh because it makes me think of "White Courtesy Telephone." "White Curtis E. Johnson? I don't think so." But he's really pail skinned, and he did a gig once in Northhampton. He's playing the blues he's doing "Hoochie Coochie Man," you can ask him about this, and he's singing this, and there's these two thirty something white kids, in the back, having a pint and watching him, and the guy is rather showing off to his girlfriend. And at the end of one tune he goes, " Mmmm. He plays the blues allright. For a white bloke." I had to tell him later. He's into making web sites for other people. His brother has a company that does like internet solutions, and so forth. His brother drives two Porches.
	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_q">LK: So I guess that's big everywhere.	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_a">PAT:Well, it's getting that way isn't it? You meet a twenty something that says, "I'm a web site designer." And you think, "Yeah you're unemployable." The mad thing is it's the bosses, isn't it? The bosses, they're so set in their ways. "Oh we've got to get some of these computers, and oh yes twenty grand, that's fine .. etc." You know Curtis'll do it for you for thirty quid and a pint of beer! You just get that thing that the guys at the very top haven't got a clue what's going on. And they're the guys buying new software every year. They are the ones making it impossible for one computer to talk to another one you know. I suppose they keep the software companies afloat. But I'm a big fan of Radium myself. Those naughty Germans. Naughty, naughty, naughty Germans. You didn't hear this from me. Don't put this on the web site. Steinberg will find out and I will be killed. But honestly in our town the idea of paying for software is like, excuse me? Don't you have any friends? You guys are like five years ahead of us anyway. (Americans.) Here you are doing your streaming, and in Britain you're lucky if you can get a photograph up there. "I do not mean to publish any of these pictures if they're not copywrite, please contact me." 	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_q">(Innocent bystander walks in room and says:) It's like that song, too much information by the Police.	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_a">PAT: By the <em>Police</em>? I like the <em>Backstreet Boys</em> a lot more than <em>Sting</em>. I do man. They've got that do-wop thing going and some proper R & B going on in the bottom end. I know it's tailored for mass consumption, and shit, but they are actually making decent music. Not that good, I mean it ain't going to blow your mind, but when you're comparing them to <em>Boy Zone</em> or <em>West Life</em> or something .. So I don't know what to tell you. Keep on with all that factious <em>Jazz Butcher</em> history? We've only got 'bout another 23 years to go ..  But it kicked off, and we didn't expect shit. But the second album we made got noticed. Possibly because David J was on it, and he had just come out of <em>Bauhaus</em>. It kind of went off and we got into Europe, and the English kind of abandoned us really quick; by 1985 we were all over Europe but we were still playing pubs in Britain. In about May '86, we were playing in a pub in south London, we were getting about 250 quid, about 400 bucks .. not even that, maybe 350 bucks playing in a pub, and that Barker character from Glass Records, he goes, "Would you like to play in the U.S.A.?" We were just like, "Oh leave it." And we bloody did. We bloody did. And we were so ill prepared. Cause we got over here, not knowing what was going on. And it turned out that CMJ and Geffen put out this compilation album of one of our first three records, and it was number 2! Nobody told us! And I just opened the paper one day, and was like "Oh look, The Ramones are on the top of the .. .FUCK!" So we were totally unready for that. And by the end of '86 we were split up. Max was gone. We'd been out about two years, getting lucky in complete chances. Just complete frauds. We'd been out a few years and it was just time to get lives again. I dunno .. I just kept doing it because I didn't think I was good for anything else. I made some more records, and then right about the middle of the '90's Max was hanging around. He'd sometimes open for us. And then we split up at the end of '95, and in '96 some guys in Spain who didn't know us invited us to do a gig. Because they didn't know we had split up. So I called him up, and out we went. Well, we've been around the houses. I'm just trying to get up to date. Between '95 and last year we've popped out and done the odd gigs. We've done weddings .. <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1997/Sep19.html">a wedding on a boat in Seattle</a>. I've got this one song. It goes like this: " This room is swaying like a boat .. " and I thought I can't miss this ..  "because it IS a boat." We had a laugh at that. We just started doing things if it fell into our laps and involved a pleasant trip or something groovy then we'd go and do it. And then last year, come September, we did about five dates up and down the west coast. And they went really, really well. Although we knew it wasn't going to be as strong for us on the East side, but we thought there's no record company behind it, there's no machine behind it, but on the other end we don't want anything out of it except a really good time. We've just been playing around. We played to 11 people in Iowa City. Do you know where that is? Because I'm fucked if I do. The keenest one, the keenest person in Iowa City had driven for something like 300 miles from Kansas City. And he'd been tripping the whole way.	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_q">LK: Where did you record the new record?	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_a">PAT: The one we just made? We recorded it in the back bedroom of our ex-guitar player's house. 'Cause we had this guitar player from about '90-'92 time, called Pete Crouch, who ended up leaving the band to become an air hostess. Quite literally, you run the risk, if you fly to London on British Airways, you might just get Crouchy going, "Coffee sir?" Having freaked out, and run away from the group to be an air hostess, he would show up to the gigs and get massively drunk, and go "Take me with you! Take me with you!" So we've stayed good mates, and he's built himself a little home studio. So we made the record. 
	<p />
	
	"Walking With Jesus." I sang that once. And I was excited about it all day; I was walking around Northampton, and I was walking around town all day thinking, "Yes, yes. I will sing it tonite like Otis Redding." Yes. Made a rock fool of myself. Do you know Richard who started <em>Spectrum</em> with <em>Sonic Boom</em>? He's got a record out called '<em>Tribe Of Two</em> <em>Thousand</em>.' Have you heard that? Well, the band is called '<em>Tribe Of Two Thousand</em>' and the record is called '<em>Phased and Confused</em>.' And it's wicked. He's got this really got this very good-looking, charismatic, and also thoroughly mad singer. The guy's been like forcibly locked up a few times in his career, which is getting a bit manic.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">LK: So have you done any other things?	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">PAT: What, other things outside of <em>Jazz Butcher</em>? Yeah, a few things. Produced a few bands. No one really successful. Done a lot of recording with <em>Spaceman</em>, <em>The Blue</em> <em>Aeroplanes</em> .. We toured with the <em>Aeroplanes</em> over here in 1990; they were coming and we were coming. We had done a little tour together around the U.S. in 1990; It was the band that made the album '<em>Swagger</em>'. They really had firepower. Paul who ended up playing drums in the band, he was playing drums with us on that tour. They kind of toppled over, they thought we're not and indie band anymore, and we're gonna be proud of it. They recorded with Larry who produced <em>Los Lobos</em>, engineered <em>Bob</em> <em>Dylan</em>, and what a lovely bloke he was. I thought they were incredible. I saw the <em>Aeroplanes</em> on tour about March 2000, and I was like no, get off. Impossible. But then again, most people that would see <em>Jazz Butcher</em> on tour would think that can't be possible. It's amazing what goes on. I don't want you to think that we're doing like the <em>Eurythmics</em> or something. We just don't feel like that you know. For us it's just this wicked holiday. You wouldn't believe how well we've been eating. If there is a feature of this tour in the United States, it's not thick crowds or devotional goodwill; although there have been elements of all those things. You know the average European will spend four or five weeks in the U.S. and it's like "Ha ha! Burgers! French Fries!" But no .. well, it's like the beer thing when we first came in '86, you were just lucky there was Becks and Heinekin. But like now, the beer thing has kind of like come around. In a few years there's going to be room for Socialism! Well you know sometimes when we're out on the road, and we're getting a breakfast like, we'll go to Bob Evans or something, you can see like 25 waiters and waitresses, and it still takes 20 minutes for your eggs to come. And you're like, "Wow, you have your beaurocracy; all you need are some tanks!"
	<p />
	I think it's good, I dunno, I think it was the eighties, but things got really homogenized here. And now you're into the local thing. Every town's got their local brewery, and their local attitude, and their local paper. I've always liked the place, but now I think it's a little bit more on the go. I'm not a huge fan of Bill Clinton, but I'm not bothered with what he does with his 'willy' like. But he didn't do that much for me. I was happy when he beat Bush. But it just seems that when you get a guy like him hanging around, and also because there were like wars to take your attention away; But it seems like there's just a little more looseness at home. You know it's the redneck with the baseball bat that's got the license to .. well .. with that having been said, JBC and rednecks .. we get right on. Only a couple of nights ago, down in a shed in Birmingham, Alabama, by their own admission, they're own slogan, is "The Neck. Birmingham's Dirty Little Secret." And we got down there, and there was perhaps forty or fifty people into it, and the rest were just disinterested rednecks, and by the end of the night they were all there. The soundman said we were the best band he had seen in five years. While they were making you a cheeseburger, they were making me a cheeseburger. No .. we sound like we're being really horrid to Birmingham, but the people that showed up they were tops, even though they didn't care about the group. They were just top people. I have friends from Montgomery. This isn't like worth putting on the internet is it? "I have mates in Montgomery."
	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_q">LK: We'll just take your words, and sample each word. And copy and paste them and make our own story. And then sync it to "The Wizard of Oz."	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_a">PAT: Oh, what is that thing that went around about five years ago, about Pink Floyd and The Wizard of Oz? What was that about?	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_q">LK: Yeah, you start it at the third lion roar, and they supposedly, "Dark Side of The Moon" synched up as a soundtrack.	</div>
	
	<div class="iview_a">PAT: This has got to have originated somewhere with long winter evenings. No, you've got to be really bored to come up with that. You've got the '<em>Wizard of Oz</em>' on video, and someone grabs '<em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>,' and it's like, you can't even think of something better to put on than '<em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>.' Bloody Christ, how many people have come out and tried it? Somebody was on some tabs on that one. Yeah, cause things do seem that much more important. Or so I've heard .. One big thing for me was when Eno started making his records when he'd just come out of <em>Roxy Music.</em>
	<p />
	It's almost like the missing link for me between late sixties and the punk thing. And I love them. But you never hear it anywhere. I've tried to put it in my music, but somehow it always gets smoothed out even though I know it's there. But if my words ever sound mad, it's because like I've always thought the words on those records were great. Because they did mean something. It wasn't really like he was writing in code, you just had to take it totally literally, and then it was like, "Fuck, you know, Brian .. " 	</div>

	"The Jazz Butcher is not a band. It's me. Let's get that straight. It's like, I'm the Jazz Butcher, this is my band. It's always been like that."
	<p />
	There's always been a certain amount of confusion surrounding The Jazz Butcher, and between us we're trying to clear it up. Me and this enigmatic singer, this man who chooses to spend his spare time living in Northampton with his cat. Why 'Jazz Butcher', anyway?
	<p />
	"It's part of a caption from a painting, I was walking about with this other bloke who was looking for a name as well, and we came across it simultaneously. I said to him 'I'll take it if you don't want it'. He didn't. So I called myself 'The Jazz Butcher'."
	<p />
	The Butcher's been playing gigs, writing songs, changing line-ups for years now, ever since he was a student In the Oxford of the late 70's, the Oxford of bands like the Wow Federation and the Dennis Bovell-produced Jazz Insects. The only constant factor has been guitarist Max, almost like a quiet other-half, Smith to the Butcher's Jones. This is a come-on-in-and-browse-for-a-bit band and David J., ex-Bauhaus, is browsing now too. The albums ('The Jazz Butcher In Bath Of Bacon' (1982) and 'A Scandal In Bohemnia' (1984), both on Glass records), they're unstable, heterogeneous, a confrontation of different approaches. They give you a sense that everything was just slightly haphazard in the studio, that there was no strict division between getting it right and getting it wrong. Very random, very suck-it-and-see, The Jazz Butcher.
	<p />
	He enlarges: "Sometimes, making a mistake is an important part of writing a song. It just turns out differently from how you expected, that's all. Maybe it works on a different level. Maybe the mistake helps you to see it differently. It's a case of keeping your options open."
	<p />
	'A Scandal In Bohemia' is an album full of surprises, a lucky-dip of a record, a collection of chirpings and carpings, parodies and primal screams. It's got everything from the brittle, pure whimsy of 'Just Like Betty Page' to the beastly, marmalade-in-the-grooves sound of 'Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present'. "I get In a fu-er-y when I'm not in a brewery'. 'Southern Mark Smith', I tell the Butcher, is the prime cut, a spangled, lumpy song, although it might as well be 'Sullen Mark Smith', or even 'Son Of Mark Smith'.
	<p />
	"Right. Do what you want with it. 'Son Of Mark Smith'. Could be, yes. It could make just as much sense that way. A German guy, you know what I mean, the archetypal detail-obsessive, efficient, comic German bloke, interviewed us the other week, asked us what was this great 'scandal', and what did we mean by 'Bohemia'? I told him it was the title of a Sherlock Holmes book, which it is. What does it mean? I dunno what it means. Its up to you."
	<p />
	And what does he find funny?
	<p />
	"People falling over In the street!"

<b>THE PERSONNEL.</b>
<br/>
${pat}: The Jazz Butcher: vocals, guitar, mid-20s. solicitor's clerk.
<br/>
${max}: guitar, vocals. literature buff.
<br/>
${owen}: drums. hair as long as Oxford Street.
<br/>
${dj}: bass, formerly a member of Bauhaus
	<p />
<b>THE PAST.</b>
<br/>
The name The Jazz Butcher has existed for a number of years, but the line-up has been unsettled. When they received a scathing review of their <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Feb3.html">Rock Garden performance</a> in this journal, they had been brazening it out with no bass player rather than cancel and upset the tourists. The above line-up is now permanent.
	<p />
<b>OUTPUT.</b>
<br/>
It was the tale of their debut single which first attracted my attention. but '${smiff}' also had sufficient musical chutzpah to succeed. They saw Mark Smith last week. Pat Fish, creator of The Jazz Butcher and most material, likes The Fall.
	<p />
Pat Fish can impersonate a cassette recorder and while he was buying a drink I was told that he once walked through Northampton with no trousers carrying a bass drum. The album released last year is ${bacon}, mostly written by Mr Fish in bursts when he was bored. It featured instant classics such as '${foot}' and '${party}'. Sometimes they are reminiscent of the late lamented Modern Lovers. so I asked Pat Fish about this...
	<p />
	<div class="iview_a">
Yes, I think there are lots of dippy college boys all over the world listening to old Velvet Underground records at this very moment. Rather than imitating Jonathan Richman directly, we simply were influenced by The Velvets.
</div>
	<p />
Fish has covered Richman's 'Affection'.
	<p />
Current single is 'Mamie', which I am told has nothing to do with the Hitchcock film. backed by the epic '${wheel}', a true tale now wearing out my stylus.
	<p />
<b>THE PRESENT.</b>
<br/>
Playing live a lot as they have not played much, except as duo (Pat 'n' Max). They also drink more than their fair share of beer and occasionally play silly buggers, although tonight they are subdued, neglecting to employ the flashing neon backdrop. Pat Fish has never thought that he was the son of God. 
	<p />
Pat Fish loves all creatures (NOT A HIPPIE THOUGH), most of all cats and fish, more specifically, kittens and goldfish. His favourite record at the moment is the sadly unknown Moscow Drug Club' by B.B Gabor. and he informs me that the best music is "a wee bit dumb". He also has an undying affection for the French songster, Charles Renais, and has two cats called Stirling and HRH Lady Wilbur.
	<p />
At the moment the group do live covers of 'Roadrunner' and the most understated reading of 'Sweet Jane' since Moot The Hoople.
	<p />
<b>THE VERDICT.</b>
<br/>
The Jazz Butcher retain the spirit of Punk Rock inside, I am reliably informed, although you will never see them wearing studded leather jackets.
	<p />
So, while most independent records are about as joyful as having a nail banged slowly through the back of your hand. the product of The Jazz Butcher although never of the giddy heights of artistic excellence reached by the likes of classic Fall, is more than enough to be going on with.
	<p />
Who knows? 1984 may yet see the release of 'Northern Jazz Butcher'.

	Interview with Julian
	"Jazz" Pransky-Poole, formerly of Strangelove, and currently
	guitarist/keyboardist with Witness.
	<p />
	Interviewer: Dylan Harris, February 2000
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">"Xylophone tinkler sporting a wild hairdo not seen since
	Eraserhead" is how the Melody Maker once described you. Fair
	description?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I suppose its as accurate as me saying "Melody Maker..try's to act cool and
	independent, but its secretly financed by Homes and Gardens magazine"
	<p />
	But yeah I guess it is a fair description !!..I tinkle on the X and I guess my
	hair is kind of out of control...That's what happens when you watch too much
	Seinfeld..it's that Cosmo Kramer !!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">So when and how did joining Witness come about? Was it simply a matter of
	John Langley (also ex Strangelove) recommending you to the rest of the band?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	It was a weird night I got the call as I had just got Quarantine and was listening
	to it all week thinking this is awesome... Then I hadn't spoke to John in ages
	and I was honestly seconds away from lifting up the phone to say hi and to tell
	him that I thought Witness were fantastic - BUT the phone rang and it was John
	saying "you know I said that if we need a pedal steel
	player".."well we don't!!, but we need a extra guitar/keyboard
	player"...
	<p />
	I was, to coin the phrase - Over the Moon !!
	<p />
	I had been listening to the Red House Painters last album 'Songs from a Blue Guitar'
	and Witness over and over and had been thinking how lucky John was to be working
	with such an incredible singer as Gerard...then I got the
	offer to..
	<p />
	I don't actually know what John had said about me to the rest of the
	band/management...I imagine it was words along the lines of "he's a tinkler
	sporting a wild hairdo not seen since Eraserhead" !!!!!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Was the initial plan for you to just help out on a live basis?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah I think it was - I don't think they had thought about the long term aspect
	to an extra member at that point...All they knew is that they were having
	difficulty in recreating the songs live... I never did see them live as a four
	piece - but after having to play every instrument except the fluglehorn (there
	is still a chance !!) in their songs, it dawned on me that "how the hell
	were you doing this before "...."Very badly" was the usual
	reply..
	<p />
	Initially I also played on the recorded versions of Heirloom and My Own Old
	Song...
	I hadn't played the piano hardly before that - I met them at the studio whilst
	they were doing the album - and a few hours later they asked me to put down some
	piano on this track they been working on which was Heirloom.
	<p />
	I'm sat there with headphones on and Gerard's doing a vocal take at the same
	time..so I've got this huge piano in front of me and I'm thinking "F#%K!.."should have learned piano..where's C again"..all the while I've got this
	'send shivers down your spine' voice booming in my headphones, it was
	bizarre...I'd only just met them and didn't even know their names !!!..
	<p />
	Furthermore I couldn't understand a word they spoke !!..they said it was in F or
	C or was that G ??..they sounded so northern I was lost..that's why stop on the
	F in the chorus piano line - I'm thinking "what did he say ??"
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">I notice that you're credited with the co-writing of new track, "Zero
	Zero". Do we take from this that you are now a "full time" member
	of the band?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I wasn't part of the publishing deal - as I obviously didn't know them at the
	time..that is why it is credited that way.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">How much input have you had into the writing of the new album?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I purposely have not been involved in the songs for scratch. The last thing they
	need is someone upsetting the balance of song writing within the band.
	<p />
	Yeah I could have gone to town with writing for Witness and I've got enough
	stuff to make an album that rivals the Pumpkins Siamese Dream..but that's not
	Witness.
	<p />
	Furthermore I don't want it to be seen as "jeeesus they were great until he
	got involved"..best to let the great song writing relationships within the
	band continue and grow.
	<p />
	I did demo one thing with Dylan and Ray and Gerard and I never heard them
	mention it again, which I STRESS is not a moan - far from it - they
	probably thought just that it was shit and were to embarrassed to tell me
	straight !!! Just like there is no point in planting seeds in the wrong season,
	there is no point in doing something if you know it ain't going to see the light
	of day - I could write so so so much for them but its a wasted effort as it
	won't be worked on - again this is not a moan - again far far far far from it...
	that is the mechanics of a band - there are embedded ways of song
	writing in every band that are set from day one and that can never be remoulded.
	<p />
	You can pretend they are remoulded but then that's just a pretence before a
	split...Best to think - "if it aint broke" etc I have never
	enjoyed playing music more in my life than with Dylan Ray John and Gerard..they
	have something magical between them and I feel privileged to be involved.
	<p />
	I guess I shall hoard up all these ideas I have and one day unleash them on
	Witness and make a Witness meets Wilco meets Smashing Pumpkins album !!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What music did you listen to as a teenager?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	The first album I ever bought was Never Mind the Bollocks..I had to get my dad to buy it for me as the guy behind the counter refused to sell it to a
	ten year old...My dad was as bit shocked by the title !!!...BUT I was too young to be
	hanging around in shopping precincts for the punk scene. - jesus I was ten I could hardly tie my shoes and the glue I was using was
	for Airfix models - I didn't fit in..but Steve Jones guitar sound on that album is still the
	greatest recorded sound of a guitar - Then I got into metal !!! I was heavily into the metal scene...As with most kids who have an older
	brother, I followed suit..GTR heroes like Angus Young, Van Halen, Jimmy
	Page got me into playing guitar - Bands I listened to were Van Halen, ACDC, Zeppelin that kind of stuff...early Van Halen is still fantastic.
	<p />
	But before all of that, I grew up on 70s DISCO...My mom ran a cocktail bar
	in a 70s 'Studio 54' kind of club - with the bar in the middle of a swimming pool !!!...and Travolta like colour tiles that change colour...It was
	awesome....guys in speedos and girls in bikinis still in platforms and afros!!..out of the pool on to the dance floor..the dance floor was a death
	trap So everyone's on the floor dancing to Chic and my moms behind the bar adding
	yet more blue eyed shadow to her eyes - and for all I know Hugh Hefner could have been there - seriously - it was a bizarre upbringing !!!
	<p />
	So I was really into all that stuff...and easy listening stuff like Bread - amazing group - David Soul !!!...Partridge Family...that kind of stuff too.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">When did you decide to take up a career in music? Was there one defining moment or was it, like thousands of other teenagers, a childhood
	"dream" of becoming a "rock star"?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah I guess it was just a dream that kind of came true..I followed a Degree in Classical music as I was heavily into classical guitar - I was featured
	in Classical guitar magazines around 1988 and represented the county of Avon
	many times at international classical guitar festivals. I was really going that route - then Strangelove got signed and I thought
	well you only get one shot at it. No really defining moment - although when I put on Deep Purples 'Child in
	Time' for the first time and that solo kicks in I'm thinking "man that
	beats homework"
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What was it like and how did things change for you after Strangelove signed for
	Food/Parlophone in 1993?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	It happened very fast for us. We were signed after our second gig. I guess it gave me the opportunity to live in Los Angeles as much as possible. If
	Strangelove weren't doing anything I'd go straight back. It was an amazing period in my life and its fantastic to still be playing with John...
	It changed dramatically once Parlophone came on board - we made a £75,000 video that got shown once and then left them over
	£1 million in debt !!!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What were the highlights of your time in Strangelove?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Recording for two weeks at Abbey Road studios, living in Los Angeles, an 8 week tour with Suede in Europe was incredible - an open air gig in an
	amphitheatre in Granada Spain was the best Strangelove gig - played the Albert Hall that was a buzz.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">
	..and the worst bits...?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Writing the best album ever with John that never got sung to, ...filed under dead letter office..
	</div>
	
	<p class="iview_q">What happened after Strangelove? Did you immediately set about getting back into music, or did you consider a career change?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I realised that the only other thing I could be passionate about was design - I had designed all the sleeves for Strangelove and so I started an HND in
	website design. I still played here and there - I played and toured with a
	girl called Astrid who was in Goya Dress on Suede label Nude...then John called me !!!
	</div>
	
	<p class="iview_q">After joining the band did you find there to be an aspect of naivety towards the music industry amongst the members of the band who were experiencing
	it for the first time?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	No not really - I think its the other way round - most industry types or companies are so naive of how bands work and think. However when Ray said
	he thought they'd sell 25,000 in the first week I did have to wonder!!!.. he then went on to add - "Isn't it normal to have ringing in your ears
	??"..
	<p />
	Anyway they have the best management I have ever witnessed (no pun intended)
	and the band themselves don't have to debate things like royalty rates if Richard Claderman covers Quarantine or "locating mandolin strings in the
	middle of the night in Austin" (Spinal Tarp!!)
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Apart from the one headlining tour last year, the majority of your gigs have been as the support slot. Is it frustrating to play to a crowd that, in
	the main, are not familiar with your music?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Supports are far more enjoyable - you get the chance to win over a new audience and leave the show early if you are bored !!...you can soundcheck
	and then not have to move your gear before the show. As long as the band you are supporting is similar then it will work out great - if we were to tour
	with someone like Billie Piper then I can see problems even before we've left the gas station.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">During your early gigs, Gerard built up a reputation amongst the music press for his "lack of movement" during live performances. This seemed to be
	down to nerves more than anything else. How do you, yourself feel up on stage? You seem to enjoy the experience and don't mind moving around a bit!
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Funny people the press aren't they - Me and John were close to the rise of Oasis having gigged with them and I remember they got GREAT press for not
	moving around ???? How I play is simply how I play .. I like throwing shapes - I guess I do
	what I do...I am very aware that I move around far too much and from here on in I will consciously be stopping it, as it was fine to be jumping around
	like a lunatic in Strangelove or the Jazz Butcher but with Witness its its
	-- well lets just say I'm sitting down at my piano from now on - I think I'm probably making a fool of myself....I'm going to leave it to Ray to throw
	shapes from now on - he can do a great windmill !!!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">
	What has been your most memorable live experience with Witness thus far? Surely not the ridiculously early time you had to be on stage at
	Glastonbury last year?!
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I think it has to be Jools Holland - that was the biggest buzz I have ever had...but that wasn't a gig in true definition - so I guess it was the most
	recent Amsterdam Paridiso show. The gig was so well received - I turned 30 as Heirloom kicked in and I thought "well this beats a cake and
	candles"...actually maybe just the candles, I'll keep the cake.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What were the recent Holland gigs like and why did you play just Holland? Anything to do with the countries
	'relaxed' laws?!
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I guess the previous answer answers this one too - the relaxed laws hardly changed the other 4..can they be more relaxed ???..I don't think so..they
	are so laid back they are horizontal. They should call the next album Coma.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">
	Judging from the feedback I myself have received, you seem to be building up quite a steady fanbase across North America, despite not even having
	released anything over there yet. Are there high hopes for success after
	the impending album release and tour over there?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Very high hopes..high apple pie in the sky hopes !!! I just hope Witness end up at the Madison Square Gardens and not at the Tic
	Toc Inn and Show Boat Casino down the road !!!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What is it like being referred to as a "Wigan" band, when in actual
	fact, Ray is the only member of the band to come from Wigan?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Are you sure that's where he comes from..I think the moon might be a better bet..this guy is so high - he's in orbit...
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Do the constant Verve references tend to get annoying...as though you have to live up to their level of success?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah I guess it does get annoying but I do find myself saying to people "yeah
	we're like early REM and the Verve"...
	Obviously all bands get compared with something, at least we are being compared to the Verve and not the Dixie Chicks...
	I feel the Verve comparisons are beginning to fade, I hear the Counting Crows mentioned more now. I don't think any of us feel any pressure to live
	up to there success - and obviously success is measured in such different
	ways...I think Witness songs are far more emotional than the Verve and that's success to my ears.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Was it disappointing, or at least surprising to not gain any nominations in the majority of the "end of year" polls/awards, especially after the
	amount of praise heaped on you earlier last year? I suppose it just demonstrates
	the fickleness of the British press?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I think it demonstrates peoples lack of intelligence to get so worked up over these polls...even the Oscars mean little now - everyone knows its
	rigged....So what a surprise !! yet another Sony label band win the Brit awards, and the Brits awards is owned by - by - can you guess it - Sony !
	<p />
	Its all a bit Blue Peter "Here's one I made earlier".
	<p />
	Ignore polls - they count for shit unless Witness win one of course !!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">So all the band live in Bristol now? You didn't fancy moving up to Wigan then!
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Me and John were living in this Travel Inn in Wigan - It was the most depressing time of my life...It was so Alan Partridge...I actually did find
	myself walking down the dual carriage way to the gas station to buy something useless like windshield wiper fluid - just to kill time ...
	<p />
	I remember one week I had the same meal every night from the restaurant - "Yeah I'll have the Fish and Chips again" It was groundhog day - the
	only variety in the day was whether to have mushy peas or garden peas !!
	<p />
	I'd be in rehearsal in the daytime and find myself thinking "tonight I'm going to have the garden peas for a change "...it was so awful - beyond
	awful....I'd find myself sat in reception talking to the cleaner about UHT milk.... Without doubt the most depressing time in my whole life.
	<p />
	Also Wigan is not the place for someone in Bell Bottoms...there must be a Wigan Law that states "if you see someone in Bell Bottoms you must stare at
	them like a dog that's just been shown a card trick "... To quote Bill Hicks "in some societies, people are shouting for Revolution
	- In Wigan they are shouting 'EVOLUTION'.."we want our thumbs !!"...the
	family tree up there must be a stump !!!! (no offence intended!!)
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">How's the new album coming along?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Its sounding great...I think the right choice in producer will result in a classic.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Presumably we should expect plenty of new songs about farmers and combine harvesters now you're all West Country inhabitants then!
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yeah we are having real problems with the roosters laying eggs in the back of the amps...
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Any plans to do the UK festivals again this year?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I'm sure will we be in a field near you soon - not for festivals though - for the rooster ranch we are going to need...
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Can you see Witness being around for a long time to come?
	</p>
	
	<div class="iview_a">
	I hope so..I think that over the course of 3 or 4 albums Witness will grow into a very influential band - Problem is these days its hard to find a
	label that is willing to devote development time in a band.. Music and music companies these days are more interested in teenagers and
	the fast buck of some kid who's saved up his pocket money to buy Billie.
	<p />
	Rather than putting Gerard's voice and lyrics on disk its like wait a minute..what's that pre-pubescent teenager saying over there ??..lets put
	her voice on disk so that it can't be erased for ever...Video killed the Radio Star and Major Labels killed Imagination
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What are your main hopes and aims for yourself and the band in the future
	years?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I hope that we get to work on a Tarantino kind of movie or something like that...some American small town cult classic film that we can do the
	soundtrack too. Check out Dakota Suite as they are the most over looked band in the whole of
	musical history and if I was a film maker I'd have used them...they are magnificent....
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">
	Is Witness your main priority in life at the moment then or do you have time to pursue other interests?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes main priority at present..but...I am studying website design HND in Bristol..I did the Witness site and I am currently developing the site for Coalition
	PR which is Robs company (the manager along with Tim) I have my own web design company called Kitty Litter Design...I hope one day
	to float on the FTSE !!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What music are you listening to at the moment? Any recommendations?
	</p>
	
	<div class="iview_a">
	Just got the new Pumpkins album which is fantastic !!
	<p />
	Still listening to favourites like (band - album)
	Scud Mountain boys - Massachusetts
	Nadine - Downtown Saturday
	Josh Rouse - Dressed up like Nebraska
	Sunny Day Real Estate - Diary
	Whiskeytown - Faithless Street
	<p />
	As usual I can't recommend anything from the UK other than The Dakota Suite. Awesome band.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">What do you think of the music scene at the moment and so called "lack
	of new talent"? Does it deserve all the negative publicity that its been getting?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Are you meaning the incessant warblings of Christina Aguilera and the "of course I'm straight" preening of 5IVE ??
	The "lack of new talent" debate has always been there - I'm sure the
	jury was out on David Cassidy and the Brady Bunch but they both went on to get top ten hits. Teen sensations have always been there - unfortunately they
	now rule the music scene..
	<p />
	If you are meaning the lack of new talent in guitar bands then go find some new stuff and don't wait to be told what you should
	like..ever since the lad mag culture exploded people (I'm meaning men here, women are far more
	intelligent to make up there own mind) ..but ever since this lad mag culture people can not think for themselves..they have to be told what to
	wear - don't tell me - combats - how to look - what to drive - to like Gail Porter - and what to listen to...
	<p />
	Flippant reply yes - but not that far from the truth.
	<p />
	People got lazy all of a sudden and forgot the joy in discovering things for themselves...
	Lack of Talent - that doesn't cut it with me...There is so much talent out there you've just got to go find it yourself.
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Is the internet the way forward for music? Will it finally lead to the downfall of the fascist dictators that are the NME and the Melody Maker?
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">
	These publications put together sell less than Beano !!!. Internet is not the way forward to music until a new
	compression format is found. The MP3 format is too big and too slow. When they develop a better
	format then YES the internet is the way forward and then everyone can have a record collection like John Peels !!!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	And finally, a couple of questions from fans on the Witness mailing list:
	<p />
	What equipment do you and Ray use? (from Simon Rand)
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	On my pedal board I have:
	Boss DD5 with tap tempo pedal
	Diaz Sqaure Face Fuzz (custom pedal made by Stevie Ray
	Vaughens roadie)
	Ibanez TS9 tube screamer - (ex Gary Moore!!!)
	MXR Micro Amp - the main part of my sound.
	Boss NS2 - noise gate running a loop for the following
	-
	Ibanez AF9 - (without doubt one of the rareist pedals you could hope to find -
	took me about 2 years of web
	surfing to finally find one in Arizona - mint in box. I've had pedal gurus in
	the UK take photos of it, as it is best example around - its an auto wah
	envelope follower.
	Ibanez PT9 - the Ibanez 9 series from the 70's is the best series of pedals ever
	made and this is a great phaser.
	<p />
	The best source for vintage pedals.
	I have a Pearl Octavia - regarded as one of the best vintage octave by pedal
	gurus as it can go 2 down and 1 down and 1 up and a mix of all three and
	original.
	<p />
	Finally I have a Diaz Tremodillo tremolo pedal with half time switch.
	<p />
	Guitars I use are a:
	Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Pro 1976 (ex Noel Gallagher)
	Gibson Les Paul Deluxe 1980 with bigsby trem (ex Shaking Stevens !!)
	<p />
	Amp is a Vox AC30, used with a powerbrake soak
	<p />
	Ray uses a:
	Fender Telecaster with Lace sensor pickups.and I think he is going to get -
	A Gibson SG from the 60's with Vibrola arm.
	A Tokai Breazer Telecaster.
	<p />
	He plays through a Mesa Boogie Maverick which is an awesome amp..
	<p />
	Pedals are:
	Boss DD5 with Tempo Tap Pedal
	Volume Pedal
	Boss RV3 digital reverb
	Danelectro Daddy O overdrive
	Coloursound Fuzz
	I think he uses some other gadgets but I think the biggest source of sound comes
	from what he inhales !!
	</div>

	<p class="iview_q">Any tips on how to play the Audition riff?  (from William Browne)
	</p>

	<div class="iview_a">Hold the plectrum close to the strings and pinch the string as you pluck so
	you get harmonic overtones. Other than that I don't know what to say - let the
	spirit of Chan enter your fingers !!

	<h2 class="entry-title">The Breathing of Statues: An Interview With Max Eider</h2>

<div class="iview_intro">
In 1987, I heard the news that Max Eider, the guitarist for my beloved heroes The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy had left the band.	
	<p />
Today this kind of information can be sought out instantaneously, but back then if you wanted to find stuff out, you had to dig.	
	<p />
I had it pretty easy because as Music Director of my high school radio station KVHS, I was in touch with indie record company folks on a daily basis, so news like Jonathan Segal leaving Camper Van Beethoven or the release of the Smiths bootleg <em>Better Live Than Dead</em> came generously to me on a regular basis through several different subterranean streams.	
	<p />
I was a massive JBC fan. I owned singles and albums and E.P.s and from the album sleeves to the lyrics to every note they played, I studied the band with ardent devotion. Their songs were warm, funny and heartbreaking and they revealed a strange and slanted world of dead movie stars, girls who kept goldfish, regular English-speaking gentlemen on holidays, love kittens, human jungles and the boast that outer space is “just fantastic.” It was frenetic (“Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present”) but it could also be emotionally devastating (“Angels”) and from breezy acoustic wonders (“Falling In Love”) to swinging rockers (“Rain”) the JBC could do no wrong by me.	
	<p />
With his winning deadpan and whip smart sense of humor, singer Pat Fish had charisma to burn, and Max Eider was his perfect foil, as secret of a weapon as they come. In addition to his brilliant guitar figures and charming background vocals, on each album Eider would pitch in a few tracks here and there of his own. To name a few, there’s the dreamy “The New World,” the symmetrical bop of “Who Loves You Now?” and “Drink” a spare ode to bar life where he declares, “Hope I never get dry before I get old.” Eider and Fish were the ideal team and when news came that their musical partnership had run its course, I was devastated.	
	<p />
And I was lost.	
	<p />
Because there was no Internet to scour, I was left to fend for myself and I didn’t do well: nobody I knew in the music business had any idea what had become of Eider. The Butcher subsequently released <em>Fishcotheque</em>, and it was a great album, but without Max or news of his musical whereabouts, it was hard for me to enjoy it completely.	
	<p />
One Spring day in 1987, a promo copy of Max Eider’s debut solo album <em>The Best Kisser In The World</em> arrived at the radio station straight from Big Time Records and I cut the rest of school, went home immediately and listened to it. From the sweeping pop beauty of “My Other Life” and "Rosemary" to the acoustic shuffle “Sensitive Touch,” to the wrenching ballad “It Has To Be You,” <em>The Best Kisser In The World</em> was a quiet and astonishingly gorgeous album. The severed musical alliance of the JBC, heartbreaking as it was, had yielded two separate camps and since they both sounded great, I could live with that.	
	<p />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLmMA7VGv9w' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>	
	<p />
By 1992, however, I was getting worried. Three years had passed and aside from his appearance on David J.’s wonderful trio of solo albums (<em>Songs From Another Season</em>, <em>Urban Urbane, Crocodile Tears and the Velvet Cosh</em>) Max Eider had all but dropped out of sight. The Butcher was cranking out excellent albums like <em>Big Planet, Scary Planet, </em><em>Cult of the Basement </em>and <em>Condition Blue</em>, but where was Max Eider?	
	<p />
I wouldn't find out for nine more years.	
	<p />
In 2001, Max Eider quietly released <em>Hotel Figueroa</em> on the Vinyl Japan label; rich and rhythmic, it was the perfect follow-up to <em>The Best Kisser In The World</em>. Rich and rhythmic, <em>Hotel Figueroa</em> was a meditative, quietly stunning blend of jazzy ballads (“The Long Night”), slow motion rags (“Lazy Bones”) and sneaky rhythms (“Sweet End”).	
	<p />
It was totally worth the wait. Hard to stay mad at the guy.	
	<p />
Six short years later, the release of <em>Back In The Bedroom</em> finds Eider completing a musical triptych. Recorded in the musician’s bedroom of his London home, the album is loaded with Eider’s effortless gliding cadences. There’s the gently swaying opener “I Want,” the prowling jazz of “Secret Life” and the rolling, graceful pop of “Love’s Blind,” but those don’t even scratch the surface of how deep this album goes. Fueled by Eider’s decidedly brilliant guitar work coupled with his euphonious and warm delivery, <em>Back In The Bedroom</em> is an eleven-song collection of sheer sonic elegance. Pulling out songs as highlights is a necessary, albeit academic exercise, but allow me to continue in this adorational indulgence: “Sweet Nothing” comes with an understated, but undulating rhythm punctuated by a sublime saxophone; “Stupid Heart” is a sweeping wonder and “Kings And Queens” is a silky number about keeping our dreams company in spite of the realities and consequences of normal life.	
	<p />
As a songwriter, Eider is sophisticated and intellectual, but he’s able to keep his themes and subjects quite singular and it’s this level of focus that makes his work so appealing. Not only that, he manages in his musical phrasing a vocal precision that imbues every number with a poetic poignancy. But Eider’s greatest strength may very well be his sense of proportion - a balance between the song, the song’s instrumental composition, lyrical intent and performer’s presence. I know that I didn’t just unearth a never before considered trinity of sonic ingredients, but it’s that last component that can either commandeer the ship anywhere it wants, or sink the bastard to the murky depths of nowhere. And while music critics are quick to talk about composition and lyrical intent, presence has been getting the short shrift for a long time even though it’s of absolute importance. Max Eider is one of the rare musicians working today (Justin Currie, Joe Henry and Mark Knopfler also come to mind) who has a preternatural sense of how to present a pop song—how to measure it, how to embody it, how to live inside of it. Perhaps Orlando Gibbons described it best way back in 1612's <em>The First Set Of Gibbons</em> when he wrote: “It is proportion that beautifies every thing, this whole Universe consists of it, and Musicke is measured by it.”	
	<p />
And that, my friends, is why Max Eider’s songs are so—I want to say beautiful, but that falls far short of what I mean—<em>vital.</em> He accomplishes in his music what Rilke referred to as “the breathing of statues.”	
	<p />
Listen closely and you’ll see what I mean; listen closely and you’ll hear those stone giants exhale across the garden.	
	<p />
We sat down with Max for a chat and the first thing we asked was where he'd vanished to in 1987.	
	<p />
"One particular night in L.A. involving Joe Strummer and industrial quantities of tequila sticks in the mind," he answered...	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">Stereo Embers: What is your earliest memory of playing guitar?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p />Max Eider: My earliest musical memory is of trying to pick out Beatles tunes on the piano when I was very young—about 6 or 7. I was a big fan. But I didn't start playing guitar until I was 15. I formed a band with some friends and then we argued for weeks about who'd play what. I wanted to be the drummer, but I ended up on guitar. I borrowed a warped old acoustic from my sister's boyfriend and cut my fingers to shreds trying to learn chords from a book. This was well before punk, and we were mainly listening to progressive rock—Caravan, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, that sort of thing—so the result, as you can imagine, was hideous. I suppose we hoped we'd look cool and impress girls. The reverse happened. However, for some reason, I persevered.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: What were the bands like that you were in early on?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Well, they were pisspoor, of course. Initially we wanted to sound something like <em>Ummagumma</em>-period Pink Floyd. But luckily our bassist's older brother, John Silver (more about John later), strongly advised us to stop arsing around and learn how to play a few Chuck Berry numbers. No better place to start. However, around that time we also started dabbling with LSD and spending long periods listening awestruck to Gong records, so we soon reverted to feeble attempts at prog/psychedelic rock. Still, at least by then we knew how to play a 12-bar.	
	<p />
At university there was a series of groups, of which the best by some distance was a band called the Sonic Tonix, formed by the aforementioned John Silver, with Owen Jones, who later joined the Jazz Butcher, on drums. By that time Punk had arrived and most of us were deeply embarrassed about a large section of our record collections. John was writing some good, quirky, spiky stuff, and Pat Fish and I were drafted in on vocals and guitar respectively. I replaced the original guitar player, Simon Mawby (later of The Woodentops). Pat and I had previously been in another band called The Institution, which had Rolo—who went on to form The Woodentops—on bass. I still know all these people.	
	<p />
Pat and I were both writing the occasional song at this time, but nothing either of us would care to remember. As a guitar player too, I had yet to find my way. However, at one point quite early on, one of the most accomplished musicians knocking around at the time came up to me after a gig and told me that I was the best amateur guitarist he'd ever heard. I was amazed, and I knew it was a misjudgment, but all the same I'd fooled him, and the compliment probably made me take my playing a bit more seriously.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: When you say that it made you take your playing more seriously, how did that change the way you approached the instrument?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Well, I suppose I devoted more time to the tedious business of developing a bit of technique, as well as trying to work out how other players did what they did and learning a bit of theory.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">Se: Do you recall your first meeting with Pat Fish? Was there an instant synergy between you guys?</div>
	<p />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/BUAM4s_ODng?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>	
	<p />
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I don't remember exactly how we first met, but we had mutual friends and we were both playing in bands so it was bound to happen. Small pond. We got on well from the start. He was charismatic, charming and very sharp. And we had some of the same enthusiasms: for the Velvets, Eno and Television, for example, and we both still liked some of that hippy shit  -  Kevin Ayers was and still is a particular favourite for us both, for example. Plus we were both quite keen on getting soused to the gills.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: One thing I always liked about the JBC was the way Pat would refer to you in songs—those "take a look at Max" moments were so cool because no one else was doing that. Were those references spontaneous?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Yes, originally at least. It was important for Pat that songs and shows weren't the same night after night, and he's good at improvising chat and even lyrics. He was always making me laugh at a crucial moment, either with some unexpected variation, or with an aside on mike or in my ear. There was a lot of laughter on stage in the early JBC—and in the re-formed version, come to that.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: So after you left the JBC in 1987 where in the devil did you disappear to?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> In fact I played on three David J records in all: <em>Crocodile Tears and the Velvet Cosh</em>, <em>Songs From Another Season</em>, and <em>Urban Urbane</em>. And we toured the U.S. twice. This was a lot of fun after all the grief of the JBC split and the bankruptcy of the label who put out my first solo album. One particular night in L.A. involving Joe Strummer and industrial quantities of tequila sticks in the mind. In the late 80’s and early 90’s I wrote some songs, and I did a couple of demos, and I did a show or two in London and Hamburg. But really as a solo artist I couldn't get arrested, and having spent a few years banging my head against a brick wall, I just thought: OK, on the whole it's been a blast, but I guess it's time to move on.	
	<p />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='700' height='424' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZlOErCDwc4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>	
	<p />
Where did I disappear to? Well, apart from a brief sojourn in the wilds of Gloucestershire, working on what I thought would be the follow-up to <em>The Best Kisser</em>, I was in London, living, loving, working, drinking, doing the odd gig or session for friends, writing the occasional song, spending long periods curled up in the fetal position—you know, doing what people do.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: You had tracks appear on several of the JBC albums ("Drink" or "Who Loves You Now?")—by the time The Best Kisser In The World was released in 1987, had the notion of a solo album been germinating in you for a long time? In other words, did you have a satchel of songs that had long before been filled to the brim?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I probably had about half of that album written before I left the JBC, and the idea of making a solo album must have occurred to me. I had written those songs, and I wanted to write more, but the JBC was essentially Pat's vehicle, and I knew Pat was too gifted and prolific for the JBC to allow me the songwriting space I increasingly wanted. And to some extent we were moving in different directions: I wanted to write tunes, and he, at that point at least, was more interested in the sound, and in making a harder noise.	
	<p />
Having said that, the split, when it came, was more about personal tensions. I thought he was becoming paranoid, borderline psychotic. It was only later that I realized that he probably, and with some justification, thought the same about me. We were drinking far too much, spending too much time with our heads up our own backsides, on the road, in the studio, back on the road. It's a familiar story.	
	<p />
The break was traumatic, for me at least, but I think it was the best thing for both of us. <em>The Best Kisser</em> disappeared more or less without trace, but at least I'd made the damn thing. And my leaving gave Pat something of a fresh start. Certainly he went on to do some of his best stuff without me—if I'm honest, the very best: <em>Cult of the Basement</em> and <em>Condition Blue</em> in particular are stunning albums.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: Can you describe the recording process for Back In The Bedroom— how did it differ from the recording you've done in the past?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> The whole thing was recorded and mixed on a Mac in my home studio, over a period of two years or more. We'd used a computer for the drum tracks on the re-formed Jazz Butcher album, <em>Rotten Soul</em>, but apart from that all the recording I've been involved in was done in a traditional way, in a studio, with ‘live' backing tracks. That wasn't feasible in this case, so before I even started I had to spend ages getting to grips with the software and learning some engineering skills.	
	<p />
I really didn't want to make an album that sounded like someone sitting in front of a computer, but I did a couple of trials, and the results were encouraging, so I set about it. It's a slow and painstaking business, but in a way working like this suits me, so even if I had an unlimited budget, I'd probably do something similar next time—though I might go into a decent studio with a good drummer to get the basic backing tracks. And I probably wouldn't record the saxophone at home, for the sake of the neighbours.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: Do you find the home recording process more liberating than how it was done in the past? Is this a more intimate way of going about things</em>?	<p />
<div class="iview_a"><p /> It gives you the time to explore different ideas: to get things wrong and to get things right. And it gives you the chance to try arrangements and instrumentation that were traditionally only possible on a very large budget. And yes, in a way it is more intimate. Of my three solo albums, the new one is definitely the closest to the sound that I had in my head.	
	<p />
The disadvantages are that, however good the software—and these days it is very good—recording and mixing music is an art in itself, and takes a lot of learning; there's no one to tell you when you're disappearing up your own fundament; no one to say ‘For chrissake Max, that's good enough', or ‘Sorry, mate, but you really should do that again', or ‘Do you really think that's wise?'; no one to bounce ideas off or provide ideas; no one to have a laugh with or shout at. There isn't the excitement and atmosphere of a fixed period in a studio, when you go in with nothing down and know you have to come out two weeks later or whatever with an album. I'm not complaining: if modern computer-based recording technology weren't available, I wouldn't have a new album, and there wouldn't be any more in the future, and then where would we all be?	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: Is it odd to belt out a song across the hall from where you sleep or eat breakfast?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Yes—my studio really is in the bedroom, though there's a partition. Poor Tama. I got used to it, but I'm not sure she ever did.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: The sequencing on Back In The Bedroom is just perfect and that it starts with "I Want" and ends with "Kings and Queens" seems, from a thematic perspective, a genius move. What, if you can reveal, is the strategy here?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> It all just seemed to slot together more or less of its own accord. Of course, these days a lot of people have ‘shuffle' switched on permanently, but what can you do? I should point out, in case anyone is considering actually buying the album, that “Kings and Queens” is an extra track on the CD. The download version ends with “It's Come To This”—which is where, originally, I had intended the album to end. “Kings and Queens” just popped out as I was beginning to do the mixing and demanded inclusion.

	<p />
<div class="iview_q">SE: One of the themes that seems to keep rearing its head is longing and more than a touch of regret. The narrators of "My Dreams" and "Dirty Old Man" seem wistful as much as anything else—was this what you were after? And more importantly, what are we to do with regret in the real world? Should have called her back, should have gone to New Zealand, should have studied for that last exam....</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> There's longing, certainly, and sadness, but regret is not what I had in mind. In “Dirty Old Man”, “every dog among you had his day.” And the narrator of “My Dreams” has left his regret behind, or thinks he has. It's just that however wise and avuncular you may think you have become, most of us, men and women, are still prey to longing and desire—and inappropriate lust, to call a spade a spade—that we can't control. Or is it just me? Of course, you can and usually should refrain from acting on such feelings. Also there's the question of whether or not you really want to be rid of them, and this is one source of the sadness. Because unless you're really capable of spending the rest of your life sitting serenely under a fig tree, you're stuck with it, boyo.	
	<p />
I should also say, in case this all sounds plain pitiful, that yearnings and desires of this sort are clearly comic as well as pathetic, and both of these songs are supposed to be funny as well as sad. In the case of “My Dreams,” I heard that phrase “I hope all your dreams come true” somewhere, and I thought: my god, what a thing to wish on someone. And I suddenly felt a country ballad coming on.	<p />
</div>
<iv class="iview_q">SE: The notion of one's dreams coming true does seem like a peculiar kind of curse—it seems like without a struggle tedium must inevitably come in. I realize this isn't much of a question, but an observational response to what you said about "My Dreams"—reminds me of when Robyn Hitchcock told me he thought hell would be far more interesting than heaven. Do you agree?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> The company would certainly be more interesting. It's the old paradox of <em>Paradise Lost</em>: who's more interesting/sympathetic, God or Satan? No contest. Incidentally, I wasn't thinking that boredom would be the problem if someone's dreams came true, but chaos—in other words it would be much more like most people's idea of hell than heaven.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: I always go back to The Graduate—you got the girl, you defeated the system, you're on your way. But she's technically married, you're on a bus going who knows where and…well, chaos ensues. That look on Hoffman's face registers sheer happiness and then deep uneasiness. And it stays that way.</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Plus you'd been shagging her mother for ages, and maybe, just maybe, she might resent that in the years to come. It's a fantastic moment isn't it? You get your Hollywood happy ending, and then, as you say, just with that look everything is undermined and opened up. Brilliant.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: And what of regret?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Regret: well, personally, I regret a good deal. Begging the pardon of Edith Piaf and whoever wrote that song, if you regret nothing, you're probably either an idiot or a psychopath. But unless it can lead to a positive change in behaviour, regret is a pointless and destructive emotion and should be stifled at birth—which I suppose is what that Piaf song is really about.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: From a lyrical perspective, do you find yourself returning to similar themes?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> To some extent, yes, though of course the perspective changes. On first impression a lot of my lyrics probably seem to deal with the most hackneyed pop themes—love and heartbreak—and to be very personal. And some of them do/are, of course: if you're going through a barren period, the thing most likely to move you to write a song is having your damn heart broken. A couple of the tracks I contributed to the Jazz Butcher album <em>Rotten Soul</em> fall into this category. For a while I didn't seem to be able to write a lyric at all unless at some point it went "baby, baby, baby." And there are quite a few songs from other periods about relationships that are over, but they're not all my relationships, thank god, and in most cases it's not the heartache that interests me, but what happens after that. “Other Kinds of Love” (<em>Hotel Fig</em>) is an earlier example of this, and on the new album “Closing Time,” “Stupid Heart,” and “It's Come To This.”	
	<p />
I suppose one of my main preoccupations is how much time we all spend wanting things—and people—we don't/can't have; wanting to be something we're not; wanting to get somewhere else; wanting more, different, or better. This is not a recipe for happiness and peace of mind, obviously. But it <em>is</em> a recipe for just about everything else humans are capable of. Hardly an original insight, but there you are. Quite a few of the songs touch on this in some way or other.Self-absorption and communication failure also crop up repeatedly. No idea why, doctor. What else? Well, there are a couple of drinking songs, and three that deal with death-wish or suicide—but in an uplifting kind of way, you understand.	
	<p />
To be honest I've never really given this much thought before and there's a danger of making it all seem more considered and coherent than it really is. When I'm writing, I'll write about anything I think I can get a song out of, and I'd guess it's the same for pretty much everyone else. Sometimes the spark may just be a person you notice in the street, or something you read, or some trivial incident or remark or thought that stuck in the memory or you put in a notebook. And in many cases, once is definitely enough. You don't want to write more than one song about the death of your mother, for instance. Or at least I don't.

	<p />
<div class="iview_q">SE: "Stupid Heart" is a song that seems to insist that we make the same mistakes in love and that we refuse to see the truth even when we know the truth. In other words, the heart does what it wants even when it knows it's entering choppy, inadvisable waters. And yet we still go there!</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Over the years I have been amazed at my own and others' failure to learn from experience. Actually, as you suggest, it's not so much that you don't learn, it's just very hard to apply the relevant lesson when it counts. But it does get a bit easier as you get older: the heart probably doesn't get much less stupid, but you're less inclined to let it make a complete dick of you yet again. So, on a personal note, although it may not always sound like it from the songs, I am in fact in a stable and happy relationship and have been for many years.	
	<p />
As I see it, “Stupid Heart” is essentially about accepting that the heart can be perverse and idiotic without giving up on it altogether, without becoming hardened or bitter. OK, so you can't have what you wanted—why not try to love your stupid/crooked neighbour with your stupid/crooked heart instead? (Incidentally I'd better admit here that I nicked this line from Auden.)	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: "It's Come To This" brings to mind similar issues— saw it coming, refused to move—reminds me of Pat's "You can see the cars, you just can't get out of their way...." What did you have in mind here from a lyrical standpoint?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Yeah that's a good line of Pat's isn't it? The original idea for this song came from a chance meeting with someone I hadn't seen for maybe 15 years. I noticed him across the room in a pub—unmistakably him—and I was sure he'd spotted me as well, and I thought about going over, but then I thought: what's the point, for the sake of a few minutes' awkward smalltalk and an exchange of phone numbers that neither of us would ever call? And he'd clearly reached the same conclusion, because when I looked up a few minutes later, he'd gone. And I thought: it's come to this. Sad but not sad. The incident stayed with me for some reason, but when I came to write the song, ‘he' became ‘she', and the friendship became a love affair. It just worked better that way. Yes, the fact that both crossed the road knowing the high risk of being run over became a important element in the song, as well as the fact that, at the time, you can't act on basis that it will probably will "come to this." Or that. But always, of course, the other.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: What challenges continue to present themselves for you when it comes to songwriting? Have you found that it comes easier than it did, say, twenty years ago?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> It does come more easily now, and that's because I always used to start with the music, but now, more often than not, I start with the words—or at least with some sort of idea for a lyric, however slight. Once I've got that, I usually find the music more or less writes itself. If you do it the other way around you tend to end up with tapes/discs full of musical ideas that never become songs. Or at least I do. Challenges? I just want to do it while I can. My greatest regret, as far as music is concerned, is that I will never know what the album I was planning to make after<em> The Best Kisser</em> would have sounded like, or the album(s) I might have made in the 90’s. I don't plan to feel the same way about the next decade. But I'm not exactly prolific, so don't hold your breath.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: You've now completed a solo album triptych—and it's a lovely body of work. What are you future plans in terms of recording a 4th (and #'s 5-15)?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Over the past year or more I've been getting ideas I wanted to pursue that didn't really fit the mood of this album. The next one will be darker, god help me, and probably more of a piece thematically. It will be done in more or less the same way as I've done this one.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: On the subject of the musicians that appear on Back In The Bedroom— I notice that June Miles-Kingston and Marc Hadley, who were both on Best Kisser reappear. They sound lovely, by the way! How did getting them back on board come about?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> June's been on board pretty much throughout. I met her originally through Simon Mawby of the Woodentops, and he'd met her when the Wooodentops did some dates with Everything But The Girl, who she was with at the time. June wasn't on <em>Hotel Fig</em>, but only because that was recorded in LA and she couldn't make it to the sessions. June's a wonderful singer (and drummer)— her career speaks for itself—and despite the fact that she has so much more natural talent in the vocal department than I do, our voices seem to complement each other. I hadn't been in touch with Marc for years, but a couple of tracks were crying out for a bit of saxophone, and it seemed appropriate to ask him. I had no idea where he was but I Googled him and tracked him down via some jazz club in Cornwall he'd been gigging at recently. Another lifer.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: What's your plan in terms of live gigs? Have you assembled a band and if so, will it consist of the players on the album? Do you enjoy playing live?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I have no plans to play live. I might make some if I got a bit of a bite on the album and I thought I could fill a room or two. Gigs presenting my solo stuff have been few and far between. If there's no regular band, it's a hell of a lot of work to put one together for a single evening, and it doesn't end up sounding that good, because a band only really gels after it's been gigging regularly for a while. Probably the most successful shows I did playing my solo stuff were a few dates supporting the JBC in Japan—just me and a guitar, with Owen Jones on accordion on a couple of numbers. In the very early Jazz Butcher days, playing live was a joy, though touring got a bit grim later on. I enjoyed the David J tours, and when Pat and I got back together again towards the end of the 90’s, that was a blast as well, because all the pressure had gone. We were all getting on very well and the band —Pat and I, and Owen on drums, and Steve Valentine on bass—was razor-sharp: much better than we'd been the first time around. Not surprising I suppose. But despite this, as time went on and the novelty of the reunion wore off, the audiences got smaller and smaller. Pat will turn up in a country pub on a Sunday night and play to two men and a dog if someone asks him to, and I admire him for it. As far as he's concerned, it's what he does, so he does it. But I started to find it all a bit disheartening. I don't feel the same drive to play live that I still feel to write and record. But I wouldn't rule anything out.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: Can you talk about the album art? That rendering of you by Dave Coverly is terrific. How did that come about?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I've known Dave for years: he was a JBC fan, and also a fan of <em>The Best Kisser</em>, and we became friends. I love his work. He did a caricature of me for <em>Hotel Fig</em>, and when he offered his services again for the new album, I jumped at the chance. The designer Mau Carey also made a big contribution to the artwork.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: A quick question about recurring iconography—Coverly's rendering of the bedroom shows a copy of Hotel and a painting of Best Kisser on the wall—am I nuts or is that correct?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Do I have to choose one or the other? You're right anyway. The painting was a painting (by an artist friend called Melanie Toney) before it was an album cover, and it <em>is</em> hung on the wall of my studio. I asked Dave to put in a reference to <em>Hotel Fig</em> as well, because despite the fact that the three albums span almost exactly 20 years, and are certainly not ‘concept' albums, let alone a concept triple album, I had a sense that <em>Back in the Bedroom</em> was in a way, as you suggested, the final part of a trilogy—kind of rounding off unfinished business. The <em>Best Kisser</em> painting, of two fish in the sea nose to nose (do fish have noses?), but one in a bowl, would work as a cover for any of the three albums. Incidentally the painting is supposed to act as a kind of ironic comment on the title ‘The Best Kisser in the World', though at the time it's true that I was happy to try to demonstrate my claim with suitable applicants.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: The guitar is so little discussed among my friends—when I was 12 we used to talk about Randy Rhodes and Eddie Van Halen but when I discovered punk and post-punk and new wave and indie rock, I found that very few people talk about individual players and their separate skills.</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Absolutely: it's one of the most enduring legacies of the punk era that, except in jazz and some sorts of heavy rock, most people aren't much interested in individual musicians, and a lot of musicians feel almost as if they're doing something wrong if anyone notices that they're very skilled, or their playing really stands out.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: What guitarists do you admire that are currently out there still playing? I've never played, but my favorite guitarists are yourself, Knopfler and Roddy Frame, Edwyn Collins. Any thoughts on those fellows?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I'm flattered to be included in the list you give. Quite recently I saw two of my all-time favourites, Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd, in the re-formed Television, but I was a little disappointed. In 1977 <em>Marquee Moon</em> went completely against the grain by featuring a lot of intricate guitar work, but what made it so special was that there wasn't a single superfluous note. The guitars weren't tacked on, they were as crucial to the songs as the vocal line. But at the show I saw, there was a good deal of aimless noodling. Maybe there always was, live. I admire players with a distinctive style and sound, but you can take individuality too far. For example, I'm a huge fan of Carlos Alomar, whose rhythm guitar defined the sound of that wonderful mid-period Bowie, from <em>Young Americans</em> through <em>Station to Station</em>, <em>Low</em> and <em>Lodger</em> all the way up to <em>Scary Monsters</em>. But Robert Fripp's mannered pyrotechnics on a couple of the same albums now irritate the hell out of me.	
	<p />
I mentioned Kevin Ayers earlier, and two of his guitar players made a big impression when I was at my most impressionable: Ollie Halsall (now dead, sadly) and, more improbably perhaps, Mike Oldfield. In fact, hearing Oldfield's solo on the title track of <em>Whatevershebringswesing</em> was a pivotal moment for me. It's long but it's gorgeous: simple, clean, melodic, and beautifully crafted. It sounds easy to play but it isn't. Annoyingly, Oldfield was only 17 when the album was recorded. I thought to myself: yes, I've seen the bleeding light, this is the way, sod all that rock/blues pentatonic posturing, get melodic, Eider, play tunes. Of course, I was completely stoned at the time.	
	<p />
As you can see, I have my finger very much on the pulse.

<div class="iview_q">SE: How many guitars do you own and what, if pressed, is your favorite?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> I've never been a collector and I currently have only three guitars, all of which are old friends. There's the first half-decent instrument I ever owned—a Japanese classical guitar; there's the first decent electric guitar I ever owned—a Yamaha; and there's a vintage Gretsch Double Anniversary semi-acoustic, which I bought with my first decent royalty cheque. That Gretsch has been everywhere with me and there can't have been many days in the last 25 years when I haven't played it at some point. If I woke to find the building on fire, I'd grab my Gretsch before my trousers.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: What is your proudest professional moment?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> Wow, that's a tricky one. D'you know I really think it was probably listening the mastered white label of <em>Back in the Bedroom</em>. I know artists always say they think their latest album is the best—you have to think that at the time—but I really believe this one is my best. And it had been such a monumental effort, such a long labour of love. The studio playback of the final mix of <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>, all those years ago, was also a special moment. I was thinking: hey, wait a minute, we're really on to something here.	<p />

	<p />
“Night and Day” (Cole Porter)	
	<p />
“Someone To Watch Over Me” (George and Ira Gershwin)	
	<p />
“If You See Her, Say Hello” (His Bobness)

<div class="iview_q">SE: Your music has taken you all over the world—you must have an endless satchel of stories to tell. What was the most bizarre predicament you found yourself in?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> To give you some idea of how rich a seam you are inviting me to mine, I will simply describe the last gig I did with Pat, in summer 2006. We've always enjoyed doing private functions for fans—weddings and so on—and this one was a big birthday bash, at an isolated house in the middle of a forest in Yorkshire. There were three brothers, and they all loved the Jazz Butcher. The trouble was, it wasn't their party; it was a party they were throwing for their father's 60th birthday. So although the family treated us as honoured guests, the assembled company mainly consisted of their father's friends and business associates, including the local Member of Parliament, none of whom of course had any knowledge of—or interest in—the JBC. We asked what time they'd like us to play and they gave us a copy of the order of events. We were on between the falconry display and the hog roast.

<div class="iview_a"><p /> I've never really wanted to do anything else, but I couldn't strictly speaking be said to have had a career in rock and roll either. I <em>was</em> briefly a teacher, though at a tutorial college not at a university, and for the last 15 years or so I've made a living on and off as a freelance writer and editor. As far as I can remember, at no point, even at my most paranoid and psychotic, have I wanted to run for office and rule the world.	<p />
</div>
<div class="iview_q">SE: And lastly, if you had to choose a line from a poem or a song that best sums up the way you feel about the world, what might that be?</div>
<div class="iview_a"><p /> This is from a novel, Beckett's <em>Molloy</em>, but it kind of hits the spot: “And as for myself, that unfailing pastime, I must say it was far now from my thoughts. But there were moments when it did not seem so far from me, when I seemed to be drawing towards it as the sands towards the wave, when it crests and whitens, though I must say this image hardly fitted my situation, which was rather that of the turd waiting for the flush.”	<p />

<h2>
ALEX GREEN & THE SINISTER DUCKS – AN INTERVIEW
</h2>
<div class="iview_intro">
In an exclusive interview for APOLLOX, Max Akropolis (A.K.A Mr. Alex Green) talks about the project that spawned perhaps one of the rarist singles from the early Eighties.... During his time with Bauhaus, David J. had an extra marital affair the result of this affair was the bastard spawn.... The Sinister Ducks; A Northampton based three piece, the Ducks were the above mentioned Max Akropolis, Captain Jose Da Silva (David J.) and the Translucia Baboon (Alan Moore). The origin of the band can be traced as far back as1978 when Alex had placed an advert in the Northampton Chronicle and Echo, seeking musicians for a band he was putting together....but first a little history.
</div>

<div class="iview_q"> Can you begin by giving a brief explanation of the various bands
that you have been involved with?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> 'Escalator'(1976-1980)An embarrassing Northampton jazz-funk band. The line up included Adrian Utley, now in PORTISHEAD, and the excellent drummer Coach York who later played on David's 'Crocodile Tears' album. Stanton Walgrave (1976-1978) Wildly avant-garde outfit that attempted everything from Henry Cow style multiple time signatures to Faustian free improvisations. Line up included Glyn Bush & Pickle. 'The Mystery Guests' (1978-1979) Avant-Garde three piece comprising, myself, Pickle and Buster Skinner. We covered the 'News At Ten' theme. We also supported Bauhaus at early gigs. 'The Emperors Of Ice Cream' (1978-1979) The dream band that never got beyond rehearsals. All music and lyrics by myself and Alan Moore. Much of this material was performed by Glyn Bush's Birmingham-based band THE DEGO TEE's. 'The Army' (1980-1982)Ska Reggae, line up included Adrian and Coach again, two singles were released. (1982-1985)Self-imposed exile in Sweden, except for a couple of guest appearances and 'THE SINISTER DUCKS' of course. 'The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy'(1986-1995)plus many sessions with David J. Kevin Haskins, Spacemen Three ETC...ETC...

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> So how and why did THE SINISTER DUCKS come to exist in the first place?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> The genesis of THE DUCKS is dark and mysterious by its very nature.
This odd birth must have occurred during one of my return visits to England. I had known Alan Moore since '76 and David since '78. I can remember that we were all hell bent on total world domination by the stealthiest means.

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> Was the project ever 'serious'?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> Yes, it was always deadly serious.

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> Tell me a little about the recording of the single.

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> The Single was recorded at Beck Studios in Northampton (Wellingborough). 'March Of The Sinister Ducks' was built up in layers on top of a basic structure of Dave's guitar and piano. The cabaret saxophones on the choruses were augmented with kazoos played by Alan and myself. Vocals and duck effect came later. 'Old Gangsters Never Die' was recorded live with us all together in the same room, I seem to recall that the version released was the third take.

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> Do THE DUCKS still actually exist or is the thing extinct ?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> Evidence would suggest that THE DUCKS may not currently exist. We don't exactly get together, but I last saw Alan about three weeks ago, and will be seeing Dave later this month (September).

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> How did you manage to get the single released in the first place,
surely Dave's involvement with Situation Two must have been beneficial
having put out his debut solo album out at around the time of the single?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> As you have guessed, the single was accomplished on the coat tails of
Dave's solo work for Situation Two.

</div>

<div class="iview_q"> How did yourself and David get together with Alan for this project then ?

</div>

<div class="iview_a"> I first met Alan in '76 when STANTON WALGRAVE were invited to do the music for the play 'Another Suburban Romance'. This great surrealist drama, a cross between Beckett and Peyton Place, had been written by Alan and Jamie Detano and was then in rehearsal. Glyn Bush and Pickle wrote an incredibly complex score which was exhaustingly perfected and mostly recorded only for the project to founder when a couple of actors dropped out. 
'Old Gangsters Never Die' was originally a soliloquy in the play. After this I kept in close touch with Alan -- amongst other things we worked on the material that would subsequently become the set for the EMPERORS, when we had a dozen songs ready I placed an advert in the Chronicle & Echo seeking fellow conspirators -- this would have been October or November 1978. Dave was one of the respondents -- we met in the Angel Hotel. Although he was really into the idea of the EMPERORS he couldn't stop talking about this other band, BAUHAUS l919. Subsequently he did not have any spare time for several years and so had no involvement with the EMPERORS -- and did not in fact, meet Alan until years later.

Contrary to the above statement, I first met Alan two days after that fateful rendezvous with mister Green. Ushered into a dank basement flat in Colwyn road, Northampton, I became the delighted witness to a scene straight out of Kerouac's 'The Subterraneans'. There was the imposing figure of Alan Moore holding forth in the center of the small room, the walls of which were covered with reversed posters, picture side facing the wall(!), proclaiming that "Old Gangsters Never Die!" Whilst Alex blew smoky ribbons of saxophone sound , a sandy haired angelic looking boy known as 'Seaweed' scratched at a cheap electric guitar and the strange and inscrutable Doctor Pickle a.k.a. Mr. Liquorice ran skeletal fingers over the keys of an ancient Wurlitzer. Various small time criminals and denizens of the local underground art scene nodded approvingly in the sepulchral corners. I also nodded and eventually joined in.

<div class="iview_intro">
To coincide with the re-release of Crocodile Tears and The Velvet Cosh we caught up with David’s former band mate, album session player, sleeve note writer and fellow Northamptonian Pat fish a.k.a The Jazz Butcher to discuss his part in this seminal album…
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Apollox:
David joined The Jazz Butcher in April of 1984 and left in February of ’85 (to join Daniel and Kevin in a new project: Love And Rockets) and the album (Crocodile Tears) was issued in March of ’85. So he was recording whilst still an active member of the Jazz Butcher correct?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
Pat Fish:
Very  much so.  As I said in the sleeve notes, David doesn’t like to try and put together a whole bunch of recordings at once. He prefers brief guerilla strikes with usually quite specific objectives. In 1984 the Jazz Butcher thing was a going concern as a band, playing mostly in London, but we still had lots of days when there was nothing to do. Max (Eider) and I would fill these voids with our day jobs. David would do much the same, writing and recording being, of course, his day job already.
Sometimes the whole of the Jazz Butcher band would be at one of David’s sessions, like the one at Woodbine that produced “Too Clever By Half” and “Ship of Fools”. Sometimes we wouldn’t know what he’d been up to until he played us the results.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
You played flute on Justine, how did you become involved in the sessions? 
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
I can’t recall the exact mechanism by which Dave offered me the session. It is quite possible that he sent me a postcard! Mitch Jenkins and I didn’t have a phone between us at home in those days. I definitely went over on the bus.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
I have known you a long time now and have never come across a correlation between the flute and you before (or since) – Why the flute? 
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
I’m surprised you missed the flute thing. It was actually the first instrument that I learned, though my teacher was kind enough to switch me to a tenor sax, which is a bit more rock and roll. But both instruments work much the same way. I play flute on “Chinatown” and “Goldfish” on the “Bath Of Bacon” album. Also  on “Buffalo Shame” on “Distressed Gentlefolk”. I played flute on the “Recurring” album by Spacemen 3 too. Not many people who can say they have played a flute with the psychedelic stormtroopers of Rugby, but I can honestly put my hand up to that one. The saxes on “A Scandal In Bohemia” & “Distressed Gentlefolk” are me as well.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Let’s talk about your writing of the sleeve notes for this re-issue of Crocodile Tears…did you use a blue print for your text? (like playing the album again)
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
Well, I knew that I would need some kind of a theme. Certainly I played the record a lot and I spent time trying to remember those days as though I was there. Sounds daft, I know, but I have quite a powerful long-term photographic memory and I was 
actively seeking to re-experience what it was like to be young and making music in Northampton in 1983/4.
	<p />
I was trying to see how it would have looked from Dave’s eyes as well, which is something that would never have occurred to me to do when I was young and pissed. I was trying to relate in my mind the things Dave was writing about on the record and how it must have felt for him to be living the life he was living at the time, out of Bauhaus and hanging around with a bunch of people that nobody had ever heard of while they drank Special Brew and chased women. I seem to remember there was quite a lot of that in Northampton at the time.
	<p />
So I settled on a sort of change/downsizing/integrity thrust, which I think went some way towards conveying at least part of what the album is about.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
You don’t mention any of the extra tracks in your notes was this conscious?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
I simply hadn’t heard them at that point. I only received MP3s of the additional tunes after my deadline had passed and I had already sent my notes to the record company.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Were you given any “rules” by the Doctor or a frame in which to build upon or was it simply left to you?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
In true John Cale style, he left it up to me.
</div>


<div class="iview_q">
You mention about hopping on a bus to Wellingborough, it gives no indication on the re-issue or the original so from this I’m guessing the sessions were recorded at Beck?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
Justine was certainly done at Beck. I think the title track was done there too. Other places David used were Woodbine in Leamington and Mad Malcolm’s Recording Shack & Alsatian Farm (aka Ace Studios) in a village called Bugbrooke.
</div>


<div class="iview_q">
You have written many sleeve notes for various Jazz Butcher albums over the years, was this the first non-Jazz Butcher piece?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
A few years ago Joe Foster’s Rev-Ola label re-released Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. I had the honour to pen the notes on that one. I can’t think of any other occasions on which I’ve done it, but something might have slipped through the net somewhere…

	<div class="iview_intro">
	When writing about The Jazz Butcher (a.k.a. Pat Fish) I’m always tempted to lapse into the kind of adorational hyperbole and literary invention normally reserved for epic novels where a charismatic and mysterious character arrives out of nowhere and changes the course of events. But that’s what did happen, I tell you—suddenly when I was sixteen I was holding a copy of the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy’s Distressed Gentlefolk and life would never really be the same. The songs had a swing and a sway and they had heart and a sense of humor and they were literate and romantic and smart and cheeky and I could go on for hours about what they meant to me at that point (and still mean to me now), but I shall do my best to avoid that kind of gushing. Often when one is talking about someone else’s biography they’re really talking about their own and that’s the last thing I want to do. And because I wasn’t there and have no idea as to what the facts are about his adolescent beginnings, for the ancillary and decidedly expurgated biographical information, let’s go to the man himself. On his MySpace page, Pat Fish writes of his origins: “I come from the 20th Century. I was born in West London at the end of the fifties, and I swear that things really were in black and white back then. As a small boy with a love for Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, I remember seeing Doctor Who and the Beatles for the first time the same rainy Saturday afternoon in 1963. I remember getting into a terrible tangle trying to sing along with "Good Morning Tokyo", the deceptively simple-sounding theme tune to the 1964 Olympics. As I grew a little older I was exposed to the full impact of the Beatles, the Pink Floyd, the Avengers and the Prisoner. I was also introduced to the work of my softly-spoken, charming "Uncle" Terry. He turned out to be Terence Fisher, director of Hammer studio horror pictures. Listen, pal. I was a goth before you were a goth. Believe me...After a series of largely unsuitable educational entanglements I moved to Northampton NN1 and took a job working as a legal secretary. In 1983, thanks to the kindness and reckless A&R policies of Dave and Julia Barker at Glass Records, I issued my first album. Like a big idiot I called it "The Jazz Butcher in Bath of Bacon". For over 20 years now I have been saying "We don't play jazz and we don't eat meat". Over and over again like a flapping zombie. Well, you get what you deserve…”
	<p />
	And now here’s what I do know: Over the last three decades the Jazz Butcher has consistently put out some of the most intelligent, inventive, hilarious, moving and brilliant music ever recorded by any mortal. I know that might sound excessive, but this is a guy whose canon is worthy of this kind of lionization. How many albums, you ask? Ten-- and that doesn’t even count compilations or E.P.s or live albums (of which there are many). I suppose the next question would be where you should start—at the beginning with Bath Of Bacon, in the middle with Condition Blue or with the band’s last studio album Rotten Soul. Although when it comes to this sort of thing I’ve always been somewhat of a linear purist, I think with The Jazz Butcher, you can jump in anywhere, because while most bands start thin and tentative, The Jazz Butcher seems to have sprung fully formed, his obsessions intact, his observations fresh, his melodies inescapable. In other words, you’re always going to feel invited. (Although, I feel I must add that I think you should buy everything he’s ever done.) Musically you’ve got post punk and rock and roll and folk with dashes of dance and electronica and you might think of the Modern Lovers or the Velvet Underground or Spacemen 3 or the Television Personalities and that would probably be fine with Mr. Fish. Lyrically he’s wry and wise and but he can also be heartbreakingly sad. He can write a positively frenetic, altogether strange number (“Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present”) and in the next instant he can leave you devastated by the kind of wrenching ballad (“Angels”) that makes you realize you blew it with the girl and the night shall remain a place where she won’t be ever again.
	<p />
	Yes, it does happen that fast.
	<p />
	But to leave it at that description alone, falls short, embarrassingly short, and for a man whose oeuvre contains hundreds of songs—maybe even thousands—that summation fails to capture just what it is that he does. In the same way you wouldn’t describe Roger Federer as a guy who hits a decent tennis ball, or the universe as being kind of big, you can’t just call The Jazz Butcher a singer/songwriter from England. He’s an extraordinary, singular talent, who writes songs that last. And let’s talk about those songs: Kittens pop up (“Love Kittens”) pin-ups are conjured to make a metaphorical point (“Just Like Bettie Page”) slain Prime Ministers are toasted (“Olof Palme”) dead movie stars are brought back to life (“Peter Lorre”) songs are covered (“Roadrunner”, “Sweet Jane”) and hearts are blasted asunder under the watchful eye of a knowing ballad (“Cit Of Night”). But that doesn’t even scratch the surface, because we haven’t said anything about the zombies and big old winds and Hungarian love songs and ghosts and penguins and girls who keep goldfish and girls on drugs and girls that say yes and girls that go and never come back. It’s a whole universe of things that the Jazz Butcher sings about and for some strange reason that world hit me in a way that nothing has ever hit me before: not Stipe’s melodic mumblings about trains or Westerberg’s sublime lonely howl or Morrissey’s glorious gloom can touch the caretaker cabaret of The Jazz Butcher. The Jazz Butcher is an animist, an observational genius who knows that you can put into a pop song whatever you choose. Alongside his trusty guitarist (the marvelous Max Eider) and a revolving cast of musicians—some from Bauhaus, one from The Woodentops, a few from The Blue Aeroplanes, to name a few—The Butcher has a body of work that is worthy of being mentioned in the same hallowed halls as any great you choose.
	<p />
	This was supposed to be an introduction, not a coronation. So now we’re all embarrassed. Just trust me about The Jazz Butcher. It’s never too late to get on the bus.
	<p />
	It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway—we’re proud as hell to have him to The Carousel. Read on.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Caught In The Carousel: What I've always found so striking about the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy is on those early records the band's identity seemed so fully formed, the aesthetic almost instant. That's no small feat for such a young band--what was the key to that artistic self-possession?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Pat Fish: Well, we weren't that young, compared to a lot of people. I was already 24 when we started making the first record. Max Eider (guitar) and I had known each other for quite a few years. We had become disillusioned with pretty much the same things and taken refuge in a few--primarily 1960's--things that we both admired.
	<p />
	Musically, once Max adopted that loungey guitar style of his, it provided a definite, identifiable sonic hook, as it were. My ability on all the instruments was extremely rudimentary, so at least that compelled me to keep things simple. The first line-up was pretty gang-minded. I'd say that the NN1 end (David and me) tended to provide the theoretical end of the aesthetic, whereas the Londoners (Max and Owen) actually had the chops. And the Triumph Vitesse convertible. Important, too, to credit D. Elvis Barker of Glass Records for corralling such a pack of foppish shitheids and building some kind of a mythology around them. Not to say that he was Malcolm McClaren or anything, but he was very astute in feeding us new music and cultural references that he knew would push our buttons. Uh...we didn't really notice any of that at the time...
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	The Jazz Butcher seemed to be almost like a separate identity from Pat Fish--did you find a certain freedom in operating under a persona? I don't mean in an Alice Cooper kind of way, but did you intend for people not to confuse you with him?
	</div>



	<div class="iview_a">
	Very early on, I recorded rudimentary versions of the “Jazz Butcher Theme” and “Zombie Love” on a cassette player at home. I didn’t really want to get myself linked with a tune about having sex with dead people, so I decided to attribute this woeful behaviour to the Jazz Butcher character. Quite a lot like Alice Cooper, really, although I’d always imagined JB more as an enormous soul man type of guy. His theme tune totally lifts Wilson Pickett’s “Land Of A Thousand Dances,” for example, and “Sex Engine” is just a hideous, unfinished take on the Bar-Kays’ “Soul Finger”. The initial cassette was in a run of four. One went to my mate John Silver, with whom I had been in a band. One went to a man called ${terry}, who is a mad lunatic of my acquaintance. One went to Mike Alway, then at Cherry Red Records, because I thought it might make him laugh. The fourth went to D. Elvis Barker at Glass Records, because he was about the only person I knew who had a record label. Scarcely credibly, for the cassette was shit, Alway wrote back by hand, demanding more. Then Barker phoned up and asked if I wanted to do a single. I was more than astonished. When young ‘uns come and say, “Uncle Pat, you’ve had the odd record deal. How do we go about getting one?” I always have to tell them that I have no idea.
	<p />
	Even when we were recording the first album, I had no idea that anyone would ever really know the identity of the Jazz Butcher. I had always liked the idea of sniping away from the margins without anybody quite knowing where this shit was coming from. It was not to be, however. A combination of encouragement from D. Elvis Barker and our own youthful susceptibility to the possibility of free drink soon led Eider and me out into the Black Lion, if not the public eye. When the album came out with pictures of me on it, all was lost. Of course, these days I’ve just about got what I wanted. Sniping, unpaid, from the margins while people wonder where this shit is coming from. Ah, turned out all right in the end, then.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	One of the most distinguishing and endearing characteristics about the band was the interplay between you and Max. You would say, "Take a look at Max" and then Max would give us a look or "Everyone except Max--he's playing guitar"--and Max would follow that comment immediately with a solo. Talking about the guitarist before he plays seems rooted in the musical traditions of the blues or swing. Where did this penchant for announcing what was going to happen next in a song come from?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, it’s certainly right that in the early eighties I was listening to a lot of old jump jive type stuff. Slim Gaillard was, and remains, a favourite, and we often used to go and see Raymondo Gelato and his Chevalier Brothers. Also I was listening to a lot of old soul records, where that sort of thing happens quite a lot. The chief single impetus, however, came on the night that John Lennon was shot. Our friend The Antichrist (who now works—inevitably--in the world of advertising) had organised a wee cabaret evening. At one point he was singing his tune “Rough But Ready,” accompanied by Eider on guitar. As the instrumental break came up, he calmly drawled: “Take it, Max!”
	<p />
	This was a remarkable moment, not least because up until that very point, nobody had ever called the guitarist “Max”!
	</div>



	<div class="iview_q">
	The JBC's output between 1983 and 1986 is rather prolific--albums, singles, compilations, mini-albums, a live album, etc. You couldn't be stopped! Was this a sudden creative burst, or had you been writing songs for years that were able to find homes with the JBC?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I only started trying to write songs at the end of 1981. The first ones were “South America” and “Partytime.” Yes, quite an upward curve between Attempt # 1 and Attempt # 2, I agree. At the end of 1981 I moved briefly to a village in Northamptonshire. I didn’t know anybody there and I didn’t have any money, but I did have this old Amstrad twin deck cassette player where, thanks to a truly life-changing design oversight, you could make primitive and very hissy overdubs. You see, the internal microphones stayed open while you were copying a tape from one deck to the other. I’m sure it wasn’t meant to be like that, but it suited me just fine. As I taught myself to play guitar, I also taught myself how to make the most of primitive music skills by arranging simple shit together on tape. Using an electric bar fire as a drum kit (you get a great spring reverb on the “snare” from the heating elements inside), a nylon string guitar liberated from the Royal Navy, a tenor sax and a glockenspiel, I embarked on a period of learning/writing that provided the raw material for all of Bath and about 35% of Scandal. From the Summer of 1982 Max and I were playing the occasional gig. I was living in town by then, and working for a small town lawyer. I even had the beginnings of a social life, but still the home recording experiments would continue after work at my apartment in Birchfield Road.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	How long did this remain a part of your creative process?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I carried on using cassette recorders for home recording right up to and including the demos for Fishcotheque, recorded in 1987. In 1988 I took my money from the summer’s American tour and strode into the local music store to buy a Tascam Porta-One four-track. I paid cash. I didn’t get a discount. Those people no longer have that shop, he reported darkly. It’s fair to say that, once your band starts to go out and gig a lot, there isn’t so much opportunity to write. Me, I like to have vast periods of total inertia and tedium build up before I even start to think about writing. Not so easy when you’re on tour. On the other hand, you do get to see and hear some remarkable things and write them down in your notebook for further consideration at a later hour. Americans often like to compare me with Robyn Hitchcock. I like to tell them that Hitchcock has an imagination, whereas I simply pop over to their ludicrous country, take a few notes, stick a tune underneath and sell it back to them. Once the touring got underway, for a number of reasons I moved into my late grandfather’s flat on top of my parents’ house in a village. This at least meant that I would have long periods of peace and quiet in which to write between the madness. At the time I switched to Creation, I moved to where I live now, right in the middle of NN1. Because of the location I spend a lot of time acting as an unofficial drop-in centre, but I’ve still managed to write 6 JBC albums, one for Sumosonic and an album’s worth of material for my band Wilson over that time.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Do you write every day?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I certainly don’t try to write every day (I bet I should). I don’t even play guitar every day, though I usually do. I’m still writing these days, though I have no way of knowing whether any of it is any good.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	I've read that you weren't so pleased with Distressed Gentlefolk. I've claimed on more than one occasion that it's my favorite album of all time--from "Falling In Love" to “Angels," it always struck me as perfectly seamless. What was the mood of the band at that time?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	There is a big old divide about this album. You are in with Alan McGee and the Americans here, whereas ask any German and you will be told, “This is a very bed elbum.” To be honest, it puts me out a bit when Germans say things like that. For one thing, they’re normally so nice to me. For another, I don’t think it’s diabolical, but it’s fair to say that I do have…uh…issues with it. Since we had recorded Sex & Travel with him, John A. Rivers had moved with the spirit of the age and enthusiastically embraced The Digital. The reverb was digital (courtesy of Lexicon) and the tape was--shockingly to my youthful and bleary eyes--Betamax. Yes, John recorded the album on Betamax. Not, perhaps, exactly at one with the grimy punk rock adventures that we had been enjoying on or near the Red Bus since last we recorded with him. Frankly, our own Doherty-like delusions aside, I do think that John went more than a little overboard with the ‘verb. That snare drum on “Angels”; Jonesy hits it, the Lexicon kicks in…you’ve got time to put the kettle on, pop to the shop up the road for sugar and fags, come back, make a lovely cup of tea, open your fags, light one up…that fecking snare reverb is still going!
	<p />
	I had, frankly, squandered a couple of potentially good songs already with the Conspiracy EP. Max and I had been dispatched to the countryside to make demos for Distressed Gentlefolk. It’s true that we got “Angels” down in prototype, but we also got completely carried away and put out our lo-fi rantings as an EP. Hey, it sold really well and there were only two of us splitting the money! That, however, meant that a lot of tunes that could have gone on the album didn’t; and I think that there are a few moments on the album where it really does betray a shortage of quality material. In addition, there were certain really ambitious ideas that simply weren’t coming off in the studio. “Hungarian Love Song” should probably have been a b-side. “Buffalo Shame” fell over on its enormous, shaggy rump. “Nothing Special,” intended as an essay in straight-ahead vodka-blinded misanthropy and rage, ends up with an intro that sounds like Elvis Costello’s godawful “Oliver’s Army.” What’s that all about? The mood of the band was funny. We were feeling quite ambitious about the record, but I think ultimately that only encouraged John Rivers to overdo the proggy aspect of things. The record should have been warmer and more rocking. Max was probably the most enthusiastic at the time. Owen and I were on a fitness kick that resulted in his hurting his stomach and my driving a rowing boat into the bank of the boating pond. Graham (bass guitar) was effectively missing in action. He struggled a bit to keep up with the pace of recording, so I ended up dubbing some of the bass on myself. We had all been touring frantically for about 18 months, recording in the breaks. Max, Owen (drums) and I were tired but we were buzzing. I think poor old Graham was just tired. We all enjoyed ourselves over the session, but almost as soon as I got the tape home I thought that something was wrong here. I just think the record sounds a bit tired and drained and I don’t think the “bleached” digital clarity helps with that. I think there could have been some better songs on it. I think somebody should have kicked my arse about that, really. But we were cocky. Halfway through the recording session, D. Elvis Barker told us that we would be going on tour to America. Graham wanted to know if he could rent a motorcycle and follow the tour bus around. It was at this exact point that I realised that we had already lost him to a parallel universe.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	And what of the song “South America?”
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	“South America” was a deliberate insult to CD buyers; an extra track that was extra crap. Well, these were the days when “CD” meant Brothers in Arms to the likes of me. We knew people needed an extra track or two because they were paying more, but we still hated the idea of a CD as somehow being “better” than a record. History has, of course, proved that a CD is not better than a record. So I may be poor and derided and have no teeth, but Ha! Ha! Ha! regardless.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Was the progression from Distressed Gentlefolk to Fishcotheque a tough one, with the departure of Eider?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Not really, no. Kizzy was already around. He lived with Max and Owen, he came on tour as a guitar tech and he knew how to play the stuff. After all, Max was there to show him it. After Max’s departure, it seemed completely logical for Kiz to step in as guitarist. It took a while to find a suitable rhythm section, but that wasn’t a problem on the record, as we had Dave and Dave from the Weather Prophets to take care of that for us. I was thrilled to bits about that, by the way. I had had a good year to write new stuff, and I was feeling quite free to write whatever I wanted. Having Alan McGee and Creation behind me did a lot for my confidence, too.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> In terms of your songwriting, you seem to have mastered the difficult balance between happiness and melancholy—or even tragedy and comedy. For example, on Distressed Gentlefolk, "Angels" positively aches, while "Domestic Animal" is seemingly rather lighthearted. Has this ever presented a difficulty when sequencing an album?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> There is a term within the JBC: “Art Misery Ballad.” You do rather have to keep them apart. At the start of this century the JBC (Eider, Jones, Valentine, me) would play a set that would often include Max’s “Diamorphine” and my “Sister Death.” These became known as “The Twin Towers of Misery and Despair.” We felt obliged to keep them away from each other for the sake of the poor, long-suffering punter. Odd that you should pick on “Domestic Animal” as lighthearted; it just goes to show to what extent that album failed to convey its intended effects. “Domestic Animal” is supposed to be well disassociated--flapping tragic really. I know how those squeaky crocodiles might make people think otherwise, though. I guess it’s just me that finds the cry of a little, squeaky plastic crocodile absolutely fucking heartbreaking. Still, album sequencing can be a shitter. I was never really crazy about following “Daycare Nation” with “My Zeppelin” on Cult Of the Basement. Mind you, everything gotta be somewhere. We did have a mental time sequencing that one. We had a huge map of all the little pieces of music on the wall. At the top it read: “Smile.”
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> How did the revolving cast of alums who were in the JBC inform the sound of the band--was it always like starting over when someone new came to the fold?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Nearly everybody who has played in or with the band has brought an enormous amount to the party. Even conversation on the bus or in the pub can lead to all sorts of ideas. It’s not really the culture of the JBC for people just to play their instrument and go home to the wife and kids. People tend to get involved in all sorts of ways. Of course, occasionally you get one who doesn’t quite fit. I already mentioned Graham: as Owen said to me one day, “He’s been in the band for a year now and I feel like I know him less well than when first we met.” Of course, Graham didn’t stay in the band for long after that. But there have only been one or two people like that and I won’t name and shame.
	<p />
	Perhaps, though, it’s fair to give a big-up to the most influential ones: Max, self-evidently; Rolo, an inspiration at the very start; David J. for showing us all how to do it; Paul Mulreany, so much more than just “the drummer”; Richard Formby, sonic magician and a pool of light and calm and beauty on an ugly bus; Gabriel “The Bishop” Turner, another guitar-playing drummer and power-crazed programming pioneer. The guest contributions of Alex Lee and Kevin Haskins have both been crucial to certain records, and they are two of the loveliest men you could hope to meet. I think it’s fair to say that it does feel a little bit like “starting over” sometimes, mostly if you have a change of drummer, because a drummer is so central and important to a band. Until the drummer’s locked in, you’re not really going anywhere. But it’s always been a pleasure. It’s unbelievably obvious, but so many people fail to remember it: why work with people you don’t like?

	<div class="iview_q"> Big Planet Scarey Planet and Cult of the Basement were marvelous, but nothing could prepare me for the emotional devastation of Condition Blue. How does that one hold up for you? It seems intensely personal—
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I like the record a lot. The initial sessions saw Paul Mulreany, Joe Allen, Alex Lee and me putting down the backing tracks live. We had it set up so that we could all play in the room together. I had just had my head kicked in by a very large gentleman in the West End the night before and my face was covered in cuts and bruises. Joe, the bassist, I had never met before, so he sure got an interesting first impression. We all knew the songs a little bit from home recordings I had sent around, with helpful notes like: “’Girls Say Yes’--This is TOTAL CORNFLAKES.” So the four of us pretty much just sat down in this little room and played and played and played. All the backing tracks for the record were done in 3 or 4 days, a lot of the versions are first takes. We figured at the time that the lengthy bouts of one-chord jamming at the end of a lot of the numbers would be edited or faded when it came time to mix. So we rather indulged ourselves. It was absolutely magic. Mulreany was on the form of his lifetime, and Lix and Joe were just as good. Many years later, Joe (I think it was Joe) said to me of that session. “Yes, four desperate men in one room, each so desperate that he completely failed to notice the state of the others.” So we played and played and played, and in the long run it almost certainly helped us to feel less desperate. That is one thing that I like about the record.
	<p />
	I also like the fact that, along with Cult of the Basement, it will shortly be appearing on I-Tunes, where it can make money for me. Plug.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Tell us about “Shirley MacLaine”—
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> “Shirley MacLaine” features a live guitar duel between Alex Lee and Richard Formby. I was there when it took place; as good as seeing the VU at that psychiatrists’ convention. Lix was standing on the producer’s chair, one of those big modern things with wheels on. He wanted the engineer to hurry up and run the tape because he’d just done about half a pint of amyl nitrate. Richard was leaning up against the fireplace, smoking something that looked like it should belong to Bob Marley. The tape rolled. Fucking mayhem! I really liked that studio, Raven. Out in the middle of nowhere (Jonny Mattock infamously used to play drums for the Perfect Disaster on the lawn, and I myself was forced to perform the vocal for “Girl Go” on the same lawn at two in the morning in January and it was bloody cold and that way they finally got me to sing the thing properly, in one take, funnily enough. Did I mention they had taken my shirt away?).
	<p />
	This was also the first JBC album where I was the only thing in the building that approximated to a “producer”. At long last I had complete, hands-on control of the entire mixing operation. And when that day dawned, when there were truly no more overdubs with which to procrastinate, when the engineer was re-routing the desk and breaking out the reels of tape, I was flapping terrified. I spent an hour or so playing chicken with the traffic on the main road on one of the studio bikes and when, by about four o’clock, I had, despite my best efforts, failed to be crushed by a speeding potato lorry, I figured I might as well give things a go. At which point I must offer special credit to the studio engineer, Tim Burrell, who had fully grasped my state of mind and, being the big Julian Cope fan that he is, played the role of Donald Ross Skinner even better than the desperate situation demanded. While allowing me to believe at all times that I was in full, Phil Spector control, he very quietly steered the recordings towards some kind of coherence and professionalism. It was beyond a pleasure working with Tim on those mixes, it really was. In the end, of course, we left the jammy bits on at the ends of the tunes. We just had so much fun playing them that we figured that would come through on the record. Also, we felt that we had really caught the nature of how we sounded live, something which previous album productions had pretty spectacularly failed to do. So I like that, and I thought it was worth making the most of it. This had the side effect of really pissing off the dumber portions of our North American following, the ones who would shout for “The Devil is my Friend” all the way through “Susie” or something, so I like that aspect of it, too. You know, some people reckon it’s their band and you just play in it. I really felt that the whole Condition Blue episode served to remind people that we did have the right to make the music we wanted.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> How has it aged since its release?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Looking back, I think it holds up pretty well. The music seems kind of “timeless” (despite Mulreany’s best efforts!) and I’m a bit taken aback at some of the lyrics now. I didn’t notice at the time how bitter I was coming across. There are a couple of quite cheap shots in there, which might have benefited from a little judicious editing. But it is what it is and I can still enjoy listening to it. Over the years, a lot of the initial hostility to Condition Blue has waned. I get a few people writing in and saying that they “get it” now. I think perhaps that I ought to feel sorry for these people. I mean, what has happened to them that they now “get it”?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Didn’t a lot of pain go into the writing of that album?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Yes, a lot of pain went into writing it, but, as I’m sure you see, a lot of pleasure came out of making it. And for a moment back there, I actually knew how it felt to be Dave Stewart of the Eurhythmics. You can’t really say fairer than that, can you?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> I remember back in '88 you told me that one should never meet their heroes because they'd certainly have it in for them. That being said, playing alongside people you admire like Jonathan Richman or R.E.M. must have been intimidating—
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Yes, Jonathan Richman is a little intimidating. He is expert in the martial arts, for a start. Given the way that he comes across as so childlike in his work, I think that he has, over the years, met one or two promoters who have thought him fair game for a bit if a scam, and more than a few journalists who have patronised the arse off him. And it’s fair to say that in real life Mister Richman does not suffer this kind of thing without standing up for himself. In 1984 he had famously terrorised a room full of indie music journalists at a London press conference. We met him in 1985 and we showed him plenty of respect. This wasn’t unnatural, because we really liked him. In return he gave us things.
	<p />
	It began with the beer. His dressing room was next door to ours, and in he came with a case of Holsten in which he, of course, had no interest. We did. We offered him things, but he didn’t really want anything. Later he came and gave us a load of food that he didn’t want. Then he brought us something else. It went on and on and we warmed to him a great deal. This, remember, was 1985, at the height of Ronald Reagan’s voodoo economics, and here it was: the trickle-down effect in full…well, effect. As pasty-faced callow would-be socialists we were confused at our delight. After his performance Jonathan was given a huge sticky chocolate cake by a girl fan who had obviously been thinking hard about what she could give Jonathan that he might actually want. As soon as the dear girl was out the door, Jonathan was back in our dressing room, donating the cake! He is intimidating, but he is a gentleman and, frankly, good to be around.
	<p />
	By chance--and a spectacularly good bit of booking by someone at Warwick University--we met R.E.M. the very same evening. We came off after our set, which had been rocking, and as soon as we were off the stage we were buttonholed by two young American guys. I was chatting with them about how bloody brilliant the JBC were and wondering why the little skinhead one looked so familiar. At some point my mind dubbed a mop of hair on top of his head and it began to dawn on me; “Are you…uh…is your name Michael?” Yes, the other one was Bucky. To be honest, they weren’t really heroes to us at the time. We were aware of them as being an up-and-coming U.S. band. My flatmate had one of their singles. They really were only just on our radar, but they took to us in quite a big way. Michael Stipe went on MTV and said that we were his favourite U.K. band, which must have helped us sell some tickets here and there. They sent us each a copy of their record. To be honest, I think we flogged them for beer money. I’ve run into Peter Buck a few times over the years (often there’s a Robyn Hitchcock connection) and he has always struck me as a really sincere, down-to-earth geezer. If you like beer and guitars, he’s yer pal, and I find that very refreshing. He certainly doesn’t strike me as the kind of guy who would mind me flogging one of his albums for beer money. I once said to Peter Buck: “You’ve got the easiest job in the world, you.” He did not argue. In 1993 I was asked to open for John Cale at the Forum. Now, that was scary. But I shook him by the hand and got away quick. He seemed really big, which is odd, because most pop stars look really small in the flesh, I find, especially Siouxsie and the Banshees. They’re tiny. Cale filled the little backstage corridor, I swear. I saw him onstage in Northampton just a couple of months ago. He’s really not that big. Spooky! He was incidentally, blinding: the best I’ve ever seen him.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> You mentioned the Germans earlier--they adored you early on in your career; hence, the Hamburg live album. Was it hard to predict how certain countries would take to you? I saw you in S.F. four times and the affection my fellow Bay Area-ites had for you was obvious!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> We were constantly astonished that anybody took us remotely seriously or liked what we were doing. I remember being woken up by a phone call telling me that we were going to play in Spain and thinking “In the Devil’s name, why?” Here’s an astonishing thing that we discovered: you cannot go wrong by taking the national folk music of a nation and subjecting it to cheap, cruel and unyielding parody. Our first inkling of this came in April 1985 in a place called Linz in Austria. The club where we were playing had printed in its programme a review of A Scandal in Bohemia. Of “My Desert” the reviewer wrote: “it’s like an Alpine hunting song and it gives you goose-bumps.” This caused amusement among us, but the song wasn’t in our live set at the time, so the full impact of this was yet to be felt. In February 1986 we were in the dressing room before the first show of our first French tour. We had done one particularly successful festival appearance the previous December and the French press reckoned we were kinda hot, so in this provincial university hall there were about 500 French kids ready and waiting to see what all the fuss was about. At which point some joker went “Let’s play ‘La Mer’!”
	<p />
	Not wishing to shuffle off this mortal coil in a hail of coins in an obscure part of Normandy, I give it the full Dubya and veto this insane suggestion. The show goes well, however, and as the French People shout for an encore, the question of “La Mer” is raised again. We do know how to play the song, so for a laugh we go out and do it. The place goes fucking Edgar Wallace Donuts.
	<p />
	In February 1987 Alex Green and I are on stage at the Little Rex club in Paris. In scenes reminiscent of the Jonathan Richman live album with its umpteen reprises of “Ice Cream Man,” we are called back to the stage to perform “La Mer” something like five times in a row. In 1988 a French band called The Little Rabbits records a cover of “La Mer” and has a sort of indie hit with it. Then other French bands cover it. The stupid wee song is still earning me about two to three hundred pounds a year, 25 years after it was first recorded. Then, of course, there is the question of “The Devil is my Friend.” It was recorded as an extra bonus track on the b-side of a twelve inch single. When Dave Barker came up to the studio and heard that we had recorded it, he went “Well, that’s stupid.” We were unable to deny this at the time.
	<p />
	Then we went across the Atlantic. Everywhere we went people would holler for the shit country song. People even played the stupid bloody thing on the radio. In 1988 the JBC come back onstage for a bit of an encore at Barriemore’s Theatre in Ottawa. Tragically, we are all wearing matching tee shirts with the Jazz Porker on them (the reason for this escapes me now). We stand, helpless, our instruments just hanging there, while eight hundred lusty Canadian voices chant endlessly: “THE DEVIL IS MY FRIEND! THE DEVIL IS MY FRIEND! THE DEVIL IS MY FRIEND! THE DEVIL IS MY FRIEND!”
	<p />
	It was actually scary. I just thought how funny it would be if some right-wing Christian type had happened to wander in and see what was going on in there. Honestly, it was like Iron Maiden and all the Hammer movies you’ve ever seen all mixed up in this big old Victorian theatre with these four pasty idiots just standing there under the lights on the stage in these stupid fucking tee shirts, surely the campest, most inappropriate Satanic cult leaders of all time. It was mind-blowing. So there you go. Nobody ever went broke taking the piss out of the host nation’s music. Who knew?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> How have you managed to maintain friendships in this business?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, when you’re constantly traveling around and not getting enough sleep because you’re staying up all night in noisy clubs gorging yourself on free drink and drugs with interesting women, you can get a little irritable. People are more tired than they think they are and sometimes things do get nasty. But for the most part it’s nothing worse than you’d see in a football team dressing room. There are a number of ways of dealing with this stuff. None of them were known to the first generation of the JBC, because we had just wandered into this life without any idea of what was going to happen to us. I think we did pretty well to go two years of endless touring before we exploded. In 1997 Max said to me that back in the day he had had no idea of how much stuff I was doing for the band off the stage. It was only when he had to promote his own album that he began to realise that an interview schedule was not actually an ego massage but an unrelenting programme of answering the same stupid questions from provincial journalists who wouldn’t actually know you if you sat in their laps and fed them candied almonds.
	<p />
	But back in the day, of course, all he could see was me swanning off in a car with some bird from the record company. The second line-up was specifically assembled as a band. We didn’t know each other that well, at first. After about 3 weeks on the road in the UK (with the ‘Minks) and in France, we sat down one night in a hotel room and we came up with the Rennes Accord. Effectively, this laid out all sorts of useful rules about what did and what didn’t constitute acceptable behaviour and what appalling sanctions should befall transgressors. For the remainder of the tour, this code was ruthlessly enforced, chiefly by current NME Roadie of The Year, Steve Molloy (known these days simply as Fatty). His brutal regime of headslaps and suchlike caused Mulreany to speculate one afternoon: “The bus, man. It’s like Romford on wheels…no, no it’s not…it’s like PRISON!” We were all delighted. “Hi dad! I’m in jail! I LIKE IT HERE!” At the end of that tour I was describing some of the more colourful outbreaks of carnage to my pal Sonic Boom. His verdict? “It sounds like hell.” “Naaaaah,” I replied, “It was brilliant.”
	<p />
	Most people who have ever done this for any length of time do realize, sooner or later, that what happens when band members fall out is not so important. Everyone understands that people on tour are not at their most rational. To be honest, I prefer someone who just goes all-out mental now and again to some of the other coping strategies which some people adopt. And, as Alan McGee so rightly wrote: “Any time one of my whining pop stars phones me up from tour to complain about how dreadful it all is, I ask them if they’d prefer to be working down a mine.” I haven’t stayed friends with everybody. Only the ones I like. But that is most of them.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> What is your proudest professional moment?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Tempting just to put “too many to relate,” but I suppose that would be to disrespect your grammar. After all, there can be only one.
	<p />
	Off the top of my head…in third place: Summer of 1986, first trip to the U.S.A.: singing “Sweet Jane” in the Cat Club, New York, knowing that Lou Reed was playing literally a couple of blocks away at the same time. The runner-up: Playing the Italian Young Communists Festival 1986 to about 30,000 people in the big old square overlooking the Bay of Naples, and playing it well. As we went on stage, our agent Mario said, “One good word for Gorbachev, one good word for Maradona.” I followed his advice to the letter.
	<p />
	But today’s favourite: In the Summer of 1989 Pete Astor and I decided to do a brief German tour, performing solo sets and going by train. We tooled ourselves up with rail passes and a timetable, arranged with the venues to have amps waiting for us on arrival and climbed aboard the train with our bags and our Telecasters. Of course, on arrival at the first show we were met by the German tour manager that our agent had laid on to take care of us. He had his Mercedes, all ready to transport us around the country in style, but we, of course, had our rail tickets. For three or four days he dutifully loaded the Telecasters into the back of his car and drove them to the next venue while Pete and I whiled away the trip in the dining car of an excellent German train. Occasionally we would admit to some embarrassment about the situation, with this poor man driving alone around the nation with nothing for company except two guitars in the boot. In due course we made it to Hamburg on the hottest day of the year. We did radio and wandered down to the venue. As I came in I found our tour manager in conversation with a man who turned out to be his boss, the man from the agency. I know a bit of German and it became clear to me that the tour manager was explaining to his boss that we never actually traveled with him and that he felt a bit surplus to requirements. The boss was coming across a bit uncertain about this and was effectively asking, “Are you really sure about these guys? Will they really be able to cope without you?” Our tour manager replied “Ja. Sie sind echte Profis.” “They’re real pros.” Damn, was I happy about that. Still makes me smile now.
	<p />
	Footnote: The tour manager was duly taken off the Astor/Fish Railroad Revue. Practically the next night, in Dortmund, we were kidnapped on the orders of some girls from the record company, and taken in the middle of the night to a bizarre Alpine style cottage in a village in the middle of nowhere. We did, however, manage to disentangle ourselves and flee back to the hotel by the station where we were supposed to be in the first place. But it does just go to show…
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> How did Waiting For The Love Bus and Illuminate differ from previous JBC albums?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> It was never going to be easy to follow Condition Blue. The decision to record at Richard Formby’s studio in Leeds was made for two reasons: first, I wanted to keep the same kind of production control that I had had on Condition Blue, and obviously working with Richard was one guaranteed way to achieve this; second, because Richard’s studio at the time was only 16-track, it was about half the price of our usual 24-track facilities, which meant that we could take twice as long on the record for the same amount of money. Plus, of course, it’s an absolute pleasure to work with Richard in his big, airy studio that looks out over the centre of Leeds. As the recordings went on, it emerged that this record would be a little bit “beyond”; still sounding like the JBC, but sort of bleached out and distant. Lyrically, “Ghosts” was the key tune. The taxman had just found me after several years and invisibility really had its attractions at the time. Musically, it’s “Rosemary Davis’ World of Sound” that really gives the keynote to the record. That said, things like “Bakersfield” and “President Chang” could be really, really fierce on stage.
	<p />
	Illuminate was recorded in Northampton, hence all that stuff about Abington Square on the sleeve notes. The studio is a proper 24-track job, but they gave us a good rate, so we had plenty of time and the convenience of being able to walk to work from my house.
	<p />
	The generation of the basic touring band which made Illuminate was quite radically different from what had gone before, with Gabriel “The Bishop” Turner on the drums and Northampton-based lead guitarist Dave Henderson. On the other hand, Dooj on the bass was a veteran of the band since 1991 and had played on Love Bus, and we roped in the Alexes (Green and Lee) to add a bit of the old conceptual continuity. Of course, the biggest dollop of conceptual continuity on this record was having Dave J. around to mix it. Having moved to America, Dave was temporarily back in Northampton, trying to sell his house. He threw himself back into the local scene with a vengeance, which included mixing this LP. Dave wasn’t around for the actual recordings, so I took the MD role there, then took very much of a back seat for the mixing, leaving Dave to do his magic.
	<p />
	When he played me the mix of “Scarlett,” he told me that he had left the guide vocal completely “flat” and un-effected. The sweetheart! There is one other respect in which these records differ from previous output: thanks to Sony taking control of Creation’s foreign affairs, we were marginalised in the very territories where we were normally (in our own, limited way) successful. I remember a woman phoning from Sony in Canada, telling me that Love Bus was selling ever so well there. The figure that she gave me was something like one percent of what we would normally have sold in that territory on our old deal with Polygram there.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> What was it like to come together again and record Rotten Soul?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> As Max says in his sleeve notes, the record was made “on the cheap,” with a budget that represented about 10% of what we spent on Basement or Condition Blue. That’s why we decided to record the thing at Peter Crouch’s house. He’d been making some lovely demo recordings on a digital 16-track machine, and we figured that we would be able to do the same. The sessions were lots of fun. There were no egos or arguments, but we had an awful lot of trouble with the equipment. The computer really didn’t want to sync up with the digital recorder. Despite our best efforts, you can still hear moments like the breakdown on “Call Me” where everything goes flappy. We also had seven shades of trouble trying to EQ the mixes, as the digital recorder would only show you a display for one track at a time. To a man used to sprawling all over a big desk, tweaking the EQ of several different tracks sympathetically, this represented a giant nuisance. There would be no help from Crouchy on the mixing either, for he had already gone back to his day job at British Airways, so I just had to muddle through with a piece of equipment that I hardly knew or understood. Just to complete the tale of sonic woe, we were all on tour in the U.S.A. when the thing was mastered, so we had no chance to tweak things there either. Still, there’s a couple of decent songs on there, a couple of decent performances and even one or two more-or-less successful mixes. Not bad for a record made in somebody’s house by a pack of drunks. On the other hand, the finished record was hardly the hammer-blow of bitter self-justification that we had been aiming for.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> As a career, rock and roll lacks a pension and job security—did this ever worry you?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> “Health Insurance”–what a fatuous concept! I was born and raised in the Welfare State, thank you very much, where health provision is legally defined as being free of charge at the point of use, dependent upon the patient’s need, rather than his or her ability to pay. “Health Insurance”: what a fecking nightmarish phrase! “Blackmail” might be a shorter, pithier way of putting it. When I signed up with Creation, Alan McGee actually gave me my “pension”: Creation had pressed 24 copies of the Mary Chain’s first single, “Upside Down” on twelve-inch. Only the seven-inch was ever released. I can remember Alan handing me a white label of the twelve-inch at about two o’clock in the morning, saying, “There you go, Pat. There’s your pension.” In 1991 I sold my pension to buy a train ticket to London. The hippie in the shop gave me £40:00 for it. It is a constant worry that there is no security in this game when you get old. But this is not a game for pussies. If you want a pension and shit, go and sit in an office for eight hours a day for the rest of your able-bodied life. Even then, you can’t be sure that your boss will not have siphoned off all the pension funds long before you retire. All you can really do is try to write shit that will last. That’s your only hope of a pension, really. On the other hand, if you like doing this stuff, why not just keep doing it? They try to make you “retire” all the time in this game. All you can do is keep on keeping on.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> What is the current state of the JBC back catalog? Will it all be available on ITUNES? I know that people spend massive amounts on out of print JBC albums--will those ever get back into circulation?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I believe that the Glass stuff (the first 4 albums) is now available on I-Tunes. I think that Cherry Red are behind it. I’m putting up Cult of the Basement and Condition Blue (via Setanta Records) very soon. Since there was never any paper contract between me and Creation (Yes! The last punk rock record deal!), and since the records have long since been in profit, Sony have no claim on these records, so I’m free to do the deal. Hey, Sony probably aren’t even aware that the records exist. I think the era of people paying $100=00 for Bath of Bacon on E-Bay has gone now. Vinyl Japan re-released a lot of the Glass stuff in 2001, and now you can download a lot of the stuff, so I think that the inflation in the second-hand JBC market has abated fairly radically in the last few years. It was getting really silly there for a moment, though. Instead of the fans making the band rich, it ended up with the band making the fans rich as they sold off their old vinyl for mad prices. You see, we never really understood this business…
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> There's a lot of recurring iconography in your songs--animals, drinking, vampires; I remember in grad school the poet Greg Orr telling me that he thought the person who knows what interests them is the luckiest person around. I know this is bordering on asking you to psychoanalyze yourself, but do you have any idea why you choose the subjects you do when you write? How do they help tell the story?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, animals, drinking and vampires all played a major part in my upbringing.
	I’ve always really liked animals, and in 1985 I finally made the connection that if you like somebody, you really shouldn’t ought to herd them into death camps and eat the remains. My good friend Turkish George is a vegan and he reckons that as long as people continue to go around consuming the blood of traumatised beasts, belligerent and pointless conflict will be unending. He can wax very lyrical on this theme, most memorably one night when a bunch of the NN1 beat elite were there, high as you like, to hear his beautiful, rich voice intoning this message of doom while, in the background, a lengthy, brooding instrumental passage on a latter-day, crack-raddled Temptations album ground on, providing the perfect backing track. A couple of days later we recorded George reading out various bits of Moroccan poetry, Burroughs one-liners and Lee Perry rants. Then we dubbed them onto some Wilson backing tracks, which led, eventually to “Istanbul Connection,” which you can enjoy--and, indeed, download for free--at www.myspace.com/wilsondub.
	<p />
	The JBC certainly did seem to attract a lot of attention for doing drinking songs. When first I met Robyn Hitchcock, in his dressing room at a Northampton venue in 1987, he said to me, quite out of the blue: “All your songs are about going down the pub, aren’t they?” Cheeky wastrel. I had been listening a great deal to his I Often Dream of Trains album, which apparently he recorded at a time when he had been seriously ill. It’s pretty clear from the record that he had mortality on his mind, and at times he seems to rail against the entire organic structure of the universe. So, rather than thump him, which would have been a bit rude, seeing as he was a visitor to Northampton and all, I did my best by suggesting to him that all his bleeding tunes seemed to be about the state of his insides. Happy days, indeed! Considering that he really had been at death’s door, with a condition that had nothing whatsoever to do with drink or drugs and everything to do with some bizarre tropical parasite (well, it would be, wouldn’t it?), I thought he took it all very well. But you see what I mean? We write about girls and politics and animals and drugs and monsters and all that rock n’ roll shit, and all that anyone notices--even an eagle-eyed pop detective like Mr. Hitchcock--is that we write songs about going down the pub.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> And you certainly aren’t the only ones…
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> It might have escaped the attention of the 500 tousle-haired, corduroy-trousered indie chin-strokers making the scene back in the day, but songs about drinking had actually been around before we started singing them in 1983; since the dawn of civilisation, to be exact. Drinking was a huge element in our lives at the time. You may have noticed that musicians tend to play in bars; or theatres with bars; or college halls with bars. Musicians work in bars. When they are not at work they hang out in bars. They do this because, seeing as they are in Barcelona, they can’t just go home and make a sandwich.
	<p />
	Everybody has to be somewhere, and musicians, more often than not, are in a bar. Bars sell drink. It is incredible, to my mind, that there are not millions of drinking songs being released every year. I suspect that it is a sinister, Lutheran influence on mainstream attitudes that is behind this bizarre situation in which people drink all the time and yet do not sing about it. Hold on for a massive digression as I try to illustrate what I mean:
	<p />
	In 1990 I watched an episode of “Family Feud” on T.V. in Seattle. It was interesting, because the “families” were, in fact, teams from the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. You know the score with this: they survey a bunch of punters about a number of questions, then the contestants have to guess the answers that polled best among the punters. Both teams were, unsurprisingly, significantly smarter than the average “real” family and I was really enjoying sitting in my little motel room, getting high in the afternoon, as I watched the smiling, intelligent face of the United States armed forces at play. There was this one question, however, that was causing the teams all kinds of problems: “Where would you be most ashamed to be seen?” They soon nailed the Number One answer: “On the toilet.” One by one they worked out nearly all the other answers, but the Number Two answer eluded the teams completely. Eventually the host was obliged to reveal the Number Two answer, and my jaw fell open, as did the jaws of all those nice servicemen and women on the show. Because the Number Two answer was: “In a bar.” At once you see the gulf (no pun intended) between men and women who routinely train, travel and solve problems, by force if necessary, and people for whom excitement is attending free game-show screenings in air-conditioned studios in the afternoon, and danger both moral and medical lurks menacingly in every branch of Starbuck’s.
	<p />
	Oddly enough, Martin Luther himself came from Germany, a country where even in these sad, cowed times, grown men and women drink openly on the street in broad daylight and nobody pays any attention; a country where beer and hard liquor are available in any gas station along the Autobahn and on the platform of almost any railway or U-Bahn station; a country where the concept of “closing time” is understood in a deeply subjective way; my kind of country! The Germans do not fear themselves when they drink, and thus, when they drink, they are nothing to fear. They have loads of songs about drinking. I have seen hundreds of happy Germans, pished out of their minds, sitting on great long benches with umpteen pints of beer, singing their heads off and leaping up and down off the bench with the music, loud as you like and completely off their handsome faces. Men, women, young, old, rich, poor, complete strangers, all singing together and making a terminal row. Then at one o’clock in the morning, when the bar shut down, they all quietly got up and went on their way. Not a glass smashed, not a single shouty confrontation.

	Some British people might start making cracks about “order” round about now, but I don’t see this as some creepy tendency to “order.” I see it as civilised. Drinking and getting high are part of life and to deny or repress that part of life leads to an unnatural situation, where ordinary everyday pleasure is regarded with something that seems akin to self-loathing. There certainly seems to be more than an element of self-loathing behind the Scandinavian model of drink control, so clearly attractive to the Alpha Course clowns who currently infest our political class in the U.K. I personally believe that this model leads to worse behaviour than the German model. I believe this because with my own eyes I have seen the Germans on the lash, as described above, and I have also seen a hairy Swedish man standing knee deep in snow in a car park at two in the morning, kicking a bicycle to death with no thought for the state of his foot come the dawn. I have stepped over the Scandinavian drink-tourists prone upon the streets of Lubeck, and been harassed by vodka-crazed Norwegian teenagers on a train from Denmark to Germany. As soon as they are freed from their native state alcohol repression where piss-poor lager costs a tenner a pint, and land in Germany with its sensible drink prices, these Scandinavian people go drink mental. Of course, they have nothing like the necessary experience to handle a massive binge like that, so they stumble and fall, they puke and they mewl, and I know this for I have seen it. No doubt the experience actually re-enforces their misguided view that drinking makes people go bad. (“Some people say alcohol makes you less lucid/And I think that’s true, if you’re kinda stupid.”--Lou Reed.)
	<p />
	It’s very similar with Brits abroad, of course. While not as repressive as in Scandinavia, U.K. liquor prices are still dramatically higher than in the rest of Europe. So inevitably some people are going to make pigs of themselves.
	<p />
	To my mind, to blame the low prices and long drinking hours in Europe is to miss the point completely. In countries like Spain, Germany, Italy and France, people are brought up around drinking. There is no shame in it. Yes, people will occasionally get drunk and out of order, but they won’t wallow in unconsummated shame, blaming the stuff in the bottle. They will acknowledge, sensibly enough, that they behaved stupidly with something that is, actually, a poison. If the Scandinavian/U.K./U.S. model inculcates the idea that there is no pleasure to be had from drinking, then it must acknowledge that people will end up in a state of mind where they do not derive any pleasure from drinking. So these people don’t understand how to derive pleasure from enjoying a drink. In fact, in the U.K. at least, many of them will simply drink whichever piss-poor chemically-brewed fake pilsner has shown the best adverts on TV early that evening. The trouble is, of course, that they still get drunk. In fact, if you train people to deny the pleasure in drinking, then you end up with people who believe that the only purpose of drinking is to get drunk. “Hurry up, Harry, get another round in before this place closes.” “Come on Lars, let’s spend the weekend on the ferry to Germany, throwing up.” Then your repressive licensing hours regime means that everybody spills out, drunk and dissatisfied, onto the street at exactly the same time. You really couldn’t organise it better than that if you were planning a cull of young, working-class males, could you?
	<p />
	Of course, since the licensing laws in the U.K. have been relaxed, levels of street violence have fallen significantly. Well, of course they have. There were certainly a lot of people in public positions in Northampton who railed against the licensing extension, prophesying that it would send crime skyrocketing. Now that they have been proved completely and utterly wrong, I suspect that we would still be unwise to put everything on hold while we waited for them to admit as much. Something that I find interesting about all this is that the vast majority of bars in town which extended their opening hours opted for an extension of only one or two hours; yet this has been enough to make a significant difference to the safety of the town’s streets and also to the simple pleasure of being able to drink when you want to, rather than being forced into a mad rush. It has, in short, made the town a better place to live. Here--in microcosm--we see the triumph of the German/European model of civilised public drinking. I feel a song coming on…
	<p />
	Of course, back in the fifties, British people didn’t fear drinking. No, once they’d enjoyed a nice gin and tonic after work, they would go and get their fear in the same place that they got their thrills, their music and their romance: the picture house.

	Very shortly before I was born, Hammer pictures outraged critics and delighted terrified punters with Horror of Frankenstein. By the time that I was lying, tripping and drooling, in my pram, Hammer had scored a sensational hit with the follow-up, the version of Dracula that introduced Christopher Lee to the role. Both pictures were directed by Terence Fisher, who happened to drink in the same bar as my grandfather and parents. As I grew old enough to talk to, I knew him as “Uncle Terry.” I saw a picture of Uncle Terry in the latest issue of Fortean Times. He looks almost exactly as I remember him. He was a gentle, kindly man and he used to make me laugh like a drain. I was very fond of Uncle Terry. My parents moved away from west London, so we didn’t see so much of Uncle Terry then. One evening when I was perhaps six-years-old, my mum said to me: “Ooh, one of Uncle Terry’s pictures is on the telly tonight? Do you want to stay up and watch it with me?” Well, here I am in this scary place in the country somewhere up the M1 and in my six-year-old mind Uncle Terry is a warm memory of happier times around my granddad’s bungalow at the bottom of Strawberry Hill. Of course I want to see his picture. My mum, bless her, was an intelligent woman, who worked in the very male world of financial journalism and many other areas without once complaining or doing anything other than getting on with the job. She smoked and drank all the time she was pregnant with me and, thank God, she had the sense to turn down the marvelous new miracle drug Thalidomide that she was offered by the doctor. But somewhere in that powerful brain of hers she had completely failed to make the connection between scary house in the country, six-year-old boy and—uh--"Dracula.”
	<p />
	And so at an age when most of my schoolyard chums were enjoying Blue Peter or Batman or those little war comics they used to have, I became a horror movie buff. A Terry Fisher movie was good for staying up late, for a start, and there were always comical interludes with the likes of Miles Malleson or even Bernard Cribbins, in which I could actually feel Uncle Terry’s sense of humour on that sort of deep, trippy emotional level that kids have, almost as though he were there. Obviously a lot of the film would be lost on me, especially the more sensational aspects, probably, for my kiddie mind tended to be predominantly concerned with narrative, but I soon grew able to tell the good from the bad from the ugly. I was rarely terrified. I was, after all, a first generation, first show of first series Doctor Who viewer, fearless before Dalek and Undead alike. I suppose today some clown would try to prosecute my mum for child cruelty or something like that. To these people I say: Bollocks. I’d rather be exposed to this deeply camp and rather improbable variety of fear than the grindingly mendacious, divisive and poisonous fear that you peddle in the name of “security” or “freedom.”
	<p />
	Hammer shut down in the year that I left school. By then I had seen just about everything that the studio had produced, and much more besides. Apart from my love of football, I was a goth waiting to happen. Around about the time that the JBC started up I had a dream in which I went to this typical Northampton house party with Count Dracula. He was there in this little terraced house with cans of Stella and spliffs on the go, with all his Dracula stuff on and people were acting a little strange around me because he was my mate. "Aw, why did you bring him?" sort of thing. Dracula and I went into the little front room where some stoners were watching T.V. Inevitably, the film on the telly was the Bela Lugosi Dracula. So I sit there on the sofa in this darkened, smoky room watching Dracula…with Dracula. It’s worth mentioning that David J, author of “Bela Lugosi’s Dead,” is about six months older than me. There must be a whole generation of us around the place: raised on pop music, football (we were seven or eight when England won the World Cup), The Avengers, The Prisoner, Hammer Horror and Monty Python. I wonder what all the other middle aged weirdoes are up to...
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Was there ever a moment when you considered walking away from music? If so, what changed your mind?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I quite often walk away from music. I usually go straight to the Racehorse. Some music, to be honest with you, is pretty bloody awful. You were probably hoping for a less literal response, right?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Well, it’s entirely up to you…
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> To be honest, if I were to walk away from music, what purpose would it serve? Who would suffer? Not music, that’s for sure; only me, really. Music is one of the few things that I understand at all in this world, so I can’t see why I should ever try to take that away from myself.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> The JBC seemed to avoid the scorn of the English press over the years. What outlets have been most supportive?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, we pretty much avoided the U.K. press altogether after a certain point. We got pretty good reviews for the most part in the early years. They were so helpful that we started getting gigs outside the country. I think a lot of people in Britain thought we were making it up about the small successes that we enjoyed in other countries. All I can say to them is: where the hell do you think we were all that time, then? A few particular people have helped the band enormously with their media support: ${deirdre} at KCRW, God rest her soul, was hugely influential in our becoming known on the West Coast and ${brent} on CBC’s “Brave New Waves” did wonders for us in Canada, and also, thanks to the CBC’s mega-powerful transmitters, all along the Canadian border in America, too. Detroit and Minneapolis are two examples that leap to mind, and so is the small but extremely cool pocket of JBC resistance in God-Fearing Erie, Pennsylvania.
	<p />
	In the early days in the U.K. Robin Gibson at Sounds and ${mercer} at Melody Maker and Zigzag championed the band in a really cool way. We’ve had nice reviews from other writers I admire like Keith Cameron and Dave Kavanagh, who wrote that great big, studious book on Creation Records.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Do you read the reviews
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I always enjoy reading reviews, good or bad. I’m very vain.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> From "Olof Palme" to "JB V PM" there's a strain of politics that can be found in your body of work. What's your take on the current political situation in England?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> To be honest, I’m a bit despairing. The New Labour project has made some things better “on the ground” in the U.K. but it has also been so desperate not to upset the rich that it has presided over a period in which the gap between rich and poor has grown wider; hardly what one would expect from a Labour Government. I would like to see these “billionaires” over which our tabloid press so loves to coo, paying some flapping income tax. What people tend to forget now about the Blair thing is that, prior to 11th September 2001, things might not have been exactly hunky-dory, but the wind was blowing in a fairly civilised direction. Since the White House junta initiated its unwisely-titled “war on terror,” the authoritarian tendencies of our Government have run out of all control: frightened people who had never run so much as a Scout Troop before taking control of the U.K., suddenly paralysed by fear of the unknown and sucked into an ill-advised foreign military adventure of no relevance to U.K. interests whatsoever, snarling terrified at their own people, spying, snitching and behaving as though we had never won the Second World War: shameful stuff. The U.K. was subjected to some 30 years of urban terror by the IRA, much of whose funding, incidentally, came from the United States (“go after states that sponsor terrorism,” was it, Mister Bush?). At one point the IRA blew up the centre of Manchester. The entire bloody town centre! In 1984 they came within a few inches of taking out Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister herself. Yet, even under the leadership of an enraged Thatcher, we didn’t see the ridiculous, racist surveillance society that has installed itself here today. From 1939 to 1945, London was regularly bombed by the German Luftwaffe. My grandma came home one evening just in time to watch a V-1 doodlebug fall from the sky and demolish the flat that she was about to enter. People in America may not be used to being under fire, but British people have had plenty of it, and you know what? We’re really not that flapping bothered. So the nasty little authoritarian thing that is going on right now is profoundly un-British and a lot of people quite rightly don’t care for it.
	<p />
	What they used to say about the IRA and the rest of them was simply that if we started to militarise the place or start chipping away at our freedoms and rights just because of a few bombers, “the terrorists would have won.” It was a proper cliché in our media for years. Apparently Tony Blair never happened across it.
	<p />
	I am fairly sure that Blair was blackmailed into the Iraq thing by the U.S.A., probably with threats of massive dis-investment by giant U.S. corporations if he didn’t play ball. Having followed the deeply flawed Thatcherite model of turning London into some pathetic parody of a European Hong Kong, the new Labour people would be terrified of something like that.
	<p />
	We should not be in Iraq and we certainly should not be in Afghanistan. Ask any British military leader. Or any Red Army strategist or soldier. Or read a damn book. Afghanistan is un-invadable. The British really should know better. On at least two previous occasions they have tried to “subdue” Afghanistan and been sent home with their tails between their legs and nasty cuts and bruises all round.
	<p />
	So, anyway, we all voted Labour and we’ve ended up with stupidly rich people paying laughably low taxes (when, that is, they don’t just evade them altogether) and driving their children to school is bloody great 4x4 cars while everybody else is watched by paramilitary, trigger-happy police in case they say something that Blair doesn’t like. We’re fighting two unwinnable wars that have nothing to do with us and which have dragged the reputation of this country through the dirt worldwide, ramping up into the bargain the possibility that some people would now actually be quite agreeable to the idea of attacking us in some way. Terrific!
	<p />
	But what is the alternative? Anyone who is taken in by Cameron and his shiny, caring Conservative Party needs to have their head examined. Actually no, not “examined” exactly, more sort of “held in an iron vice and battered to a fine mulch by skinheads with mallets with big ugly rusty nails poking out of the business end.”
	<p />
	We have a local council election on Thursday. It is only for people to represent this tiny corner of NN1 on the town council, but it’s still politics and I’m still interested. I wrote a blog about the Conservative candidate who sported a little “Vote Blue, Go Green” logo on his leaflet and then went on to explain that his interests included “Formula 1, boating and flying.” Oh, for heaven’s sakes.
	<p />
	The Conservatives labour under this delusion that all they need to make themselves electable again is to refine their “presentation.” That’s what all this “green” crap is about. They are the party of big business, for heaven’s sakes, and it’s not as though they haven’t lied before. For people so obsessed with “presentation” to be so mind-meltingly inept at it does rather suggest to me that it might be better not to vote for the morons.
	<p />
	Just while I’m here…Formula 1--what government on earth that was in any way serious about carbon emissions would tolerate Formula Flapping 1? These people fly around the globe, week in week out. They distort local economies for a few days, then all pile out and pour top quality pollution into the air for hours and hours. Stop Formula 1 (and other motor racing too, why not?) and see those polar bears get happy. That’s what I say.
	<p />
	I know that a lot of people do get pleasure from Formula 1 (must be high on the fumes), but then a lot of people get pleasure from kicking strangers’ heads in in pub car parks, which is--let it be said--frowned upon by the authorities. Hey, all I’m asking for is a little more consistency.
	<p />
	The Labour Candidate promises me that he’s going to get tough on crime. I imagine that this is very bad news for the six or seven teenagers who stand around in the street of an evening.
	<p />
	God help me, I think I’m going to vote for the Green lady. She only lives round the corner. Vote local.
	<p />
	Bloody hell, has it come to this?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Can you talk a bit about the origins of the Masters of Budvar?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> In November 2003, my friend and neighbour Andy Skank asked me if I would like to play an acoustic night at the Northampton Labour Club. I told him “yes” and duly turned up for something called “Acoustic All Stars.” Andy organises the music at the Labour Club, but this night was the work of another scenester, who had, quite evidently, lost interest in it. It was a moribund affair, whose high point came when a patient from the local mental hospital graced us with a couple of numbers.
	<p />
	So in January 2004, when Andy came and asked me if I would like to take over “Acoustic Allstars,” I said “No.”
	<p />
	Andy persisted, however, and pointed out that he had just bought the club a lovely little PA system and a couple of lights. I thought “all right, I’ll organise a night and see how it goes.” I played and three other “acoustic” acts. It went all right so I did another one the next month. That, too, went well. It was around this time that I made enquiries as to whether the club had to remain “acoustic.” I was told that it didn’t have to stay that way, but to avoid drum & bass music because the guys who run the club have a thing against it. So then I put on Slipstream, who filled the room with noise, but also--crucially--punters. After that, we were away. A couple of months later I put on Rolo from the Woodentops, doing a live DJ set. He played lots of what can only be described as drum and bass music. The old boy who runs the place came up at the end of the night and told me how much he had liked the music.
	<p />
	Well, from that point on, I figured I was winning. I changed the name of the club. I started contacting mates and pulling favours, getting name acts down for a fraction of their regular fee. At the same time, it was still more than the club was giving me, but I figured that everybody has a hobby on which they squander their dough. At least my hobby was running a nightclub--how cool was that?
	<p />
	I have spent literally thousands of pounds on Masters of Budvar. The joke is that we run it for the artists, not the audience. I even managed to get that line on BBC national Radio One when they interviewed me about the club last year. For some reason, which will probably never be explained, we got a rave review in the New York Times once: “If you only go out of London once on your trip to the U.K., make it a trip to Masters of Budvar in Northampton.” I honestly have no idea what that was about.
	<p />
	Our current format is to present two live acts and a superstar DJ. Since I started the superstar DJ thing last year, it’s been a lot of fun. We have mostly local celebrities, though we did have Sonic Boom once recently. Hey, he seems local to me. Andy’s PA is sweet and capable of handling quite complex set-ups. We give the musicians a proper soundcheck and a hot dinner if they’ve come from out of town. We pay them before they go on. Everyone gets paid at Masters of Budvar. It’s a rule. (I am the exception which proves the rule. That’s why you’ll often find me on the bill when an expensive out-of-town band is playing.) We’ve got a good local reputation and a regular crowd of hipsters. Once everything is cleared away, the hardcore will most likely gather back at my place. Sometimes the acoustic guitars come out and two or three more artists will play. My friend Joe Woolley has made a particular habit of this. It’s a brilliant move because all these musicians from out of town hear him under the best possible circumstances (comfy chair, glass of beer) and then go home with fond memories and, as often as not, a CD.
	<p />
	We've hosted acts from Northampton and around, self-evidently, but also acts from London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Bristol, Southampton, Brighton, Belfast, Berlin, Los Angeles and San Gabriel, Ca.
	<p />
	Since we started Masters of Budvar, loads of other, younger musicians and promoters have started nights at the Labour Club, many of which are really good, but I do jealously guard the “original and best” tag.
	<p />
	People can always keep with events at Masters of Budvar by visiting www.myspace.com/patfish77. Plug.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> My favorite cover you do is "Crocodile Tears and the Velvet Cosh"--it's just sublime. I saw you do it in 1991 and it was just crushingly lovely. I think it's quite simply, a perfect song. Your "Skinheads" and "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" are also wonderful. What are some of your favorite ones to do?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Right now my favourite acoustic cover versions are “Nature Boy,” “Weed Smoker’s Dream” and “Moon River.” My favourite covers with the laptop are John Cale’s “Thoughtless Kind,” Suicide’s “Che” and David J’s “Stop This City.” I also like to play “Woke Up This Morning” by Alabama 3.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Ever thought about a covers album?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> A covers album would be awfully good fun, but it probably wouldn’t pay very well, because I’d get no writing money from it, and, to be honest with you, the writing is where the money is.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Will there be a new JBC record?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, I've learned never to say never. Wetlands Reserve, NYC September 1999: the promoters have taken it upon themselves to sell this as the Last JBC Show Ever. We didn't ask them to, but you could see their point of view, given as it was the last show of a reformation tour. In the ladies’ lavatory a girl is heard to ask: "Wow, do you really think this is the last JBC show ever?" A voice replies from inside a stall: "Nah--they've lied before."
	<p />
	Right now, the only record on the horizon is Max Eider's third album (in 20 years--that boy needs to slow down a little). I have no deal at the moment, and no real prospect of getting one, as I have no idea how to do that. I don't yet have the facilities at home to record the way that Max does. So I'm dependent on a studio budget and I can't afford to do that myself.
	<p />
	Nonetheless, I have a lot of new songs and I am vaguely thinking that it would be good to get them on a record one day. Nobody knows, to be honest. You just can't say.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> I told Jim from the Jasmine Minks that I thought the two of you should from some kind of side project supergroup--ever thought about something along these lines?
	</div>

	<a name="undertakers"><div id="undertakers" class="iview_a"> I’m always up for collaborations with agreeable people. Jim does live quite a long way away from me, though; in another country, in fact. It will be good to see his face when we play together in July.
	<p />
	In 1995 a friend with a bar made me form a supergroup to keep him entertained on a slow Wednesday night. We had me, Mark Refoy (Guitarist: Spacemen 3, Spiritualised, Slipstream, Pet Shop Boys); Tim Harries (Bassist: Eno, Steeleye Span, David Holmes, Katie Melua!) and Jon Mattock (Drummer: Spacemen 3, Spiritualised. Slipstream, Perfect Disaster, The Breeders, Massive Attack). The set was all covers. I remember we did the Velvets’ “Foggy Notion,” Can’s “Mother Sky,” some Plastic Ono Band stuff, “Suzie Q,” “Roadrunner” and a few others. We called ourselves The Undertakers. We only ever did it twice. In a sort of KLF moment, I sold the only cassette of the show for £80.
	<p />
	My other band, Wilson, was described by the local radio station as a “Northampton supergroup.” We laughed long and hard. We are, however, a super group, even if I do say it myself.
	</div></a>

	<div class="iview_q"> "Racheland" is emotionally devastating and contains some of your most frank lyrical confessions ("The man next door is having a nervous breakdown/Sounds like it's me in there"), while the moment in "Angels" when you sing "I wanna hold you in my arms" is true aural longing. Sorry for the preamble, but I'm curious to know if writing about a love gone wrong is something you find therapeutic.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I think that writing about most things is therapeutic.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> If someone shouts for "Racheland" is that a place you'd sometimes rather not visit?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Well, I wouldn’t try to play it if I didn’t have a band or a backing track with me, but that’s just a practical consideration. No one wants to listen to six minutes of a bloke whining over two chords on an acoustic guitar. It’s as though the words don’t really work without the music. Hey, I know nothing about poetry, except that it can be a bit of a nuisance. But, assuming that it’s “on,” I have no problem with playing “Racheland.” In fact, I’d say that I enjoy it.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> How do songs like this fare for you years later?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> For the most part, the art-misery jobs seem to stand up fairly well. I still regularly try to wring something out of “Sister Death,” for example, and I played “Angels” as an encore not long ago. “Susie” sounds a bit weak now. Not so bad to listen to, but you don’t necessarily want those words in your mouth at my age. Looks kinda self-pitying, which it wasn’t supposed to be back in the day. It was supposed to be a bit self-critical, but I don’t think my writing powers were up to it.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Let's talk about women.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> Must we?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> Do you find that your heart breaks and soars the same way it did when you were 17?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a"> I hadn’t really thought about this, but, um, yes. Eighteen, anyway.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q"> You must have some stories!

	Your label boss says the most appalling things about you in the press release. I don’t know if you’ve seen it? Maybe you could go on one of those team-building exercises at an executive retreat, paint-balling, something like that? He even paid the illustrator to turn you into Ray Davies, styled after Aerosmith. You must have been livid!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Augustus is a drunk, a bastard and a fraud and you can quote me on that. No jury in the land would convict.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	The picture inside the cover of the album shows a man with his back to a girlfriend in his bedroom, clutching his guitar instead, an album sleeve of himself plainly visible to the world. How close a picture is that to reality, a man consumed by the beast that is music?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	When I’m doing it, it consumes me totally. I have made one or two game efforts to give it up but I can’t. I’m a lifer.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	According to myspace you’re Pop/Alternative. An alternative to what?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Good question. In my case, I suppose ‘alternative’ simply means ‘almost unknown’.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	I read the rambling interview at www.caughtinthecarousel.com from a devoted fan, and it highlights just how long the gaps were between records. Is this a cause of distress at any time, or do you find yourself simply happy to have an album every five, or nine years, with some other recording for others in-between, and the occasional gig? In theory you could, presumably, have been doing CD-R releases since the late 90’s but haven’t chosen to do so. How badly do you worry about such things?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	To be absolutely honest, in my less light-hearted moments I see my sparse output as a sort of self-betrayal. My excuse is that it’s only fairly recently that the technology become good enough to make high-quality home recordings. And it ain’t easy, however good the technology. If I had the choice, I would still leave that side to professionals. Anyway, I’m glad the technology is there, and if the songs keep coming, the gaps will be smaller in the future.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Let’s simplify things for people unaware of your work. Pre-Jazz Butcher bands, what did you do musically, apart from the hideous King Crimson type school band (what were they called?) – was it Punk which truly set fire to those musical loins? Which bands most impressed you and managed to dislodge Pink Floyd and Gong from your clearly addled mind?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	The Velvet Underground dislodged quite a lot. The other groups that really lit my fire around that time – Television, The Only Ones, Talking Heads for example – weren’t Punk. I did find some early Punk really exciting, but I felt like a fraud, because I was a bit of a muso. During my late teens the bands I was in were very confused musically. And in every other way, come to think of it.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Jazz Butcher – how much work was there and what do you think of it now?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	In the 80s we did four studio albums plus a live album and various singles and EPs. Pat Fish is a hugely gifted and under-rated songwriter and I’m proud of the stuff we did together, though the first album is perhaps a bit too ropey and the fourth one not quite ropey enough.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Earlier Max albums: 1987 – The Best Kisser In The World. Your label goes bankrupt – did that cause a massive dent in things for you? Usually independent labels don’t give their artists anything anyway, it’s just a way to get the records out, so I can see it being an annoyance, but then it’s an astonishing 14 years between albums!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	The bankruptcy of my label wouldn’t have been such a problem if I’d been able to find another one in the next 13 years.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	2001 – Hotel Figueroa – did doing this is America make much difference? Writing on the road, lost in the glory of the American highways? A one-man Clash?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I did go a bit native but I’m not sure how much that comes over. What may have made a big difference was the fact that I was recording in the middle of a thick fog of the finest Californian grass Not smoked by me, or at least not deliberately – I’d long since given up the habit – but when I got home I realised I’d been stoned out of my mind for two months.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	In between work with David J – and lots of it. Did you only play with him in the States or worldwide?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Just the States and Canada – and a few in the UK.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Tell me of your night with Joe Strummer and tequila. I’m assuming he was either a big JB, ME and DJ fan and had to be drunk to be able to approach you?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Yes – he was very shy and normally, as I’m sure you’ve heard, he never touched the stuff. The wonderful thing about Strummer was that his enthusiasm for the whole shabby business was undiminished – and totally infectious. He’d been doing an interview for an LA radio station, and we were next up for a live spot. We didn’t know he was there until I looked up after our soundcheck and saw him with his face pushed up against the glass of the control room giving us the thumbs up. Disconcerting. He ended up hanging out with us for the rest of the day and he made us feel as if, for a day at least, he’d become our no. 1 fan. I guess he made everyone feel like that. I remember sitting next to him in a cab as we passed the Roxy on Sunset Boulevard, where we were playing that night, and it had a ‘sold out’ sign up by Dave’s name. And he was bouncing up and down with excitement: ‘Look – you’ve sold out the Roxy! You’ve sold out the fuckin’ Roxy!’ He was more excited about it than we were. Afterwards he came back to the hotel and we set about the Jose Cuervo in earnest. He was very complimentary about the gig but he had a thing about Dave’s guitar – one of those Ovation electric acoustic jobs with a plastic back. He kept going on about how Dave needed ‘the big wood’, not that ‘thwacky-thwacky Ovation shite’. The next morning Dave went back down to Sunset Boulevard and blew $2000 on a big, beautiful, vintage Guild acoustic. We called it ‘The Big Wood’, and Owen (Jones – the accordionist/percussionist) later wrote a song about the episode. Joe Strummer made an impression.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Appearances across the years with Pat Fish, after leaving the Butcher? Reforming, clearly, but occasionally?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Not until the late 90s, when the Jazz Butcher had officially been disbanded. Then occasionally, and then more, and now we’ve stopped for the time being.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	On that interview you mention a gig done at someone’s 60th birthday party, where the sons who had organised it for their father were all JB fans but naturally his dad and collected friends weren’t. What did they, overall, make of you? Did they riot?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	No – I wish they had. Generally they politely ignored us, which wasn’t hard as the garden was quite big and we were playing in a kind of conservatory. But at one point it pissed with rain and they had to take cover. As soon as it stopped, they all cleared out again. We’ve played a few such unpromising events over the years and sometimes they’re surprisingly successful. For instance, at one wedding, in Monterey, the grandparents started jiving to ‘Zombie Love’.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Work with others?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I did sessions and gigs from time to time with people if they asked and I liked them or their music.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	You mention freelance writing and editing has helped you keep the wolf from the door, although could always invite him in, as they tend be clean, but what sort of writing do you do?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I’m glad to hear that the wolf is clean, because he may be moving in soon. I’ve mainly done vaguely educational stuff for broadcasters and NGOs.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	How weird is it being someone in the Internet with an album out but no gigs to gauge responses by? Do you get much of the way in feedback form people through your site(s) and is that enough?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	It’s pretty weird, and I sometimes feel as if the whole thing is a pathetic exercise in vanity publishing. But for various reasons gigging is a non-starter, in the UK at least. I do get some feedback through the websites. Plus there’s a small number of loyal and enthusiastic supporters who do their best to make me feel it’s all worthwhile. Of course I know quite a few of my ‘fans’ personally after all this time, which is nice, although it makes it a bit embarrassing to take their money.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Is it different it any way to the past; more informative or instructive, or more infuriating?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	There’s certainly more of it – more direct feedback – these days, because of the internet, and I suppose I make more of an effort to be approachable, because there’s no one else trying to promote my stuff, and I genuinely appreciate it when someone takes an interest. I do get some questions about what equipment I use and so on, which are a bit tedious, but mostly people are just friendly and supportive.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Your newest album, let’s have a look. ‘I Want’ is a lovely pop song but the protagonist sounds a bit of a bastard, taking rather than giving much!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	It’s less about a particular character than about our (my) endless desire for what I haven’t got, or for more of some things I have got – not even knowing half the time what I want, but vaguely knowing that I want it. It’s not an attractive aspect of the psyche. I had thought I was talking about a shared experience but maybe I’m just a bit of a shit.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Whenever I hear that jazzily style of ‘Secret Life’ I can’t help thinking of the old kids TV show Vision On. I was scarred by it. This clearly isn’t a problem for you. When Punk and its aftermath was happening I’m assuming you had a varied album collection of guitarists?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	In fact, the music to Vision On is closely associated in my mind with the loss of the will to live. I’m generally quite bored by instrumental jazz unless it’s really exceptional – Duke Ellington or Miles Davis or something. For me, it’s always been about songs. But I have spent quite a lot of time listening to treatments of songs in the ‘standard’ repertoire, which of course tend to have a jazzy feel, and I do waddle into that territory from time to time, when the song seems to call for it.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Was that song sparked off by some nutter in the press and how people view the loner, or just another look at a deceitful relationship?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I like that ‘just’ – the implication that the way we view some homicidal nutter in a newspaper story is somehow more interesting than the way we relate to the people we’re supposed to love. But as it happens the original idea did come from reading about a suicide bomber and what a nice quiet boy everyone thought he was. And then I started thinking about how little any of us really know about what’s going on the minds of the people near to us.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘My Dreams’ is stunning and quite shocking. You must have some seriously disturbing dreams?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Well this is a story, and the narrator is not me, but of course there’s some sort of emotional connection, and it’s my warped mind that came up with the story. Certainly I read that phrase somewhere – ‘May all your dreams come true’ – and I thought, ‘My god, what a thing to wish on someone.’ Like the Chinese curse wishing someone interesting times.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Dirty Old Man’ is sad, wistful and quite peculiar. Not only do you make growing old sound awful you let everyone else know their life will be shitty? Aren’t Bauhaus lacking a singer? You could apply. ‘Can invest situations with grim undertones at the drop of a hat.’
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	The worrying thing is that I see the mood of this album as generally positive. While I was making it I collected a stock of ideas for the next album, which I rejected for this one on the grounds that they were too dark. So that’s something to look forward too, isn’t it?
	<p />
	‘Dirty Old Man’ is about one specific aspect of getting older, and it is sad and wistful, but it’s also about coming to terms with it. I wanted to write about those feelings because they’re considered shameful, despite the fact that they’re hard-wired and pretty much universal, at least for men: at some point in your life, like it or not, and not many of us do like it I don’t think, you’re going to find yourself fancying someone who’s young enough to be your daughter or son, and eventually, presumably, your grand-daughter or grandson. So the song says: hey, don’t feel so bad, there’s no shame unless you do something about it. And even if you do something about it, as long we’re talking about adults and not children, it’s not wrong, just (probably) very ill-advised. A lot depends on the circumstances of course. I know I’m her schoolteacher but she told me she was forty-five, your honour.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Love’s Blind’ has a similar message, done with humour “just as one door closes he said, another slams in your face.” I’m thinking inspirational speaker/ life coach might not be the alternative career for you.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	No definitely not. I’m not a fan of the self-improvement/counselling culture. And I’m beginning to worry they’re not going to offer me the Bauhaus job either.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Closing Time’ sounds gorgeous but it’s another weird relationship? I kept expecting some talk of revenge but you seem so easy-mannered.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Not so weird: it’s just about an affair that one person takes much more seriously than the other. The twist is that, having ended the relationship, the one who cared less turns up out of the blue and gets seductive. So the other one, the bloke, has to decide what to do about it, knowing that his ex-lover has a comparatively lighthearted and casual approach to life and love. There’s no malicious intent: she just doesn’t take things to heart as he does. This is not a situation I’ve been in myself but it’s one that happened to someone I know and it just had ‘song’ written all over it.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	That goes double into ‘Sweet Nothing’ like the anti-speed dater, one man and his sun dial.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	‘Sweet Nothing’ is a kind of manifesto. In my experience, decisive action of any kind is almost always a mistake. And it’s that attitude, as the song says, that has got me where I am today.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Neutral Tones’ love must demonstrate the potency of love, as no-one else would consider using White City as a ravishing backdrop!
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, it’s set after nightfall.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Stupid Heart’ is almost optimistic but still lacking any happy ending.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	This is about taking the knocks without hardening the heart. What do you want, Love Actually?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘It’s Come To This’ again trundles through disappointment. So, playing devil’s advocate, does playing light and lush songs about love’s downside get you a get out of jail free card in the Melodic Court Of Justice while the likes of Tony Hadley or Chris De Burgh go to the firing squad? Is it the unhappiness which works, as you’re in the same big anteroom of Singer Songwriter Covering Emotion. How do you avoid do a Lady In Red?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I suppose this is a fair question, but I don’t really think it’s for me to answer. People can make up their own minds, if they’re interested. I do what I do with whatever insight, wit and talent I can muster. Judging whether or not, in the end, it’s a pile of old shite is your job.
	<p />
	One thing though: if it is, in the end, a pile of old shite, my ‘Lady In Red’, do I get to sell some fucking records then?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Booze is often around in songs – what’s the greatest drinking song you have ever heard, and what do envy about it?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I love Pat Fish’s contribution on the Jazz Butcher album A Scandal In Bohemia, ‘Soul Happy Hour’ – ‘I wish I’d been born a tree / Someone might have made a barrel out of me / I get in a phewery / When I’m not in a brewery.’ Now that’s a lyric. I also love Dean Martin singing ‘Little Ole Wine Drinker Me’ – he’s trying to drink off a broken heart but he sounds as if he’s really enjoying it. Dishonourable mention too for ‘The Piano Has Been Drinking’ by Tom Waits – it’s just so drunk, and it gets the element of denial essential to the true alcoholic.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	‘Kings And Queens’ comes to you through Sting! Can you explain the purpose of the song because I’m not strictly sure what you’re saying there, it’s almost like the end has you approving of a troupe of imbeciles?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, Sting got up in front of whatever award ceremony it was, and he’d been adjudged the best songwriter and best shag in the history of the world or whatever it was, and he looked the camera in the eye and said: ‘Music is its own reward’. Then he took off his shirt and played ‘Message in a Bottle’. And something inside me snapped.
	<p />
	‘Kings and Queens’ is a song celebrating people for whom music really is its own reward – people who aren’t multi-award-winning multi-millionaires, people who make music that no one hears, people who sit singing and strumming in bedrooms, rehearsing week after week in unspeakable rehearsal rooms and never playing a gig, or playing the same crap gigs over and over again to two men and a dog; people for whom the rock ‘n’ roll dream never died, or has long since died, or was never born, but who do it, well, why? – for whatever reason. Because it’s what they do. Because at some level they want to or must do it. They are the Kings and Queens.
	<p />
	What the fuck did you think it was about?
	<p />
	Can you tell I’ve had a couple of drinks now?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Next album around 2012, or are you on a roll?
	</div>

	<div class="iview_a">
	I’m on a roll mate. Soon there will be more albums than fans.

	<div class="iview_q">
	How did you meet Dave Barker from Glass Records ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Pat Fish : In 1981 I was in a band called the Sonic Tonix. We had made a self-financed seven-inch single and we were looking for distribution, which involved phoning up lots of strangers and asking for help. While talking to somebody at Illuminated Records I was pointed in the direction of this chap Dave Barker, who was just starting his own label, Glass. He actually included a tune by that band on his compilation album The Wonderful World of Glass – Vol 1.
	<p />
	After the Tonix split up at the end of 1981 I moved to Northampton. By chance, there were a couple of bands in Northampton who were working with Dave, so I got to know him better. (Although he was based in London, he would often come up to Northampton for a gig or a weekend visit.) When I started making little tapes of my own at home, I sent him some songs. By the middle of 1982 we were talking about recording an album.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Most of your records are recorded at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire in Woodbine Studios. Why did you choose these studios ? What are your best memories ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	By the time we went there, Dave Barker had been using Woodbine for a little while. He put out two particular records that were made there, which we thought had a lovely sound. One was the Jacobites album by Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; the other was a track by David J on his Crocodile Tears album, a song called Slip the Rope. The records had a fabulous “wide-screen” sound, but one that was based on a very simple, honest, acoustic foundation. It was that sound that I was hoping to find there.
	<p />
	Leamington is only an hour’s drive from Northampton, where David and I lived, so it was convenient in that way. During the working week we stayed in Leamington in rooms above a lovely little restaurant run by two charming chaps called Eric and Julian. On our first night in Leamington, after the recording session, we went steaming into the first bar that we found. It turned out to be entirely and exclusively populated by Sikhs. We drank there every night. When we made Scandal in Bohemia, it was the middle of the summer. If we weren’t recording, we would be playing football in the studio car park. It really was rather idyllic.
	<p />
	By contrast, we made Sex and Travel in the depths of winter, with snow on the ground. The studio became a warm little retreat, the atmosphere very intimate. John Rivers at Woodbine has a really strong work ethic and knows how to keep a session running easily and well.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	What's the reason behind the title of this boxset ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, we were young men, suddenly exposed to the life of a touring rock and roll band – free liquor and all the rest of it. Of course we were wasted...
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	How easy was the remastering process of your albums ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	For me, very easy. I was not involved in the process at all.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Why did you choose to work with Brian Pyle ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	It was not our choice, but that of the record company. I think they use him for just about everything. I thought that he did a good job on the Fire release of our last album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, so I have no problem with any of this.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	Big Saturday is my favorite song of Sex And Travel. What's the story of this song ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Before the band went “full-time” towards the end of 1984, I used to have a day job working for a local lawyer. One of my regular duties was to take care of things that needed to be in done in London at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand. (It was much cheaper to send me on these missions than a “real” lawyer, of course.) Among the things that needed attention were Bankruptcy Petitions.
	<p />
	Now, the Bankruptcy department at the Royal Courts of Justice was infamous in those days. Quite rightly (considering that people turn up there trying to make somebody bankrupt!), they were unbelievably fastidious about how the Petitions were made out. One typing error, one small mistake and they would simply refuse to issue the Petition, sending the unfortunate legal clerks like me back to their angry employers with the job not done.
	<p />
	There is no doubt in my mind that all the staff in the Bankruptcy office had developed a real culture of being as awkward and uncooperative as possible. Many of them seemed to take an active pleasure in sending disappointed legal clerks away, their Petitions rejected. At one point, the staff posted a list on the wall of the office: “Top Ten Excuses offered by Legal Clerks”, openly mocking their...uh...customers with lines like “But I’ve come all the way from Newcastle...” and so on.
	<p />
	Everybody dreaded the place. Because I knew the place and the difficult blighters who worked there, I made a real point of getting my Petitions right and generally I got a result, but I didn’t enjoy the experience any more than anybody else.
	<p />
	Except once.
	<p />
	One gorgeous spring day, just before Easter 1983, I visited the Bankruptcy office with a Petition. I wasn’t sure that it was going to work. I found myself dealing with a beautiful young woman, who, although I had never seen her there before, had already completely absorbed the culture of the place: languid, unimpressed, taking her own good time about things. It really suited her. I watched, entranced, as she issued the Petition for me. Job done, I stepped gaily out into the lunchtime sunshine. I was far too young and socially inept to ever dare try to speak to her. Good Heavens, she was from the Bankruptcy office, for goodness’ sakes, some kind of Superior Being to the likes of me. No, I just went out into the sunshine with the treasured memory of her glorious indifference.
	<p />
	Suddenly clouds filled the sky and a stiff wind blew up. In my head I thought: “The weather’s grim but Spring is on its way.”
	<p />
	I phoned my pal Rolo to see what he was doing over the Easter holiday weekend. He said he would be busy doing some recording for this band he was building. “Hey, King, I hope you have a good weekend. I hope you get things done the way that you intend.” The whole Saturday thing relates to Rolo as well and some adventures that we had had with acid, a bit of a private joke. So the middle verses are a little tribute to him for teaching me so much about music. Sometimes, when I hear the song, it sounds to me as though I am trying to sing like him a little bit, but that was not done deliberately.
	<p />
	As the song goes on, you can hear the weather clearing up. The last verse “Hey, girl...” is, of course, the vision in the Bankruptcy office. And, you see, I didn’t forget her.
	<p />
	Back in Northampton, that whole Easter weekend went on to be very strange and very productive. Just off the top of my head I can remember writing Big Saturday, Just Like Betty Page and I Need Meat that weekend, and there were others too, which escape me now. Easter 1983: it was brilliant.
	<p />
	I spent much of Easter 1984 trying to rescue my cat from an enormous tree in the local park. But I didn’t write a song about that.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	It was easy to work with John A. Rivers ? Why did choose this guy ? For this work with Felt ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, I’ve already explained the records that made us want to work with John, but of course we were familiar with his Felt recordings and with the fact that he had recorded the Specials’ awesome Ghost Town. His studio was quite the nicest one that we had ever seen, beautifully maintained. John and I have had our moments. He tends to like things a little bit “tidier” than I do. I like a bit of spillage and a few rough edges here and there, whereas, in the eighties at least, John would go for a bright, polished sound, so very occasionally we might enjoy a full and frank exchange of expert opinion, but for the most part we got on really well. He made things really easy for us. Apart from David, none of us had much proper studio experience, so he met us at the right time and taught us lots of valuable things.
	<p />
	As I said, he has a strong work ethic and firm limits to the working day, so nobody gets bored or over-tired. He can move a session along very well, so that everything is generally brought in on time and on budget. Sex and Travel was recorded and mixed in seven days.
	</div>

	<div class="iview_q">
	What are your relations with yours albums of Glass Records ? Do you love them ?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	Well, everybody loves their kids, I suppose, but I definitely like some of these records more than others. You have to bear in mind that these were our earliest efforts at making records, so we were living and learning, making things up as we went along. Sometimes we got lucky, sometimes not so much.
	<p />
	I had a hell of a time writing sleeve notes for the re-issue of Bath of Bacon. How to explain a record like that one? It feels remote now, though bits of it retain a certain charm. In fact, some of those songs have turned out to have extraordinary staying-power (La Mer is an obvious example) but I don’t listen to the record much at all. I really couldn’t sing in those days. I think perhaps I thought that somehow it wouldn’t matter. I don’t know. I have fond memories of making the record and some of the songs have been very good to me, but do I love the actual album? Not with all that tuneless bellowing all over it, not really.
	<p />
	I’d be a fool not to love A Scandal in Bohemia. That record changed my life. Most of it still holds up well enough. The fact that we weren’t trying to sound fashionable means that it hasn’t dated too badly. Max’s guitar parts here and there are magnificent. I still can’t sing, but it’s not quite as awful as Bath, anyway. At least I’ve got people who can sing around me this time...
	<p />
	Sex and Travel is my favourite of the Glass albums. I really do love that one. It feels complete and it feels like us, if you see what I mean. Both the singing and the song-writing seem to have taken a big step in the right direction, too.
	<p />
	There are things that I don’t like about Distressed Gentlefolk, though when I listen to it I am usually pleasantly surprised. I think that it could have used a couple more decent songs, to be honest, and a bit less digital reverb. Then again, that squeaky plastic crocodile at the end of Domestic Animal still blows my mind and breaks my heart, all at the same time.

<h2 class="entry-title">The Jazz Butcher's Indie Pop Genesis</h2>

				<div>
<p />Very long ago, in the mists of the early 1980s, “indie” and “pop” had not yet conjoined to become a compound word. There was the pop that inhabited the charts, and there was everything else.	<p />
<p class="p1">But the pop that was created and distributed at the independent level was indeed unlike pop as most people know it, both then and now. Transparently low-budget and conspicuously disheveled, it didn’t sound like punk, but it couldn’t have existed without punk’s ripping up of the musical rulebook and demolishing of the barriers to entry. It tended to be melodic but coarse, unaffiliated with recent technology (if the Top 10 was the sound of penthouses, this was the sound of a cement-walled cellar), and its lyrics usually made plain that these were people who were unafraid to flaunt their own intelligence and feelings.	<p />
<p class="p1">In 1983, the Smiths would become the standard-bearers of U.K. indie-pop, bringing the (admittedly vague) notion of the genre to an audience of previously unimaginable size and scope. But before them there were the little-known but trailblazing likes of Orange Juice, The Monochrome Set, Marine Girls, and, almost simultaneous to the Smiths, The Jazz Butcher.	<p />
<p class="p1">The Jazz Butcher, from the town of Northampton, in England’s Midlands, was the brainchild of fellow singer-guitarist-songwriters Pat Fish (aka “the Butcher”) and Max Eider. The purpose of the band, in Fish’s telling, was to “free my mind from the increasingly dank post-punk ghetto that it had been inhabiting.” When a friend lent him a compilation album of 1970s soul hits, he had a vision of a new way forward, and in response, wrote a song called “Partytime” that was a three-and-a-half-minute repudiation of post-punk’s sonic and verbal tendencies toward deadly seriousness. This was bright, wry, happy-to-be-alive music. It was, in its own skewed, understated way, pop.	<p />
<p class="p1">Throughout the following three years, the Jazz Butcher made four albums for Glass Records, an independent label whose business structure—essentially, one man sitting in a room in London—belied the breadth of its achievements, also releasing classic left-of-center albums from the Pastels, Spacemen 3, Nikki Sudden, and many others. Those Butcher recordings have now been collected together on <em><a href="https://thejazzbutcher.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wasted Years</a></em>, a four-CD box set accompanied by a booklet with a fantastically eloquent 5,000-word essay from Fish.	<p />
<iframe width='100%' height='120' style='position: relative; display: block; width: 100%; height: 120px;' src='//bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1095105613/album=4137983860/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/' allowtransparency='true' frameborder='0'></iframe>	<p />

<p class="p1">Above all else, <i>The Wasted Years</i> demonstrates that the Jazz Butcher seemingly existed to throw curveballs. The band’s very name served to confuse and mislead: Max Eider’s stunningly elegant six-string work aside (arguably, only Johnny Marr was a better guitarist at the time), there was nothing explicitly jazz about them. From debut long-player <i>In Bath of Bacon</i> onward, every disc is an exploding confetti bag of styles, moods, and textures, from the Velvet Underground-at-a-sock-hop velocity of “Jazz Butcher Theme,” to the aggressively, hilariously atonal “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e06tr0BGV6k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present</a>,” to the conventional melodiousness and sentimentality of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVgd7oIHuEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Saturday</a>” (<i>the</i> great, lost should-have-been indie number one). Their songs’ common denominator was Fish’s and Eider’s vocals, often delivered with the poker-faced poise of a genial game show host.	<p />
<p class="p1">“We used to reply that we thought surprises were supposed to be a good thing,” says Fish. “A buyer is going to be stuck with your LP for at least a year before the next one comes out, so, come on, give them a little bit of something to chew on, no?	<p />

<p class="p1">“The great liberating album for our generation was <i>London Calling</i> by the Clash,” he offers. “They broke out of the three-chord restrictions of their first album and the faintly dodgy chorus-metal of [second album] <i>Give ’Em Enough Rope</i>, and just played any kind of music they wanted to. At a time when the post-punk mob seemed to be removing more color, texture, and beauty from their music with every passing week, <i>London Calling</i> was a revelation, taking us back to reggae and soul and everything that was possible. From that day on, it was an article of Jazz Butcher faith that ‘punk’ meant playing whatever the hell you wanted.”	<p />
<p class="p1">Following <i>In Bath of Bacon</i>’s very modest public reception—“It cost less than £500 to record; at the time, I had no idea that I would ever make another one,” says Fish—the following year saw the Jazz Butcher exceed everyone’s expectations, including their own. The band became a solidified unit with the addition of drummer Owen Jones and bassist David J, grateful to have found an artistic outlet that was the polar opposite of his recently deceased previous band, goth pioneers Bauhaus. Their 1984 album, <i>A Scandal in Bohemia—</i>made, like every subsequent release for Glass Records, with producer John A. Rivers, whose principal talent was making diminutive indie bands sound like they were playing in a canyon—was such a drastic progression from its predecessor that it seemed five years ahead of itself. It sold more than 20,000 copies.	<p />
<p class="p1">“We found ourselves, rather to our surprise, in the middle of the music game in London at a golden moment where some of the principles of punk had actually become normal business practice,” says Fish. “It didn’t stay that way for long, but for a while there was a genuine feeling that the independent sector was ahead of the major labels. The level of ‘success’ we achieved certainly did surprise us. It completely astonished us. After a year or two, we could no longer cope with it. We were entirely unprepared, which manifests in all sorts of silly ways that you can’t possibly anticipate until you’ve been there. I wouldn’t have missed a second of it.”	<p />

<p class="p1"><i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i> and its follow-up, the mini-album <i>Sex and Travel</i> (Fish’s personal favorite from this period), attracted enough attention that the Jazz Butcher soon signed on the dotted line with labels around the world, including in the U.S. and Canada. While other U.K. bands, who had received more acclaim and sold more records at home, made few inroads internationally, the Jazz Butcher became favorites of college radio audiences abroad. (<i>Bloody Nonsense</i>, a flawless 1986 compilation made exclusively for North America and Australia, has probably served as an introduction for more people than anything else the band did.)	<p />
<p class="p1">“The West Coast of the American continent has always been the place where we’ve done the best business, all the way from Vancouver down to San Diego. Hell of a commute, mind,” says Fish. “We’ve also had regional success in Chicago, Toronto, New York, Hamburg, Valencia, Paris, London, Tokyo... ; all over the place, really; always at club/small theatre-level, and always economically viable.”	
	<p />
<iframe width='100%' height='120' style='position: relative; display: block; width: 100%; height: 120px;' src='//bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=210734432/album=4137983860/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/' allowtransparency='true' frameborder='0'></iframe>	<p />
<p class="p1">Having received what Fish in his box set notes as “the inspirational crash course in liberal education that is touring,” the band—now minus David J, who departed amicably to launch the soon-to-be chart-topping Love and Rockets with two of his former Bauhaus colleagues—returned to the studio to make “our greatest album ever.” Yet the resulting work, <i>Distressed Gentlefolk</i> (which followed very closely on the heels of <i>Bloody Nonsense</i> in 1986), is something of a misfire in Fish’s estimation, despite it remaining a fan favorite to this day. In retrospect, Fish says, there were several contributing factors: him and Eider going “in different directions” as songwriters, David J’s departure leaving an unfillable void, and “fatigue and liquor.” Although the album’s release was followed by a successful first tour of the U.S., Eider left soon after for a vastly underrated solo career. (His debut, <i>The Best Kisser in the World</i>, deserves a garlanded reissue of its own.)	<p />

<p class="p1">This was far from the end of the Jazz Butcher, though. A reconfigured lineup left Glass and signed to the then-emergent Creation Records, where they remained until Fish retired the concept in the middle of the ’90s, their music seemingly too idiosyncratic to find its place in the culturally myopic Britpop years. But the band—variously featuring Eider, Jones, J, and other alumni—has been fitfully active again since the turn of the century. <i>The Wasted Years</i> is by far the greatest of several gestures that keep interest in the Jazz Butcher simmering. Fish views his Glass-era recordings as a memento of a very different time that nevertheless feels at home in the here-and-now.	<p />
<p class="p1">“We never felt the urge to sound fashionable, which is probably why most of those old records still sound enjoyable today,” he says. “We were young and full of enthusiasm and weird, dogmatic ideas, and more than half the time we had no idea what we were doing. We were learning on the job and sometimes falling down in public. It beat the hell out of working in an office.”	<p />

	POSSIBLY TAKING their cue from occasional contributor to their set (in lyric form at least),
	Jonathan Richman, The Jazz Butcher appear to be abandoning their quirky Bonzo-meet-Beefheart
	persona and have added just a touch of muscle in an attempt to assume the mantle of quitessential
	pop rockers. Are you ready for The Rubinoos revival?
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher's closest living relatives, however, are The Violent Femmes. Take away the
	religious fervor/guilt and replace it with songs about goldfish, girls and parties, add a
	soupçon of cynicism and in 40 minutes you have the perfect lyrical content for any occasion.
	Where the Violent Femmes are clever-clever, The Jazz Butcher is just <i>clever</i>.
	<p />
	Musically, though, there is a paucity of anything other that rock guitar and walking bass
	(honorable exceptions being 'Partytime' and 'Real Men').
	<p />
	Nevertheless, even with their new found air of solemnity, The Jazz Butcher are still more
	fun that a cold bath with someone you dislike.

	IN DAYS of yore, Pat Fish a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher — has put his razor-sharp wit to work on death dentists, sex engines and a dance sensation sweeping the country called "the bubonic plague." But on the latest Jazz Butcher longplayer, Condition Blue, he points his lyrical gun at himself.
	<p />
	<p />
	And though there's a lot of dark humor lurking beneath the surface, ${blue} lives up to its title: for the Jazz Butcher, the lyrics are quite serious indeed. Most of the songs deal with a relationship gone sour, and though the music is a typically Jazz Butcher-ish blend of '90s '60s-style ringing guitar pop, the over-all mood is more, ah, sombre than usual.
	<p />
	<p />
	"Encourage people to be attentive," says Fish about his Vancouver date, ${linkInternal(${jbc_gigs}/1992/May27.html, tonight at the Commodore Ballroom)}. "You can probably tell from the LP that it's music for listening to. Don't give anyone the impression they're going to be able to come and watch the funny Englishman get drunk and fall over: they're in for some serious music action."
	<p />
	<p />
	He laughs, but it's a point well taken. Take ${honey}, tune No. 2 on Condition Blue. Musically, it sounds like a slightly dark and ominous "message" song from the '60s (Billy Joe Royal's Cherry Hill Park springs to mind, but Fish says he's never heard of it). Lyrically, it's quite barbed, but still darkly humorous (my favorite lines are "all that honey wants is someone to watch Twin Peaks with/ she'll be kissing frogs 'til the end of judgment day").
	<p />
	<p />
	"It's cheap, childish, vengeful — and accurate," says the 34-year-old tunesmith over the phone from Regina. "There's so much wounded-boy s--- on that record it's not even funny, but hell, I had to do it."
	<p />
	<p />
	"The song really smells of West London, the '50s, sour, middle-aged men in raincoats, cinemas with chewing gum on the seats, and stuff like that. You catch the vibe? I don't know, it makes me think of Elvis Costello a bit -- maybe that's just me being arrogant."
	<p />
	<p />
	How big was the upheaval in his personal life? "Massive. Massive crawling around chewing the carpet howling like a dog kind of upheaval ... I was stupid, it's all my fault, it was totally squalid and in the end I got badly burned. "[But] I don't want to get my dirty underwear out and wave it around people for money. So a lot of the writing has been really ... you know, the Hard Rain thing, where Dylan thought he was gonna get killed, so he'd better write all the best ideas of all the songs he was ever gonna write in one lyric. There's a lot of that allusive stuff rather than elusive stuff going off."
	<p />
	<p />
	One of the positive points of this style of lyric writing is that the songs aren't a quick study. They stand up to repeat listening; even demand it if you're to figure out what the lyrics mean.
	<p />
	<p />
	"You should leave little bombs in there where two years later you go, 'Oh f---, I never noticed that,' " says Fish philosophically. "It's a minefield, the lyrics on that album. There's booby traps and trip wires and snipers hanging around. Especially if you happen to be about 5-foot-4 and Californian."
	<p />
	<p />
	Philosophical statements come easy to the London native. who now lives 90 kilometres north in Northampton. He has a degree in philosophy from Oxford, but doesn't seem overly hoity-toity about it all: he says his favorite philosopher is Lou Reed.
	<p />
	<p />
	Reed's work with the Velvet Underground was one of the big reasons Fish started the Jazz Butcher Experience in the early '80s. The other major influence wass Memphis soul from the '60s.
	<p />
	<p />
	But he does keep abreast of the musical times. The new album's ${girls} is his attempt to "impersonate Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics." It was also his song "for the French" — in the great tradition of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin (Je T'aime).
	<p />
	<p />
	"This poor unfortunate girl," says Fish of the recording session. "She just got out of the car. we stuffed a big old joint in her hand and made her do all this [makes panting noises]."
	<p />
	<p />
	For the spiritual crowd, there's also a new song called ${shirl}.
	<p />
	<p />
	"The song's not about her, though obviously, one has had a thing about her since one was so high. It's some thing that afflicts the male heterosexual element of society. It's more about that Californication culture, all those rich self-help books. They have a certain [look], the colors: on the paperback cover are always of a certain kind, they always look a bit mescaline-damaged or something."

	<h2>Jim remembers Max, Max remembers Wes</h2>
	<div class="iview_intro">
	<p />
	When I arrived in Japan with The Legendary Jim Ruiz Group, I remember the first time we met with an interpreter. We sat down with some people from our record label  Trattoria.  They wanted to know how someone like me had made the record I had when I did.  Flipper’s Guitar had made a very similar album several years earlier called “Three Cheers for Our Side!”  I thought about it for a while and I said “Do you know that Jazz Butcher album ‘Distressed Gentlefolk,’ and that song ‘Who Loves You Now?’”  There were nods all around the table.   ”I wanted to make an album were every song was like that one.”
	<p />
	<p />
	Last year Max Eider released his fourth solo album “Disaffection.”  It was the musical event of the year for me.  He’s one of those rare bands/artists, The Would Be Goods also spring to mind, that  like fine wine, get better as they age.  Backed by the million dollar backing vocals of June Miles Kingston and a talented chromatic harp player, Max is one of those rare people who can speak with their lyrics, and their axe.  I find myself hanging on his every note.  Do yourself a favor and check out his website http://www.maxeider.com  and listen to track 10 on Disaffection “Can’t Touch Me Now”,  hear Max’s guitar playing in full flight – have your mind blown – then buy the record!
	</div>
	<div class="iview_q">
	LJR – It’s 1965 and Wes Montgomery is on the top of his game, he’s recently switched to Verve Records but will sadly be dead in 3 years.  Why do you think he is such a great guitarist and how has he, or his technique, influenced your playing?  Do you have a favorite album or time period or do you find his work all equally brilliant?
	</div>
	<div class="iview_a">
	ME - In answer to your question:
	<p />
	I’m no expert on Wes Montgomery or jazz guitar. But I suppose what I like particularly about Wes Montgomery is the feel and the emotion rather than the technique, or rather, it’s the way he can make the technique serve the emotion. This is not of course an original insight. In fact, it’s one possible definition of good playing in any style and on any instrument. But when someone is THAT good technically, sometimes it subsumes everything else.
	<p />
	<p />
	The first Wes Montgomery album I bought was ‘The Incredible Jazz Guitar of …’ and it just blew me away. There’s an absolutely gorgeous version of ‘Polka Dots and Moonbeams’ which is a good illustration of his peerless musicality: it’s all about delicacy of feel, about tone and emotion. It reminded me, at a time when I probably needed reminding, that playing well slowly is much more difficult than burning up the fretboard. So perhaps that was the main influence. To be honest, when someone is that good, it’s a fine line between being inspired and wanting to chuck your guitar in the river and give up. Perhaps I did kind of give up, come to think of it: over time I began to lose interest in striving to be a better guitarist per se and started to concentrate more on writing and recording songs. This was probably partly because I knew that, even if I could sell my soul for a couple of extra lifetimes, I would never be as good as Wes Montgomery. So what was the point? On the other hand, no one could write Max Eider songs better than I. I was uniquely equipped to do the job.
	<p />
	<p />
	Also, there is a truth that you don’t often hear voiced by musicians, but which every child starting music lessons knows: practising a musical instrument is boring. A lot of it is just frustrating, mindless, tedious, endless schooling of recalcitrant fingers and brain. At least that’s how it is for most of us. For Wes it was probably a breeze. Still, recently I’ve started playing the guitar more again for its own sake, so who knows? If someone discovers the secret of immortality, in a few thousand years I might be ready to release my version of ‘Polka Dots and Moonbeams’.
	<p />
	<p />
	PS  I just dug out my old scratched vinyl copy of ‘The Incredible Jazz Guitar …’ and listened to ‘Polka Dots and Moonbeams’. It made me cry like a girl, and not just from envy. But how can I have forgotten this: it was from this song, and this version, that I stole the opening line of the melody for ‘Who Loves You Now?’
	<p />

	<h2>4CD retrospective from those witty purveyors of indie rock, The Jazz Butcher. Mark Ray reviews for LTW</h2>
	<p />
The Jazz Butcher were one of those undervalued indie bands that proliferated in the 80s. Fronted by Pat Fish, with a perfect guitar foil in Max Eider, and joined for a while by a Bauhaus, they sounded like a Monochrome Set/Smiths/Everything But The Girl mash up. Between 1983 and 1986 the Butcher released four albums and a string of 45s for Glass Records. The four albums, long out of print, have been released in a deluxe box set by Fire Records. It feels long over-due, like welcoming back a much loved eccentric uncle who you last saw popping out for some ready rub twenty years ago.
	<p />
	<p />
Bath of Bacon, their first album for Glass, has the feel of a confident band knocking off songs inspired by long drunken nights and parties involving too many illegal substances. It feels like a band not quite fully formed. But there are great songs here. There’s the happy hour in the abattoir of the Jazz Butcher Theme, the wonderful mellow guitar and clever lyrics of Party Time, the rockabilly vibes of Bigfoot Motel, the dangers of Zombie Love, and the wonderful Girls Who Keep Goldfish, which is about…err…girls who keep goldfish.
	<p />
	<p />
For their next album, A Scandal In Bohemia, the Butcher are joined by David J. of Bauhaus, and it hits the ground running and never lets up. I hadn’t listened to the album in many years and had forgotten just how bloody good it was. This is a band on top form, with a great mixture of clever, quirky, moving songs that once heard, always remain in the mind. It opens with the glorious smooth pop of Southern Mark Smith; a song that in any other universe would have been a smash hit. Maybe it still is. Real Men is a cutting indictment of the male sex. When Fish sings: ‘They ask punk rockers if they’re queer’ and ‘Real men beat up blacks and faggots’, you can’t help but wonder if anything has changed since this classic was first cut. Soul Happy Hour is possibly the greatest song written about drinking ever. Marnie is a stupendous song, falling down like heavy snow on the steppes of mother Russia. A big band back beat to a song about Marnie who is going a little crazy. Alternative songs of the 80s were replete with slightly off kilter, if not crazy, women. Will the snows never cease? Marnie wants to keep wild cats in her room. And why not? Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Party is a hard rocking, heavy sounding pummelling of the brain with some crazy man rumbling, mumbling ‘Esther’, whilst Fish propounds on ‘big’ things. It’s a song made entirely from the skin of dead Jim Morrisons. Mind Like A Playgroup is a perfectly reasonable philosophy, which features Danny Hopkins, of post-punk band Isolation, on rubber duck. Girlfriend is another perfectly crafted little pop song, with a tune that raises you up and drops you down. It’s moments of teenage love perfectly recounted.
	<p />
	<p />
Sex and Travel, their third album, continues in much the same vein, but with a sense of the songs being better constructed and more thought being put into the actual process of writing and recording. It’s a mesmerising mix of sophisti-pop and indie, with a dash of cynicism, weirdness, and a cutting sense of humour. The Human Jungle is sultry, clever pop. Big Saturday is a cross between Everything But The Girl and the Monochrome Set, with lush arrangement and production by John A. Rivers. The typewriter driven rhythm of Holiday recounts the adventures of an Englishman abroad, whilst Only A Rumour is a stunningly beautiful song about how to cope, or not, around other people after a break-up. Walk With The Devil has an excellent opening and build up, until you can almost feel the winter weather in your face and the coldness of your heart. A bitter, beautiful break-up song. The guitar line is as brutal and clear as the vocalist’s brush-off. The album ends with Down The Drain. It’s a quirky little number about drinking, which is funny, and then devastating.
	<p />
	<p />
The final album in this set is Distressed Gentlefolk. Here we find the Butcher producing more polished pop songs that pillage the decades to try and create an instant classic. It’s not quite that, but it’s still a forgotten beauty. It opens with the country rock of Falling In Love. Still In The Kitchen has a melancholic, psychedelic sound akin to the Velvet Underground. There’s the jaunty rockabilly of Hungarian Love Song, and the jazzy late night feel of The New World. Domestic Animals muses on those pets who don’t get sex in the spring like their wild cousins. Nothing Special is a lively pop song about doing nothing special. The album is closed by Angels, a melancholic song that sounds like the morning after the night before when something really bad happened.
	<p />
	<p />
The Jazz Butcher existed in that part of our lives which was always student digs, disappointing parties and long nights wondering about the meaning of it all with a wry, quirky sense of humour. The songs are full of nervous love affairs in elevators going nowhere and parties of the mind where everything slips into chaotic reality. They are a band well worth re-visiting or discovering for the first time. A release very much recommended.

	 It's odd now to think that I once thought of The Jazz Butcher as a Creation Records band. Well, they were a Creation Records band for a time but, having given a listen or two (or few dozen) to the new 4-CD box from Fire Records called The Wasted Years, I think it's safe to save that the earlier version of this band were far too iconoclastic and original to be pigeonholed by any easy label, um, label. The music here spans the band's first 4 records -- In Bath Of Bacon (1983), A Scandal in Bohemia (1984), Sex and Travel (1985), and Distressed Gentlefolk (1986) -- and the selections here routinely offer up to an even half-attentive casual listener some of the best UK indie one is likely to encounter from this era. For those of us who knew some of this, or lots of this, and were well-aware of front-man Pat Fish's skills and genius, this set is a gift that reaffirms all that, and serves as an easy way to re-acquaint ourselves with this band's very best material.
	<p />
	In Bath Of Bacon (1983) succeeds when it offers up music that largely doesn't give a fig about any trends of the era, like the throwaway "Love Kittens" or the fun "Sex Engine Thing", Fish crafting material that's witty, if not entirely well-considered (the regrettable "Chinatown", for instance). Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that some of this is indeed jazzy in a roundabout way ("Bigfoot Motel", for example). Still, there remain a few genuine nuggets here ("Zombie Love", or the aching "Party Time", perhaps).
	<p />
	Album number 2 from The Jazz Butcher is what some might argue, the first real Jazz Butcher record. A Scandal in Bohemia (1984) opens with the big, bright, witty pop of "Southern Mark Smith (Big Return)", a number that sees front-man Fish name-check band-mates Max Eider and David Jones (David J), 2 big factors into why this record is so good and essential. What pleases the ear still is the extent to which A Scandal in Bohemia (1984) reveals how well Fish and his crew were able to deliver such buoyant and lovely music without having a lot at their disposal. The light "Soul Happy Hour" sees Fish and his band serve up something that has echoes of both Brian Wilson and Roy Orbison in it, and yet which remains delightfully light of touch. Given a bigger budget, and a larger studio, one wonders what Fish could have made of the rollicking "Real Men", or the airy "Mind Like A Playgroup", for instance. Still, that's not to knock what's here but, rather, to highlight how much Pat Fish, Max Eider, and David J were able to deliver within the confines of early Eighties indie trappings.
	<p />
	Sex and Travel from 1985 is a superb record, and it's clearly the highlight of this Fire Records set. Opening with the lyrical "Big Saturday", the album serves up some of Pat Fish's best material. As he straddles territory that's both indie proper, and something a bit more adventurous, Fish seems to have finally found his style here, and so, The Jazz Butcher is a real band here, at least on this record. The spry "What's The Matter Boy?" nods in the direction of the band's earlier records but with far more success and confidence, while the pointed "President Reagan's Birthday Present" reflects the era's very real political concerns, as does "Red Pets" to some extent. And, as others have undoubtedly pointed out, "Holiday" seems Pat Fish's grab at the Ray Davies mantle, even if it sounds a bit like stuff from Robyn Hitchcock in the era.
	<p />
	If 1986's Distressed Gentlefolk was anything, it was likely the entry-point into The Jazz Butcher for a lot of Yanks, given the album's release via the BMG-associated Big Time label here in the States. "Big Bad Thing" sounds more robust and it's an indication that this record marked a turning point for the band. As Fish says on the band's official website, the band were drinking a lot at this time, making things a bit wobbly. And, sure there's a slight disconnect between the more routine indie of "Nothing Special" and the lovely and genuinely-jazzy "Who Loves You Now", for example. Still, there's a real breadth of material here and a listener shouldn't gripe too much about the leap from the gently-ramshackle "Domestic Animal" to the lush "Still in the Kitchen" when the difference in material indicates how in command Pat Fish remained in these years. The final record before the band's leap to Creation Records, Distressed Gentlefolk remains an odd collection of suitably odd indie-pop but there is, like elsewhere on The Wasted Years, a lot of heart and insight on offer here.
	<p />
	Perhaps wisely, the folks at Fire Records didn't attempt to compile the "best" Jazz Butcher cuts here on The Wasted Years. Rather, by serving up the first 4 albums, The Wasted Years serves, instead, as 41-track crash-course into one of the best, more underrated, and creative acts from those wilderness years between the first few waves of post-punk and the semi-renaissance of the C86 period and after. Wildly unlike anything else being cranked out in the early Eighties on either side of the Atlantic, the music of The Jazz Butcher was richly lyrical, decidedly melodic, and wholly fresh. And it remains so now, more than 3 decades later. One of the odd side-effects of the fact that The Jazz Butcher have been perpetually underrated is that, finally, they will get some real attention as The Wasted Years is a superb introduction into their music, as well as a remarkably and convenient way to get a lot of great music all at once.

	<p />“Don't you know they only make those pop records out of plastic?” Pat Fish asks on “Southern Mark Smith”, a signature early single from his band the Jazz Butcher. The implication is clear: Pop is disposable, and there is no need to take it so seriously and be so smug about it. Indeed, if the cliché about hurting the ones you love the most is true, Fish has an extra special fondness for pop. Over the course of the four albums and 41 tracks collected on <i>The Wasted Years</i>, he skewers pop in every which way - from the left, from the right, lyrically, musically, conceptually. And he shows his love by doing so with great care, meticulous wit, and, well, some great pop music. 	<p />
	<p />Fish (nee Patrick Huntrods) formed the Jazz Butcher in Oxford, England, in the midst of a post-punk indie scene that had become almost unbearably self-serious and was starting to be swallowed up by New Romantic synthpop. Fish essentially took the punk rock ideals of irreverence, scathing social commentary, and not necessarily being great at playing instruments, and carried them into the nascent world of guitar-led indie pop. In true punk spirit, he teamed up with a classically-trained, prodigiously-talented guitar player, Max Eider. Along with an unsettled cast that at one point included ex-Bauhaus and future Love & Rockets bassist David J, Fish and Eider went about making the Jazz Butcher the indie successor to the rowdy-but-sharp British pub rock of Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe, and the like. 	<p />
	<p />In the process, the Jazz Butcher became one of the most essential, continually interesting indie bands of the 1980s and beyond. They always seemed to be on the verge of completely falling apart, succumbing to drink, going broke, or some combination of the three. How they managed to continue and make some great music in the process was a mystery to them as well as anyone, and <i>The Wasted Years</i> doesn't try to solve it. Instead, it simply presents the band's first four albums, released one per year between 1983 and 1986 by the tiny Glass label. No bonus tracks, outtakes, live cuts, radio sessions, etc. But that is just as well because every facet of the nascent band is laid out scattershot-style on the albums proper.
	<p />A truly and modestly brilliant lyricist, Fish sings songs about all sorts of things, but mainly food, Russians, women, Russian women, and men. He's biting and cynical, but never mean-spirited and also very funny. In one of the early Butcher's signature tunes, “Party Time”, he turns ‘80s hedonism on its head, declaring it no more than “better than a cold bath with someone you dislike”. Before <i>The Wasted Years</I> are through, he has skewered macho men (“They play bad darts and drink bad beer”), stuffy British tourists (who “would never dare abuse the hospitality [they're] given”), even love itself (“It's like the bends for a diver, a back seat for the driver”). Yet Fish never comes across as a smug wiseass who thinks he's above it all. When he does talk about women and relationships, it's with the awkward self-doubt of a natural born wallflower. “Hey girl, please don't think me rude,” he says at one point, “I owe you some kind of gratitude; I don't know how these things are done.” 	<p />
	<p />Underneath the cunning and mirth is a melancholic, almost defeatist undercurrent, and it lends some of these songs a surprising beauty and gravitas. The debut, <i>Bath of Bacon</i>, goes too heavy on the silliness and novelty, aiming at such esoteric targets as the Normal's S&M-flavored underground hit “Warm Leatherette”. But starting from sophomore effort <i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i>, Fish and friends become more balanced and focused. On “President Reagan's Birthday Present”, Fish addresses Cold War tension: “A squad of Bolsheviks came flying through the air… they were communists and assholes,” he says, capturing the era's zeitgeist more succinctly than a hundred Simple Minds songs. But he also leaves room for sweet, jangly guitar pop like “Girlfriend” and “Only a Rumour”. By the end of fourth album <i>Distressed Gentlefolk</i>, “Angel” is tender and heartfelt enough to put one on the verge of tears. 	<p />
	<p />The music is, perhaps not surprisingly, all over the place, but never dull. There is acid garage rock, stomping Antmusic, dub reggae, Bavarian waltzing, and, of course, some jazzy numbers with cool, finessing solos from Eider. All in all, there is an airtight, five-star double-album to be culled from <i>The Wasted Years</i>, but compilation albums are already available, and the full-on Butcher experience is well worth the price of admission. The band would subsequently sign with Creation Records and release even better, more consistent material. Amidst temporary leaves of absence and side-projects, they remain a worthy concern and still perform live. With any luck <i>The Wasted Years</i> is the first salvo in a career appreciation that is long overdue.

Fire Records has the knack for exhuming the nan-nan of the 80's British pop. After TV Personalities, here is the tour of the Jazz Butcher. The first four recordings (In Bath Of Bacon, A Scandal In Bohemia, Sex And
Travel, Distressed Gentlefolk) are here recorded. The time (1983-86) when the big brown with a black Telecaster signed at Glass Records (with young shoots named Pastels, Spacemen 3 or Teenage Fanclub - not bad is not it?). We find all the talent of Pat Fish, between Velvet souvenirs, delusions on-realistic free, humor typically English jazzy fantasies, cabaret kink-hers ... And especially a few fucking songs! The fifth LP, Fishcotheque, is also a wonderful album. But this is another story. And another disc. [BL]

	Reissue of the first albums of one of the most underestimated groups of 80's and 90's English pop, The Jazz Butcher. For Magic, their charismatic leader Pat Fish remembers.
	<p />
	If a single record was missing in the anthology anthology of Indie Pop 1979- 1997, written by Jean-Marie Pottier in 2015 (The Word and the Rest), it would be In Bath of Bacon, the first album of the collective at absurd name The Jazz But-dear ("the butcher of jazz"). In Scandai in Bohemia (1984), Sex and Travel (1985) and Distressed Gentlefolk (1986) could have done just as well. The literature on one of the most endearing and underrated groups of his time struggles to designate an indisputable work. But from our point of view, it is In Bath of Bacon (1983) that carries in it all the diversity, the daring, the irony and the freshness of the shameless musicians by the singer and leader Pat Fish, Patrick Huntrods for the 'civil status.
	<p />
	Everyone will be able to make their opinion with the release of The Wasted Years, a box of four CDs that brings together these records, the first act of a rehabili-tation company that will unfold over two years. Fire Records began this work by publishing last year the thirteenth album of Jazz Butcher, the highly regarded Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, ending twelve years of silence.
	<p />
	"Wasted" is an adjective not easy to translate into French. "Spoiled", "wasted", even "screwed up" are his well-understood synonyms. "The ruined years", that sounds like a provocation to qualify the four years of association
	primitive between Pat Fish and guitarist Max Eider, seen in hindsight as the top of the band.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"These records are not our best, they are just the first," says Pat Fish. "For the rest, we were innocent young people suddenly thrown into a world of alcohol and drug free ... Of course we sank in the trap."
	</div>
	"Defeated": the other meaning of the word "wasted". This type of misunderstanding of the meaning of what is proposed characterizes Jazz Butcher's career at least as much as the class of his repertoire. His tremendous plasticity is also his weak point. He prevented the media and fans from clinging to a very unstable gang in his line-up and whose offer was particularly bushy, between damn songs and good bars of laughter. Carried by Fish's voice - as comfortable as a crooner and a rocker - the sound of Jazz Butcher leaps without notice from folk to punk, from jazz to pop, from joke to solemn ballad. The guitars doped with the echo of the 80s, Pat Fish's male-demonstrative timbre and the almost permanent second degree of its purpose serve as a unifying thread in a formidable aesthetic pataquès.
	<div class="iview_a">
	"In Britain, people have struggled to understand that having a good sense of humor does not make you a comedy band," laments Fish. "Listen to the American soul, listen to these Velvet Underground games: these people were doing sketches, perhaps, we had pondered the message from the London Calling Clash: it was possible to gracefully introduce elements of soul, reggae and old sounds into the punk storyline. "
	</div>
	The 41 titles of the box contain their dose of acoustic punk (Bigfoot Motel), pure rock n'roll imported from the 50s (I Need Meat), pop optimistic (Mind Like a Playgroup) and songs to drink (My Desert) . Even when it's cold, the pieces with the confusing modernity (Chinatown, Gray Flanelette), the ones worthy of Television (Zombie Love) or the Housemartins (Girlfriend) crash without having looked for it behind the prominence of the valves. "Born to be fried!" , shouted on Poisonded by Food with the melody of Steppen-wolf's Born to Be Wild anthem (1968) is just one example.
	<p />
	In this genre, nothing surpasses the haunting surrealist tale La Mer, taken up by the Little Rabbits in 1991. Sung in French in the text, located halfway between the children's song, the psychotropic journey and the irreverent homage to Trenet, she almost alone justified the reissue of one of the most beautiful follies produced by London in the 80s.

<div class="iview_intro">
As the project of Pat Fish, The Jazz Butcher has endured through myriad changes in the UK music scene. The outfit’s early output, namely debut <em>Bath of Bacon</em>, <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>, <em>Sex and Travel</em>, and <em>Distressed Gentlefolk</em>, offers endearing eccentricity and when absorbed chronologically, increasingly sharp songcraft. With the new reissue <em>The Wasted Years</em>, ordered listening is made easy, the set gathering these four albums, originally cut in ’83-’86 for the Glass label, onto four CDs and tucking them into a slim hardcover book with notes from Fish; it’s all assembled by Fire Records, who’ve become deft hands at assembling retrospectives of ’80s post-punk material.
</div>
<p />The Jazz Butcher has evolved quite a bit over the decades, but right from the beginning, sullen they were not. <em>In Bath of Bacon</em>, which dropped one of its prepositions at some point after its release in 1983, is infused with humor from the start, with “Gloop Jiving” a plunge into faux-cabaret finger-snap tomfoolery. Announcing himself as The Jazz Butcher and coming of like a highball-in-hand smoothie, guitar and sax help set the mood behind him.	
	<p />
It leads into an R&B revue styled theme song (think “Land of 1,000 Dances”) that’s somewhat anemic compared to its inspiration. But in large part due to guitarist Max Eider, there’s a musical sharpness that eventually shares the spotlight with said humor (due to the Brit nature of it all, that should be humour, I suppose), a circumstance further aided by Fish’s budding acumen as a songwriter; his strongest are “Playtime,” “Sex Engine Thing,” and “Zombie Love.”	
	<p />
Non-serious subject matter is often indicative of a lack of ambition, but not <em>Bath of Bacon</em>, which as it unwinds sorta connects like post-punk upstarts in an Orange Juice or Style Council mold striving to be the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band of their generation. The sheer range, from French pop imitations (“La Mer”) to pop exotica nods (“Chinatown”) to a Normal nick (“Grey Flannelette”) to an ode to young felines (“Love Kittens”) help counterbalance inconsistency as bold swipes of the Modern Lovers (in “Sex Engine Thing”) and Steppenwolf (in “Poisoned by Food”) reinforce the not-yet-pro nature of it all.	
	<p />
The gorgeously infectious guitar-pop of opener “Southern Mark Smith (Big Return)” makes immediately clear that <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em> was a major stride forward, a scenario only accentuated by a bigger studio and a solid backing band (including Eider, Owen Jones and notably, David J, formerly of Bauhaus), though Fish’s eccentric flourishes and genre hopping continue to formulate the distinctive approach that’s brought the Butcher persevering cult status.	
	<p />
However, the differing styles cohere much more effectively, with the pre-Beatle ’60s pop of “Soul Happy Hour” flowing into the neo-rockabilly of “I Need Meat,” which leads into the acoustic Eider highlight “Just Like Bettie Page.” Side two holds the art-funky “Marnie (Muscovite Mix),” the blast of punkish heaviness “Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present,” and an additionally fine slice of guitar pop in “Girlfriend.” Overall, humor is less of a defining trait, with the exceptions being “Mind Like a Playgroup” and more so closer “My Desert.”	
	<p />
Fish, or as he was credited on the back cover, Butch, hadn’t scaled back his observations, they just worked better as pop-rock lyrics, especially on the macho pub asshole takedown “Real Men,” and if still not at peak ability as a singer, he’s getting nearer. Horns are still occasionally in evidence, but the cocktail-jazz aura has dissipated, which is a nice turn of events moving forward.	
	<p />
<em>Sex and Travel</em> is variously listed as a mini-LP and a full album, but its eight songs total half an hour and deliver a full meal. If elements noticeably came together on <em>A Scandal in Bohemia</em>, here they gel completely, with some important adjustments, primary amongst them Fish graduating from sly joker to even sharper wit as his vocal talents bloom. Furthermore, the Butcher is no longer accurately assessed as genre-jumping, with the songs wide-ranging but unified.	
	<p />
It first side opens with consecutive pop gems in the decidedly indie poppish “Big Saturday” and the deftly Ray Davies-ish “Holiday,” tucks in the rollicking shout-along “Red Pets” and closes with a long dose of well-calibrated sophistication “Only a Rumour.” On the flip, “President Reagan’s Birthday Present” builds to a rousing conclusion, “What's the Matter, Boy?” lightens the mood, and “Walk with the Devil” takes a cinematic turn. “Down the Drain” might seem a slight bit of fun at first, but it delivers a satisfying conclusion.	
	<p />
It also spelled the end David J’s involvement, as he split for Love and Rockets. From there, the group recorded the live <em>Hamburg</em> and the “Hard” EP (neither included here) under the name The Jazz Butcher & the Sikkorskis from Hell, and then again adjusted the moniker to The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for the ’86 album <em>Distressed Gentlefolk</em>, which rounds out this set as it details Fish’s continued blossoming as a songwriter and vocalist.	
	<p />
And the range keeps widening. “Falling in Love” leans into country without faltering into trite mimicry, “Big Bad Thing” is a fun rocker halfway between Robyn Hitchcock and Dave Edmunds, “Still in the Kitchen” dices into ’80s pop-rock with slight hints of third album Velvets, and “Hungarian Love Song” is bouncy guitar-pop. Side one’s closer “The New World” brings back the jazz, this time via balladry triggering thoughts of smoldering ashtrays and two-drink minimums. It borders on the too-sophisto, but that seems deliberate; through Fish’s raised vocal game and Eider’s typically fine execution, it works.	
	<p />
Clean-toned Wes Montgomery-isms open side two, but even with a markedly jazzy piano solo from Max Steeds, “Who Loves You Now?” is an excursion into mainstream ’60s pop. The appealingly jangling “Domestic Animals” is a showcase for Fish’s non-diminished wit, but “Buffalo Shame” is a study in the overelaborate as it extends the cinematic, storytelling angle expressed on <em>Sex and Travel</em>’s “Walk with the Devil.”	
	<p />
Rebounding nicely is the organ-laced pop-rock of “Nothing Special” followed by another ballad in “Angel,” though even the inclusion of sax proves less jazzy as the matters get nearer to ’80s anthemics, ending the LP and <em>The Wasted Years</em> on a soaring note. <em>Distressed Gentlefolk</em> is described by Fire as an attempt to make the “greatest album ever,” and that’s apparent; it’s got too much sheen and a couple of iffy ideas, but is thankfully not strained. Pat Fish took The Jazz Butcher on to the Creation label and beyond with much success, but these albums are where it all started, and they shouldn’t be slept on.	<p />

Between 1983 and 1986, the Jazz Butcher were responsible for four albums' worth of confounding pop music, and The Wasted Years collects them all. Starting off as a solo vehicle for the offbeat musings of Pat Fish, with the addition of ace guitarist Max Eider and more friends (including David J. of Bauhaus), they grew into something interesting and strange. 1983's Bath of Bacon was the result of Fish's experiments with tape deck recording and it has lo-fi charm. Fish sounds like he's trying to figure out what the Jazz Butcher are exactly -- a wacky jazz band, a goofy pop group, or a cabaret experience -- while delivering a handful of wonderful songs, especially "Partytime," which features some skilled fretwork from Eider. By 1984's Scandal in Bohemia, the group had solidified and moved to a real studio to work with producer John Rivers. Not surprisingly, the sound is bigger and some of the weird edges are sawed down. In exchange for that, Fish turns in a bracingly hooky set of songs that the bands deliver with panache. Kicking off with "Just Like a Southern Mark Smith," which sounds like an actual radio hit, they then take a left turn into some tropical weirdness ("Real Men"), bebop rockabilly ("I Need Meat"), what sounds like a song from a European stage musical ("Marnie"), and acoustic children's folk ("Mind Like a Playgroup"). It's still a scattershot approach to making an album style-wise, but it sounds great thanks to the band's deft handling of the material and Fish's new level of craft and confidence. Their next album, 1985's Sex and Travel, came together in a week's time, and as a result, is the most focused album of their early days. The songs sound big and bright with huge drums, and the guitars have a widescreen jangle that fills the mix with warmth. "Big Saturday" is their poppiest moment yet, "Red Pets" works up an impressive head of steam, "Holiday" is a lovely oddball ballad complete with typewriter sounds, and the rest is delightfully fun, if a bit brief. It definitely showed the band becoming more assured and maybe even narrowing their focus a little in favor of a less wacky approach. 1986's Distressed Gentlefolk was the result. Their aim was to make the "Greatest Album Ever," and while they don't quite pull that off, it is their greatest album yet. It's a mix of big bad rockers ("Big Bad World"), country-rock road songs ("Falling in Love"), late-night jazz, and loads of their usual happy weirdness played with brio and sung by Fish like he's the cat who just caught the mouse. Add in a couple truly heartbreaking ballads -- "Still in the Kitchen" and "Angels" -- that show a surprising amount of emotional depth and it's a done deal. Fish went on to record more albums as the Jazz Butcher, but this is where it all began, and The Wasted Years is a fine collection of works by an overlooked and sometimes underestimated band.

At least on the surface, it may seem perverse to reissue music by an artist that noted that pop music was a disposable product.  But appreciation of art is a matter of emotions, not logic, so when The Wasted Years reached our ears, we felt like we hit the lottery.  The four CD collection (plus booklet) is assembled from four records -- Bath Of Bacon, A Scandal In Bohemia, Sex And Travel, and Distressed Gentlefolk -- by The Jazz Butcher.  The project, also known as the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy and other, similar, names, was founded in the late '70s by Oxford student Pat Fish (Patrick Huntrods).  Fish, often with a rotating cast of collaborators has been prolific over the years, creating music that reflects melody, wit, and an incredible genius for expressing pop music in just about every format possible.  Lo-fi indie pop? Of course. Soft rock with tones of jazz? Got it covered.  A bit of country? You don't need to ask.  Alternative folk?  Plenty of the best.  Rockabilly? Dance away! Oddball pop? See stage left. Cabaret?  Have a seat, your waiter will be along momentarily.
	<p />
	<p />
The four constituent records were released between 1983 and 1986 by Glass Records, a small outfit that also released records by the Pastels, Spaceman 3, and Teenage Fanclub. This is music constructed from pop components, with pop widely defined and the songs adventurously created with a punk attitude.  But don't assume that it was hastily made or carelessly performed.  The players are excellent, the arrangements detailed and the vocals layered.  The listener is treated to the cascading delights of 41 varied and invariably interesting songs running two and a half hours.  In our opinion,  The Wasted Years is disposable art that deserves to live forever.
	<p />
	<p />
The Wasted Years is out now as a four CD box set (plus booklet with an essay by Mr. Fish, himself) or digital download via Fire records.

	Sneaking into Austin's Liberty Lunch in 1990 was one of my high points during the twilight of my teen years. Being 18 years old and broke during my first year of college made an instant miscreant out of me. Regardless of my amoral decision, I was willing to be physically thrown out of a club and into jail to see The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (aka The Jazz Butcher).
	<p />
	Granted, sneaking into shows back in the day was much easier than it is now. But The Jazz Butcher helped me through high school, and I never thought that Pat Fish and company would ever tour Texas. When they came on, I instantly noticed how awful the sound man was messing with them, causing an oversaturation of feedback for a band that played clean notes on record. After all, I didn't come to see Spacemen 3.
	<p />
	Nostalgia is poisonous, however; yet, listening to The Wasted Years reminded me that freely and carelessly leaping into the past is necessary, even if there is no antidote for it.
	<p />
	Ironically pretentious, The Jazz Butcher reissue their first four albums in book form. In Bath of Bacon, A Scandal in Bohemia, Sex and Travel, and Distressed Gentlefolk are stark contrasts to the wave of the darkened sounds of the post-punk era. Imagine Ween's absurdist hilarity wrapped in The Fall's sound. Most of In Bath of Bacon, the band's first release, was recorded on Pat Fish's Amstead 7090, a "cheap and cheerful tool for those hell-bent in killing music through the medium of home taping." The songs still bite sharply into Thatcher's England like the Gang of Four with a sense of humor. "Sex Engine Thing" emasculates men who pride themselves on their delusional abilities to be pick-up artists. They also had a theme like the jazz music's swing era that fiercely brutalized jazz music improvisation called "Jazz Butcher Theme." The Jazz Butcher also openly mocked their contemporaries with tracks like "Grey Flannelette" and "Zombie Love." They stepped on throats with a cheeky smile and juvenalian satire.
	<p />
	David J, Bauhaus' bassist and "author of Bela Lugosi's Dead" joined the The Jazz Butcher after Bauhaus' demise, which permitted him to explore a less theatrical approach to playing music with Pat Fish and Max Eider. Bauhaus were the ultimate pomp and pretentiousness The Jazz Butcher weren't, and David J's addition made A Scandal in Bohemia work. David J already performed using a fretless electric bass, so songs like "Real Men" and "Just Like Betty Page" made the band's weird aesthetic tight. The rhythm section kept their angular riffs from falling apart.
	<p />
	It is rare to say this about a reissue, but the textual history provided by Fish makes this a must-have for any fan of The Jazz Butcher. Not to mention that Brian Pyles' remastered tracks permit fans to listen again to these great records without noticing a pristine cleansing of them. Their history isn't a tumultuous one. Fish's dry wit is felt throughout the retrospective like many of his songs' lyrics. As Fish pointedly states, after 1986, "The balance was never quite right after David left." David J went on to form Love and Rockets and their big hit, "So Alive," diminished any possibility of him returning to The Jazz Butcher in the immediate future.
	<p />
	Beyond any real comparison, The Jazz Butcher were an incomparable genre-bending act that requires a substantive re-evaluation. Between the pages and the artwork of this reissue lies a time capsule of a time that is just as pertinent today as the time when it was created.

	Christmas is coming and here is one of the first beautiful gifts to be made: the reissue of the first four albums of the Jazz Butcher in an impeccable box is the opportunity to dive back into this divine period of the years 1983-86 when the English pop to his zenith digested for a few months punk, post-punk and all the history of rock to re-breathe into eternal and catchy melodies, cultured songs and intelligent, referenced and sparkling. At the heart of this period, of course, was The Smiths, the ultimate quartet, and largest band of the time, from most eras to tell the truth. And then there were others like the Jazz Butcher led by its leader to do everything Pat Fish, a young intellectual, Oxford student, lover of Pynchon and SF, Velvet Underground and black humor. Pat Fish originates, for those interested in such details, from Northampton, the beating heart of England according to Alan Moore (who does not speak about it in his monumental Jerusalem). Pat Fish is a buddy with Max Eider playing the guitar. The two men share, as every time, their desire to fight and give birth quickly (it is in 1983) a first album for the label Glass Records. It will be Bath of Bacon, literally a Ham Bath.
	<p />
	The album is a strange, funny and completely unrestrained thing, a surreal album and carried by a jazz spirit turned towards the night, drunkenness and the loss of landmarks. Bath of Bacon feels endless evenings, girls, alcohol, drugs. It feels like a student party or a club in St. Germain in the 60s. Pat Fish speaks to us directly before embarking on a wild rock and then to poke some beautiful songs. There are nuggets on this album like Party Time, a stripped song that gives a good idea of ​​the songwriter talents of the man and the ease with which Pat Fish composes at the time. The sequence of couplets, musical bridges and melodic ease are already breathtaking. The Jazz Butcher does what he wants. He plays the old-school rock band on Bigfoot Motel, crosses the Atlantic on a wink, becomes punk on Sex Engine Thing before touching the sublime on the incredible Zombie Love. The album ends (or almost) with a song in French, La Mer, which will be worth to the group to attract a little attention in the Hexagon. La Mer evokes Tati and Trenet, it is an endearing oddity and testifies to the complete absence of aesthetic limits of the group and Pat Fish in particular. As long as there is audacity, there is class. This is the moral of the story.
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher continues on his second album and our favorite, A Scandal in Bohemia, receiving in reinforcement David J, defector of Bauhaus .... The guy consolidates the original group and makes this album a near-total success. From the impeccable Southern Mark Smith (a tribute to The Fall, of course, and his tribal leader) to the rockabilly of Soul Happy Hour or I Need Meat, to the emotion of Just Like Betty Page, or the cross- overdue between Syd Barrett and ... Lou Reed proposed by the unfathomable Mind Like A Playgroup, The Jazz Butcher offers a mix of genres and influences of incredible originality. The band sparkles with ideas and puts them all in application which gives a whole teeming between rock, pop and psychedelism. There are standards here like the unsurpassed Girlfriend, a title that deserved to be an instant hit, talking about girlfriends and love. A Scandal in Bohemia, and the group in general, will suffer from their overflowing talent. The group is reproached for dispersing itself while its genius is precisely to amuse itself at all costs and to leap, without looking twice, into titles that would make the ordinary of any mediocre group. Hard to say if the whole lack of coherence but it is certain that player as it is, Pat Fish is overwhelmed everywhere by groups that seem in the eyes of people (listeners and critics) as more concentrated, serious and determined.
	<p />
	Sex and Travel, their third album, does not say much more than Scandal In Bohemia but does it even better. A little more indie rock and less American than the previous one, the album makes the bet of intelligence and subtlety. Fish gets tired and becomes somewhat cynical. He probably knows at that time that the group will be confined to a modest fame. Nevertheless, he played the pop game of the time, surprisingly making amazing pop titles of balance and grace. Big Saturday is simply beautiful, sinking all the pop efforts of the time. Pat Fish is in a state of grace. There are not many people to compete: the melodies are unstoppable, just beautiful, and the texts of a high quality combining Englishness (Holiday hilariously tells the adventures of an Englishman who goes on holiday abroad ), nostalgia for adolescence and disembodied romances. The Jazz Butcher sometimes looks like a Divine Comedy deprived of its strings: romantic and out of the box. The song of Pat Fish is willingly changed into storyteller. The songs describe significant scenes, charming moments, details of the story. The group maintains throughout its discography a pronounced American tropism that will work for fans of exclusive English pop. It is in these bounding and energetic roots that the Jazz Butcher draws its spring: a little blues and very rock. We can not understand the temporal beauty of Only A Rumor, the most beautiful song on the album, without appreciating the wandering Red Pets that precedes. The Jazz Butcher is an impure band and the rest on each of his records, while The Smiths who are also fed to American rock will succeed in burying this influence in the balance of forces that is established between Morrissey and Marr.
	<p />
	The box closes on Distressed Gentlefolk, an album that has long been misrepresented as the band's major achievement. For the first time, Pat Fish manages to discipline herself and focus from end to end to craft neat and impeccably produced songs. The model is openly the Velvet Underground, in a mid-rock, mid-country version. Suddenly, one gets bored a little at times to the point of regretting the madness of the first times. The album is melancholic, applied, virtuoso often, testifying once again to the ease of Fish and his stooges. It's hard to really get excited about Falling In Love and its archetypal designs. The album has sometimes taken a shot of old but still works remarkably well on his succession of titles punches (Big Bad Thing) and moving moments. We love the ugly and neo-realistic sadness of Still In The Kitchen, but clearly less anachronistic stuff like Hungarian Love Song. The album is light-as-air with songs like Doowop from Who Loves You Now, sad and gently regressive, or the hilarious Domestic Pets, a piece that evokes the sex life of pets. All this is obviously not very serious while being infinitely so. The Jazz Butcher remains a curiosity of history all along. How can a guy who writes Nothing Special, a piece of unmatched elegance, be at the pinnacle of his discipline? It will remain a mystery and a great injustice.
	<p />
	The epic of the Jazz Butcher, which continues for the curious on a dozen albums after those, is one of the most endearing in the history of English rock. The group spends a long time at Creation, before Eider and Fish drown in alcohol and decide to separate for good. Fish recomposes a Butcher with new members and makes the sauce last, in concerts and in the studio, until the mid-90s. After that, he puts an end to the adventure and reinvents himself through Sumosonic, which will not make long fire, and for some years, with Wilson, a group even more discreet and obscure but which counts in its repertoire ... the best songs of the world. Fish celebrated his 60th birthday this year.
	<p />
	The fate of Pat Fish shows that not everyone has succeeded but that there are careers more discreet, less linear (and directed to the top) than others that are just as good. The music of the Jazz Butcher has the flavor of early rock, early emotions, teens hugs and first glasses. It is a music of human warmth, of exaltation, a music that goes from laughter to tears, from the muddy joke to the philosophical projection, from the religious pamphlet to the psychedelic intoxication. It takes a lot of talent to go from cock to donkey and conspire thirty years at this level of excellence.

<b>A new box set, collecting four albums released between 1983 and 1986, is a fascinating look at the early stages of an underrated UK post-punk act.</b>
	<p />
Glass Records, the London-based label created in 1981 by musician Dave Barker, was home to an unusually motley collection of pop and rock acts. Some were castaways from defunct bands (David J. of goth originators Bauhaus and Nikki Sudden of cheeky experimentalists Swell Maps signed to the imprint after their respective projects crumbled in the early ’80s), others were new artists like synthpop outfit In Embrace and the psychedelic preachers Spacemen 3. No one artist sounded much like the rest of the roster; what seemed to connect them was a cavalier indifference to their potential commercial prospects.

	<p />
No artist in the Glass stable exemplified this spirit better than the Jazz Butcher, a project led by Pat Fish (real name: Patrick Huntrods), a singer/songwriter from Northampton, England, who, at the time, was cobbling together lo-fi demos in his bedroom using a cheap tape deck. The band signed to Glass in 1982 and went on to release a quartet of albums and a smattering of singles that experimented freely with dubby pop, jazzy rambles sung in French, tumbledown rockabilly, and fuzzed-out rock.

	<p />
That stylistic range fit well within the electrifying, unsettled post-punk aesthetic of the time, but somehow the Jazz Butcher hasn’t been canonized in the manner of many of its contemporaries. That could change with the reissue campaign that Fire Records recently launched, starting with The Wasted Years, a multi-disc set compiling the group’s first four LPs for Glass. Shaggy and often uneven as the records are, together they provide a fascinating spotlight on how Fish’s songwriting evolved from spirited insouciance into mature introspection.

	<p />
The Jazz Butcher’s progression was steep and fast. Separated by only four years, the albums that bookend this collection‚ 1983’s In Bath of Bacon and 1986’s Distressed Gentlefolk‚ share plenty of the same DNA, but feel miles apart. On the debut, Fish has yet to shake off the sensibilities of the bedroom demos that got him a record deal. “It’s really just the sound of a few mates failing to take seriously the fact that they’ve got an LP to make,” he has said. That’s a little dismissive to the music he was making at the time, an appealing jangle-pop minimalism akin to Tracey Thorn’s early band Marine Girls, with small spurts of virtuosity from guitarists Max Eider and M.K. Daley. But Fish’s comment does jibe with his boyish lyrical concerns on Bacon, which include food poisoning, a hotel for sasquatches (“Bigfoot see a neon sign/Bigfoot reach for his credit card”), and “Girls Who Keep Goldfish.”

	<p />
Those interests stay pretty much the same on the follow-up, 1984’s A Scandal in Bohemia—it’s the music that improves markedly. By this point, the Jazz Butcher was a full-fledged band, with Fish and Eider joined by David J. on bass and drummer Owen Jones. These seasoned musicians, and the guiding presence of producer John A. Rivers, give the music a new verve on the wobbly sea-shanty folk of “My Desert” and the winking garage-rocker “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present.”

	<p />
The Jazz Butcher’s final two releases on Glass set the stage for the rest of Fish’s career to date. The wonderful 1985 mini-LP Sex and Travel retains a loose, playful approach to guitar pop, while Fish’s lyrics become more focused and sharp, whether exploring his romantic troubles as heard on “Only a Rumour” and the bitter “Walk With the Devil,” or the insanity of the Cold War (“President Reagan’s Birthday Present”).

	<p />
Gentlefolk completes his transformation into a fully-formed songwriter. Credited to the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (with like-minded friend of the band Felix Ray replacing David J), the record boasts some of Fish’s finest material: “Still in the Kitchen” is a devastating glimpse into a depressive mind (“Be lonely/You’re already all alone anyway”), while the smoldering “Angels” balances the agony of heartbreak with gratitude at the support of his loved ones. Fish diminishes the impact a bit by mixing in Jonathan Richman-like goofs like “Domestic Animal” and “Big Bad Thing,” but even those moments are presented with wit and a welcoming smile.

	<p />
In the years that followed, Fish would only get better. He would soon leave Glass for Creation Records, a label with far more clout and the money to support his creative growth. Their relationship resulted in some of his most commercially-successful efforts—his 1988 cover of the ’60s pop classic “Spooky” gave him his best-ever position in the UK indie charts—and a crystallizing of his persona as a sensitive freak who pours his heart out to a female companion with the same fervor that he imagines, say, contracting the bubonic plague. (The high point: 1993’s Waiting for the Love Bus is a frothy delight, with Fish at his most lovestruck and giddy.)

	<p />
The Wasted Years, despite its sardonic title, is a worthwhile look back at the path he took to get to those heights. While it’s not a complete document of the band’s start—this set ignores standalone singles and b-sides from this era, like a rollicking cover of the Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner”—it sets the table for a three-decade-plus journey that continues to surprise, confound, and satisfy.

Nonsense The Jazz Butcher is truly unique group.
<p />
They claim to be punk, because they do what they want to. Some songs from Bloody Nonsense seem to support this claim. “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present” is combine grinding guitars with equally harsh vocals. The lyrics are strange: “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present” “was made entirely from the skins of dead Jim Morrisons . . .” “Drink” is a Beatles-sounding tune which extols the enjoyment of imbibing. Vocalist Max Eider proclaims to all: “I hope 1 never get dry before I get old.” “Partytime” and “The Devil is my Friend” are two other ‘party songs’ on the album. President Reagan’s Birthday Present” and “Jazz Butcher-V-Prime Minister” demonstrate that The Jazz Butcher do something besides getting drunk. Other songs like “The Human Jungle” and “Big Saturday” show the band has vocal maturity. These songs sound like The Smiths meet The Dream Academy. Finally, the album portrays the group’s songwriting lunacy. “Death Dentist” and “Grooving in the Bus Lane” are two strange ones. This album may sound really awful. Actually. this album is great for anyone with a sense of humour who appreciates ‘unique’ music.

A marvelous thing, the English language. A root word, get this, created solely for a British pop musician named Pat Fish, singer, songwriter and co-guitarist of Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (as they will henceforth be known).
<p />
Wow. Gestural, articulate, and insightful are good, too. What's in a name?
<p />
“Indeed. It's only a name, like Pat Fish is only a name." The conspiracy arises from the creative collaboration that is “more than just the four people on stage." Through a “convoluted series of accidents, including a brief association with David j (ex Bauhaus, now in Love & Rockets), the final line-up includes Max (guitar), Mr. Jones (drums) Felix (bass).
<p />
“We are fully aware of the absurdity of all this"
<p />
Several years back, Pat promptly shed his academic skin after realizing, “I was living out other people's ambitions rather than my own." Studying Aristotle and Kant at Oxford U was “a real waste of time," and, getting together with David J in '83, the other man about Northhamptonshire (“it was a little ridiculous: we were wearing the same clothes, liked the same music, read the same books, even the obscure ones"), they set out to make some music and “have fun doing it." Another rock band is born. But this time, it's a bunch of cracked philosophers who wrestle with the morality of suicide and other Big Questions — the existential crisis encapsulated in a three minute pop song.
<p />
“I don't trust people with beards."
<p />
But Tom Waits only has a scruff so he's okay, as are the Weather Prophets, the Pogues, and the Jesus And Mary Chain. Although his pals The Woodentops are “a bit smoother than they ought to be," Pat concedes, “fair enough, they want to make some money." The heart's still mending, though, from the shock he got from
the pages of Interview: “I'm thinking, yeah, it's true; all Andy Warhol cares about is making money. I turn the page and there's Louis Reed on his stupid little beachbox thing." Exit personal God.
<p />
But their fantastic pop song, 'Human Jungle,' with its 'Walk on the Wild Side' bass line, a go-go lyric (“I know all about your house, I know all about your mouth") and marzipan cool is pure Lou. The Velvets are the thing. They're cute beyond belief, so sweet."
<p />
“We're not quite the ones for the 'plug the product' department"
<p />
No, they aren't, so the honors are mine. Their first domestic release, the juicy, quirky Bloody Nonsense is a compilation of three British albums— a situation that Pat finds embarrassing. “British fans ask, 'what are they putting out this crap for again?' And I sympathize:" Their next album, recorded several months ago, will be released in October. Called Distressed Gentle Folk , the cover art is Pat's collage of solitary icons such as Judy Garland, Brian Wilson, Albert Camus, Franz Kafka. “There are also some animals, like a cat in some kind of test machine— it's obviously not going to come out of it alive."
<p />
It's unnerving: the punk ethos (“we do what we want") meets Aztec Camera pop sensibility and out-intellectualizes Lloyd Cole on the way. Forget Leonard Cohen, it's the twisted brilliance of Hunter S. Thompson.
<p />
Pat's taking a breather (how normally can you breathe with a record company rep. on one side and Mike Dyer's power winder on the other?). They'll be taking on the “biblethumping fundamentalists who burn pop records" (ie, Americans) this month, playing in venues of “small bits of cardboard and toothpicks."
<p />
Godsend and godspeed. Look no further, as Pat insists, “the flesh and blood is all there is." Bloodsuckers, Imagemakers, step aside, because the conspiracy is coming to town.

From the fine folks at Relativity comes an album that has the wealthy potential to restore any faith you may have lost in the current state of British rock. Fishcoteque by The Jazz Butcher is just the remedy for those who have a tenacious craving for ringing harmonies and good, tight guitar pop.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher (a.k.a. Pat Fish) is one of the most versatile artists currently writing and recording out of the doldrums of Great Britain. On prior efforts, his music has tended to drift aimlessly into the realms of pseudo-jazz and '60s soul, but on Fishcoteque the Butcher zeros in on easy, folky tunes and dirty pop that owes just a small passing nod to Lou and the Velvets. Fish’s sleek melodicism emerges on the brilliant “Next Move Sideways,” "Get it Wrong," and the moving portrait, "Susie.” The thrash of “Chickentown" and "Looking for Lot 49” counterbalances the overall gentle tone of
the record.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher dishes out no great promises of hope nor does he hold any lofty goals for stardom (he formed The Jazz Butcher while drunk one evening). Nonetheless, lack of professional aspiration and publicity doesn’t make the results of Fishcotaque any less essential.

How good can an album be if it is recorded by a man who calls himself “The Jazz Butcher?” In his latest album, “Fishcotheque,” he has the right idea with his style of music, presenting a laid-back brand of funky pop. But his vocals are wrong for some of the songs.
<p />
For the most part, the music is good instrumentally. However, on the slower tracks The Jazz Butcher is out of key and grates on your ears.
<p />
The best song on “Fishcoteque” is “Next Move Sideways.” The horn section and
saxophone by Alex Green create a light jazzy feel in this song and in the other faster tracks from the album, such as “Chickentown” and “Living in a Village.” Although The Jazz Butcher seems to be a weak singer, the upbeat music helps carry the songs.
<p />
Though the band’s sound hasn’t matured yet, it has the talent to develop into sophisticated pop. The instrumentation, for example, has polish and style i in songs like “Next Move Sideways.” The band should try to carry this sound all the way though the album, but they don’t. Instead they go off on tangents and experiment with styles that
don’t work for them.
<p />
One example is “The Best Way,” in which the band tries to sing/ rap their way through the song, like the Clash did in “Magnificent Seven” on the album “Sandinista.” While “Magnificent Seven” is a terrific song, “The Best Way” flops, because the band just wasn’t meant to rap. In addition, they’ re rapping horrendous lyrics, the main body of which is the phrase, “Which came first, the chicken or the egg?”
<p />
Another thing The Jazz Butcher can’t sing is ballads. On the faster tracks, the tempo can hold him up. However, on slow songs like “Swell” and “Susie,” his voice is laid bare, and he is annoyingly out of tune.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher isn’t terrible. He and his band have the potential to excel in their own area--fast, jazzy pop. They should stay away from areas where they are weak, namely ballads and especially rap.
<p />
It’s good for bands to explore new styles of music, but if something doesn’t work, they should know enough to avoid it. The Jazz Butcher didn’t, so “Fishcoteque” is a disjointed album without a definitive style. However, it certainly does have its moments.

	From outside, The Old White Horse seems a normal, adequately spacious pub deep in the heart of Brixton, but inside the "Steam Heat Room" an intimate, often private, though always worthwhile display of audio idiosyncrities peers through a shrouded veneer of normalality.
	
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher kick off with a not quite perfect "Summertime", keyboards intruding on an out of tune vocal that last all night and probably as long as they exist.  Soon though they charm us with their Northampton wit and sub velvets (sub felt even) sounds, though nowhere near as angst ridden, decidedly tongue in cheek in fact as shown in "Partytime", (dedicated to "all the rockers") during which balloons fell from somewhere, making the whole thing swing.
	
	<p />
	Later they play "My Favourite Things", brilliantly punctuated by a sax which carries the set, while the initially intrusive keyboard adds a thin, sublime texture veering towards the atmospheric doodlings of very eary Passage.
	
	<p />
	Their own songs range from the nonsense of "Kittens", complete with wonderfully apt harmonies, to the frenetics to their closing song from which they presumably draw their name.
	
	<p />
	The Jazz Butcher themselves are never frantic though, seated relaxed about the gloom, almost casually transfixed by their nonetheless tight and committed music; And with names like Princess Alice (keyboards and occasional continental chanteuring), Mad Max (clipped guitar), they are undoubtedly hepcats, although a single on Glass belies and puritan ethics as they glide shakily through a justly rewarding set.  And anyway, jazz with a drum machine? - the purists should be shaken.

		<h4>Last autumn, Pat Fish and Tim Keegan performed, separately then together for a warm encore, in front of a few dozen people in Malakoff (Hauts-de-Seine). A few hours earlier, we had interviewed the former in the company of the latter, who has known him for a long time. As is often the case with the Jazz Butcher in chief, the conversation went a bit all over the place, rich in anecdotes and tasty memories. Just like his music, in fact.</h4>
<p /><b>Although you have loyal fans in France, you rarely come to play there. Why is that?</b><br />
<strong>Pat Fish :</strong> Because nobody asks me ! (laughs) "Just...". (in French) We played a few concerts in the Bordeaux region, I think in 2015, but it's been a long time since we've played in Paris. The last time we played in Paris was at the Arapaho, but I hear the venue no longer exists. At the time, I thought this place probably wouldn't last much longer... (laughs) I remember seeing Alan Vega there one night. It was strange because on stage he was very aggressive, threatening the audience (he imitated him). And after the concert, we went to see him in his dressing room and he was very nice : " Oh, hi... How are you, it's so good to see you, man ". The change was incredible. I mean, it was better tonight in that sense than in the other!	
	<p />

<strong>Eight of your old albums were recently <a href="https://www.firerecords.com/the-jazz-butcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-released by the Fire label</a>, on vinyl and in the form of two CD boxes: "The Wasted Years" for the Glass period (1983-86) and "The Violent Years" for the Creation period (1988-1991). Whose idea was it?</strong>
	<p />
The Fire people came to me, through a friend who works with them. They offered me money for the Jazz Butcher back catalogue and I accepted by telling them to do whatever they wanted with it. I'm satisfied with the boxes, they did a good job. For the first one, I told them that I would write the text of the booklet myself. And then I found myself faced with a real problem. Because the first Jazz Butcher album, and therefore the first one that the owners of this anthology were going to listen to, was "Bath of Bacon". I was putting myself in the shoes of a twenty or twenty-five year old music critic who was supposed to write a review. And when he found out about it, he'd probably think, "Why the fuck did they put that shit in the box?" (laughs) So I had a kind of blockage and it took me six months to write these notes... because I couldn't see how to explain "Bath of Bacon". I ended up working out this outrageous theory that it's a DJ record. If sampling had existed at the time, it would have been a lot easier to do! Because basically it's just a collection of musical ideas taken from elsewhere. A bit of petty larceny. In the space of ten minutes I even thought about doing it again with a sampler. Before I thought it would be a waste of time! The intro of "Girls Who Keep Goldfish", for example, is "I'm Set Free" from the Velvet Underground. We were expecting lawyers from New York. Well, actually, 104 years later, nobody noticed. (chuckles)

	<p />
<strong>Are there any plans to bring out the other Jazz Butcher records: singles, live albums, those released after 1991?</strong>
	<p />
I'd like to, but there are problems, especially with Illuminate (1995). At the time, Sony was involved and I don't know if Fire is powerful enough to get the rights back. But if not, a third box set is almost finished. It will gather the A and B sides of the singles, some obscure tracks and, on the fourth CD, a radio session recorded in Santa Monica. The story is hilarious. We had been touring California for eight weeks, we were driving around, and at one point our tour manager says, "Ah, by the way, you're playing live on the radio in Los Angeles tonight". It was supposed to be a live broadcast. We said we'd only play two songs... and we ended up doing thirteen! (he bursts out laughing) And everybody was delighted with the result. I'm really happy that we can finally release this recording. As far as the rare tracks, the B-sides, pffff... " It's no big deal. "(in French) So it's good to have this radio session to make the whole thing richer.

<strong>You have always been the only permanent member of the group, so much so that today he is confused with you. Did you think from the beginning that it would be like that?</strong>
	<p />
When you start, you don't ask yourself that much. You play with other people, it makes a band. Maybe two years later, you understand that you need a more solid training, with other musicians, it lasts another two or three years. And then, you realise that for it to work, you need people who are free and who want to do it. You have to avoid situations where a member of the team doesn't want to play... I had a good band a few years ago, with whom I played concerts, but it evaporated. The trumpet player, who is also a good painter and a very nice guy, lives in Sicily now...	
	<p />
<strong>Tim Keegan: Your last album to date, the very successful "Last of the Gentleman Adventurers", benefited from the presence of guitarist Max Eider, who was a member of the band from 1982 to 1986 and again from 1995. But after two concerts, he left. That must have been a difficult moment?</strong>
	<p />
It was weird, for sure. It was a beautiful day, we'd met up at the venue where we were supposed to perform in the evening, and there, looking sinister, he told me he was stopping the stage for health reasons, that he thought he'd died the day before when his heart had gone mad, in Brixton... despite the fact that he'd been very good despite his condition! Having said that, I'm sure he'll play on the next record. Maybe not on the whole, like on "Gentleman Adventurers", but at least on a few tracks.

<strong>Compared to other bands from the 80's and 90's, some of which have made a comeback in the last few years, The Jazz Butcher is harder to categorize because of the variety of your inspiration. Do you think it could have been an obstacle to a greater success?</strong>
	<p />
I think my songs, because they are rather immediate, were not always well understood. The ones that people generally considered as fantasy are rather melancholic, dark. Take "Love Kittens" on "Bath of Bacon", for example. It's about a man who has become so disenchanted with life that kittens are all he wants to think about. It's pathetic... I played the song at a party at a friend's house, he filmed it and put it on the Internet with this comment : "The darkest song ever written" ! (see below) I was glad he understood. So these songs may sound a bit silly, but they show how some people can end up. The idea is not to make fun of fools. I was very much influenced by Syd Barrett, who I never considered as a madman... Frankly, I can understand someone who's tired of sitting for hours in a badly heated van, to go and play in some backwater town where the audience is going to throw bottles at you. Then coming home in the freezing cold, listening to Roger Waters talk about his career plans. That's not crazy. (smiles)

	<p />
<strong>You were talking about your first album as a mix of influences. What kind of music were you listening to when you started writing songs yourself?</strong>
	<p />
I wanted our music to be unclassifiable, and one of the reasons for that was "London Calling" by The Clash. Because with this record, they were freeing themselves from their own straitjacket. Once they had Topper Headon with them, they could play whatever they wanted. It was a real liberation for me too. Another band that I listened to a lot in the early 80s was the Fun Boy Three, I loved their lyrics. They were writing songs about something, which was pretty rare at the time... Otherwise, I've always been a fan of soul music, and I think you can hear it on "Bath of Bacon", this way of singing screaming like I'm from Memphis... And then the Velvet, of course. But I soon got tired of clichés about them: "Ah, the Velvet Underground... Sadomasochism, heroin, street violence..." You're joking! When I cover one of their songs, I feel like Uncle Lou is behind me, putting his hand on my shoulder and saying calmly: "yeah, it's OK"... (Tim agrees: "Big softee, Uncle Lou. He used to pretend a lot.") What amuses me about Lou Reed is that he used to scare the journalists. Even when he was funny and charming, they were still afraid of him, and thought he had spoken badly to them! The funniest interview with him I've ever seen was in South Africa or Australia, a place like that, facing a young MTV type journalist. The guy asks him if he's happy to be in the country in question, and Lou just answers "no". "Mr. Reed, are you happy to be on TV? - No." He's taken aback, he asks him again, and Lou looks at him and says, "Have you seen what's on TV? " (laughs)

	<p />
<strong>The liner notes for "Last of the Gentleman Adventurers" were signed by comic book author and writer Alan Moore. Are you neighbours in Northampton?</strong>
	<p />
Yes, he doesn't live very far from me, and we've been friends since the '80s. He's the author of the comic books "Watchmen" and "V for Vendetta", amongst others. And recently he published a huge novel, "Jerusalem", one chapter of which is a very elaborate parody of James Joyce. Well, actually, the idea of the book is that Northampton is the centre of the universe, because Alan Moore lives there. (laughs) It's a strange little town, but I love it. It's very difficult to describe it, actually... The easiest way would be to quote the lyrics of one of my new songs : "I live in a town where people say no". And that's what I like about the people of Northampton: when there's something they don't want to do, like a rotten job, they just refuse. It takes thirty years before they deign to talk to you. But it's worth it!	
	<p />
<strong>Tim Keegan: I think it's like that all over England!</strong>
	<p />
It's even more pronounced when you go up north. And a sense of humour can be really special. I remember a little incident a few years ago when the reformed Woodentops came to play at a club in Northampton. After the concert, I was outside smoking with them and some of the Jazz Butcher members. The Woodies' keyboard player was new to the band, you could tell that she was nervous and was looking for others' approval of her performance. My friend Ian and I were just explaining to her the local sense of humor, which Rolo [Woodentops leader and early Jazz Butcher] understands very well. People are really awful to each other, but it's funny," etc. "It's a lot of fun," he says. She listened to us carefully. And at one point, Ian says, "Oh, by the way, you were shit tonight, by the way". A perfect illustration of what we'd just explained to her... She burst into tears.

	<p />
<strong>How are your days in Northampton? Do you write songs?</strong>
	<p />
I do... I play a bit of music every day, anyway. Lots of social interaction... smoking, drinking... And I take care of my cat, Raoul [to whom he dedicated a song]. He's the boss, I have to obey him. I open the door for him when he knocks, yes he does!	
	<p />
<strong>Are you still in contact with Alan McGee, the founder of the label Creation? He still seems to be a big fan of your music.</strong>
	<p />
We don't see each other very often and we don't communicate a lot, except for computers. He's due to come to Northampton soon for his lecture tour where he's basically talking about being Alan McGee... I think I'm going to go there so I can shout at him : "Get off the stage ! "(Laughs) Last time he was in town he was DJing at a local band party. When the last show was over, almost everyone left, so it was supposed to be just a dozen people. And Alan continued to play records as if his life depended on it! He was really into it. I think the ten people who were still there knew him personally. He remained a real music lover. I saw that a biopic was being filmed about him, I don't know what it's going to look like.	
	<p />

	<p />
<strong>You played the saxophone when you were younger. Is that an instrument you're still fond of?</strong>
	<p />
Yes, and Jazz Butcher had a saxophonist, Alex Green, for a long time, but he hasn't played for years. I remember an interview - I still have the tape, strangely enough - in which he said, with a very penetrating air: "Of course, at the very beginning of humanity, we communicated by blowing a horn. That's what came first. "And the last time I saw him, he told me he'd thrown away his saxophone! It's obviously not as important to him anymore. He'd come to see me at my house, unannounced, we'd talked. I asked him what he was doing now, and he told me he was working for the Barclays Bank in Jersey. He started explaining to me all the shady things he was doing with Iran, things like that, and he told me that it was obviously just between us. And the next day, I go to buy the newspaper, and I read "Barclays bank in Jersey, completely corrupt: 10 page special"! He's probably in jail today. (laughs)	
	<p />
<strong>A few years ago, a new album was announced, "The Highest in the Land". What about it?</strong>
	<p />
It should be released, on the Glass label which was re-launched under the name Glass Modern. They have already released a track from Future Pilot AKA with Robert Wyatt on vocals. I like the idea of going back to my old label even though I have a very good relationship with Fire records. Right now I'm at the demo stage, I must have 60 or 70% of the songs. Sometimes it's towards the end of the recording of an album that a new one emerges, almost unconsciously. That was the case with "La Mer" on the first album. I spent the whole afternoon on it without being satisfied. All of a sudden, I had the idea of writing a French lyric, and it worked. Often, the fact of being limited in time stimulates the imagination.

		<h4>L’automne dernier, Pat Fish et Tim Keegan se produisaient, séparément puis ensemble pour un chaleureux rappel, devant quelques dizaines de personnes à Malakoff (Hauts-de-Seine). Quelques heures plus tôt, nous avions interviewé le premier en compagnie du second, qui le connaît depuis longtemps. Comme souvent avec le Jazz Butcher en chef, la conversation est partie un peu dans tous les sens, riche en anecdotes et souvenirs savoureux. A l’image de sa musique, au fond.</h4>
<p /><b>Bien que tu aies des fans fidèles en France, tu viens rarement y jouer. Pourquoi ?</b><br />
<strong>Pat Fish :</strong> Parce que personne ne me demande ! (rires) « Tout simplement… » (en français) On avait donné quelques concerts dans la région de Bordeaux, en 2015 je crois, mais ça fait très longtemps qu’on n’a pas joué à Paris. La dernière fois, c’était à l’Arapaho, il paraît que la salle n’existe plus. D’ailleurs, à l’époque je m’étais dit que cet endroit n’allait sans doute pas durer encore très longtemps… (rires) Je me souviens d’avoir vu Alan Vega là-bas un soir. C’était étrange car sur scène il était très agressif, menaçant les spectateurs (il l’imite). Et après le concert, on était allé le voir dans sa loge et il était tout gentil : « Oh, hi… How are you, it’s so good to see you, man ». Le changement était incroyable. Enfin, il valait mieux que ce soir dans ce sens-là que dans l’autre !

<strong>Huit de tes anciens albums ont été récemment réédités par le label <a href="https://www.firerecords.com/the-jazz-butcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire</a>, en vinyle et sous la forme de deux coffrets CD : <a href="https://www.firerecords.com/product/the-jazz-butcher-the-wasted-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Wasted Years”</a> pour la période Glass (1983-86) et <a href="https://www.firerecords.com/product/the-jazz-butcher-the-violent-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Violent Years”</a> pour la période Creation (1988-1991). Qui en a eu l’idée ?</strong><br />
Ce sont les gens de Fire qui sont venus me voir, via un ami qui travaille avec eux. Ils m’ont proposé de l’argent pour le back catalogue du Jazz Butcher et j’ai accepté en leur disant d’en faire ce qu’ils voulaient. Je suis satisfait des coffrets, ils sont fait du bon travail. Pour le premier, je leur avais dit que j’écrirais moi-même le texte du livret. Et là, je me suis retrouvé confronté à un vrai problème. Parce que le premier album du Jazz Butcher, et donc le premier que les possesseurs de cette anthologie allaient écouter, c’est “Bath of Bacon”. Un disque enregistré il y a bien longtemps… Je me mettais à la place d’un critique musical de vingt ou vingt-cinq ans qui devait écrire une chronique. En découvrant ça, il se serait sûrement dit : « Mais pourquoi ont-ils mis cette merde dans le coffret ? » (rires) Du coup, j’ai eu comme un blocage et ça m’a bien pris six mois pour écrire ces notes… parce que je ne voyais pas comment expliquer “Bath of Bacon”. J’ai fini par élaborer une théorie outrancière selon laquelle c’est un disque de DJing. Si le sampling avait existé à l’époque, il aurait été bien plus facile à faire ! Car à la base, c’est juste un assemblage d’idées musicales prises ailleurs. Des petits larcins. L’espace de dix minutes, j’ai même pensé à le refaire avec un sampler. Avant de me dire que ce serait une perte de temps ! L’intro de “Girls Who Keep Goldfish”, par exemple, c’est “I’m Set Free” du Velvet Underground. On s’attendait à voir débarquer des avocats de New York. Bon, en fait, 104 ans après, personne ne s’en est aperçu. (rires)

	<p />
<strong>Est-il prévu de ressortir les autres disques du Jazz Butcher : les singles, les albums live, ceux parus après 1991 ?</strong><br />
J’aimerais bien, cependant des problèmes se posent, notamment avec Illuminate (1995). A l’époque, Sony était impliqué et je ne sais pas si Fire est assez puissant pour récupérer les droits. Mais sinon, un troisième coffret est presque terminé. Il rassemblera les faces A et B des singles, des morceaux obscurs et, sur le quatrième CD, une session radio enregistrée à Santa Monica. L’histoire est hilarante. Nous étions en tournée en Californie depuis huit semaines, on roulait, et à un moment notre tour manager nous dit : « Ah, au fait, vous jouez live à la radio à Los Angeles ce soir ». Ça devait être diffusé en direct. On a dit qu’on ne jouerait que deux morceaux… et finalement on en a fait treize ! (il éclate de rire) Et tout le monde était ravi du résultat. Je suis vraiment heureux que l’on puisse enfin sortir cet enregistrement. Pour ce qui est des titres rares, des faces B, pffff… « C’est pas grand-chose. » (en français) Donc c’est bien d’avoir cette session radio pour rendre l’ensemble plus riche.

<strong>Tu as toujours été le seul membre permanent du groupe, à tel point qu’il se confond aujourd’hui avec toi. Pensais-tu dès le début qu’il en serait ainsi ?</strong><br />
Quand tu commences, tu ne te poses pas trop la question. Tu joues avec d’autres personnes, ça fait un groupe. Deux ans plus tard peut-être, tu comprends que tu as besoin d’une formation plus solide, avec d’autres musiciens, ça dure encore deux ou trois ans. Et là, tu te rends compte que pour que ça fonctionne, il te faut des gens qui sont libres et qui veulent le faire. Il faut éviter les situations où un membre de l’équipe n’a pas envie de jouer… J’avais un bon groupe il y a quelques années, avec lequel j’ai donné des concerts, mais il s’est évaporé. Le trompettiste, qui est également un bon peintre et un gars très sympathique, vit en Sicile maintenant…	
	<p />
<strong>Tim Keegan : Ton dernier album en date, le très réussi “<a href="https://popnews.com/2016/04/20/the-jazz-butcher-last-of-the-gentleman-adventurers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last of the Gentleman Adventurers”</a>, bénéficiait de la présence du guitariste Max Eider, membre du groupe de 1982 à 1986, puis de nouveau à partir de 1995. Mais après deux concerts, il est parti. Ça a dû être un moment difficile ?</strong><br />
C’était bizarre, c’est sûr. La journée était belle, on s’était retrouvée à la salle où on devait se produire le soir, et là, l’air sinistre, il m’a dit qu’il arrêtait la scène pour des raisons de santé, qu’il avait cru mourir la veille quand son cœur s’était emballé, à Brixton… alors qu’il avait été très bon malgré son état ! Ceci dit, je suis sûr qu’il jouera sur le prochain disque. Peut-être pas sur l’ensemble, comme pour “Gentleman Adventurers”, mais au moins sur quelques morceaux.

<strong>Par rapport à d’autres groupes des années 80 et 90, dont certains ont d’ailleurs fait leur come-back ces dernières années, The Jazz Butcher est plus difficile à cataloguer du fait de la variété de ton inspiration. Penses-tu que ça a a pu faire obstacle à un plus grand succès ?</strong><br />
Je crois surtout que mes chansons, parce qu’elle sont plutôt immédiates, n’ont pas toujours été bien comprises. Celles que les gens considéraient généralement comme fantaisistes sont plutôt mélancoliques, sombres. Prends “Love Kittens” sur “Bath of Bacon”, par exemple. Ça parle d’un homme qui est devenu tellement désenchanté par l’existence que les chatons sont la seule chose à laquelle il veut penser. C’est pathétique… J’ai joué la chanson à une fête chez un ami, il l’a filmée et mise sur Internet avec ce commentaire : « The darkest song ever written » ! <em>(voir ci-dessous) </em>J’étais content qu’il ait compris. Donc ces chansons peuvent sembler un peu idiotes, mais elles montrent comment certaines personnes peuvent finir. L’idée n’est pas de se moquer de fous. J’ai été beaucoup influencé par Syd Barrett, que je n’ai jamais considéré comme un fou… Franchement, je peux comprendre que quelqu’un en ait marre de rester assis pendant des heures dans un van mal chauffé, pour aller jouer dans un bled paumé où le public va te jeter des bouteilles. Puis de rentrer chez soi dans un froid glacial, à écouter Roger Waters parler de ses plans de carrière. Ce n’est pas de la folie. (sourire)	
	<p />

	<p />
<strong>Tu parlais de ton premier album comme d’un mix d’influences. Quel genre de musique écoutais-tu quand tu as toi-même commencé à écrire des chansons ?</strong><br />
J’avais envie que notre musique soit inclassable, et l’une des raisons de cela, c’était “London Calling” des Clash. Parce qu’avec ce disque, ils se libéraient de leur propre camisole. Une fois qu’ils ont eu Topper Headon avec eux, ils pouvaient jouer ce qu’ils voulaient. Ça a été une vraie libération pour moi aussi. Un autre groupe que j’écoutais beaucoup au début des années 80, c’était les Fun Boy Three, j’adorais leurs paroles. Ils écrivaient des chansons <i>sur quelque chose</i>, ce qui était plutôt rare à l’époque… Sinon, j’ai toujours été fan de soul music, et je crois que ça s’entend sur “Bath of Bacon”, cette façon de chanter en criant comme si je venais de Memphis… Et puis le Velvet, bien sûr. Mais j’en ai eu vite assez des clichés à leur sujet : « Ah, le Velvet Underground… Le sadomasochisme, l’héroïne, la violence de rue… » Vous plaisantez ! Quand je reprend une de leurs chansons, j’ai l’impression qu’Oncle Lou est derrière moi, qu’il pose sa main sur mon épaule en me disant d’un air calme : « yeah, it’s OK »…<em> (Tim approuve : « Big softee, Uncle Lou. Il faisait semblant, souvent. »)</em> Ce qui m’amuse avec Lou Reed, c’est qu’il effrayait les journalistes. Même quand il se montrait drôle et charmant, ils avaient encore peur de lui, et trouvaient qu’il leur avait mal parlé ! L’interview la plus drôle avec lui que j’ai vue, c’est en Afrique du Sud ou en Australie, un coin comme ça, face à un jeune journaliste genre MTV. Le type lui demande s’il est heureux d’être dans le pays en question, et Lou répond juste « non ». « Monsieur Reed, êtes-vous heureux de passer à la télé ? – Non ». Décontenancé, il lui repose la question, et Lou le regarde et répond : « Vous avez vu ce qui passe, à la télé ? » (rires)

<strong>Les notes de pochette de “Last of the Gentleman Adventurers” étaient signées par l’auteur de comics et écrivain Alan Moore. Vous êtes voisins à Northampton ?</strong><br />
Oui, il n’habite pas très loin de chez moi, et nous sommes amis depuis les années 80. Il est l’auteur des comics “Watchmen” et de “V for Vendetta”, notamment. Et récemment, il a publié un énorme roman, “Jérusalem”, dont l’un des chapitres est une parodie très élaborée de James Joyce. Bon, en fait, l’idée du livre, c’est que Northampton est le centre de l’univers, parce qu’Alan Moore y vit. (rires) C’est une étrange petite ville, mais je l’adore. C’est très difficile de la décrire, en fait… Le plus simple, ce serait de citer les paroles d’une de mes nouvelles chansons : « I live in a town where people say no ». Et c’est ce que j’aime chez les habitants de Northampton : quand il y a quelque chose qu’ils ne veulent pas faire, comme un boulot pourri, ils refusent, simplement. Il faut bien compter trente ans avant qu’ils daignent t’adresser la parole. Mais ça en vaut la peine !	
	<p />
<strong>Tim Keegan : Je crois que c’est comme ça partout en Angleterre !</strong><br />
C’est encore plus prononcé quand tu montes vers le nord. Et le sens de l’humour peut être vraiment spécial. Je me souviens d’un petit incident il y a quelques années, quand les Woodentops reformés étaient venus jouer dans un club à Northampton. Après le concert, j’étais avec eux et certains membres du Jazz Butcher, dehors, à fumer. La joueuse de claviers des Woodies était nouvelle dans le groupe, on sentait qu’elle était nerveuse et qu’elle cherchait l’assentiment des autres sur sa prestation. Mon ami Ian et moi lui expliquions justement le sens de l’humour local, que Rolo [leader des Woodentops et membre du Jazz Butcher au tout début, NDLR], lui, comprend très bien. « Les gens sont vraiment horribles les uns avec les autres, mais c’est drôle », etc. Elle nous écoutait attentivement. Et à un moment, Ian lui sort : « Ah, au fait, tu était vraiment nulle ce soir » [« you were shit tonight, by the way »]. Une parfaite illustration de ce qu’on venait de lui expliquer… Elle a fondu en larmes.

	<p />
<strong>Comment se passent tes journées à Northampton ? Tu écris des chansons ?</strong><br />
Ça m’arrive… Je joue un peu de musique tous les jours, en tout cas. Beaucoup d’interactions sociales… Je fume, je bois. Et je m’occupe de mon chat, Raoul [auquel il a consacré une chanson, NDLR] C’est lui le patron, je dois lui obéir. Je lui ouvre quand il frappe à la porte, si si !	
	<p />
<strong>Es-tu encore en contact avec Alan McGee, le fondateur du label Creation ? Il semble toujours très fan de ta musique.</strong><br />
On ne se voit pas très souvent et on ne communique pas énormément, si ce n’est pas ordinateurs interposés. Il doit bientôt venir à Northampton dans le cadre de sa tournée de conférences où, en gros, il parle du fait d’être Alan McGee… Je pense y aller pour pouvoir lui crier : « Barre-toi de la scène ! » (rires) La dernière fois qu’il était en ville, il faisait le DJ lors d’une soirée de groupes locaux. Une fois le dernier concert terminé, presque tout le monde est parti, on ne devait être plus qu’une dizaine de personnes. Et Alan a continué à passer des disques comme si sa vie en dépendait ! Il était vraiment à fond. Je pense que les dix spectateurs qui étaient encore là le connaissaient tout personnellement. Il est resté un vrai passionné de musique. J’ai vu qu’un biopic était en train d’être tourné sur lui, je ne sais pas ce que ça va donner.

	<p />
<strong>Tu jouais du saxophone quand tu étais plus jeune. C’est un instrument auquel tu restes attché ?</strong><br />
Oui, et d’ailleurs le Jazz Butcher a longtemps eu un saxophoniste, Alex Green, mais cela fait des années qu’il ne joue plus. Je me souviens d’une interview – d’ailleurs j’ai toujours la cassette, bizarrement – dans laquelle il disait, d’un air très pénétré : « Bien sûr, au tout début de l’humanité, on communiquait en soufflant dans une corne. C’est ça qui est venu en premier. » Et la dernière fois que je l’ai vu, il m’a dit qu’il avait mis son saxo au rebut ! Ça n’est plus aussi important pour lui, visiblement. Il était venu me voir chez moi, sans prévenir, on avait discuté. Je lui avais demandé ce qu’il faisait à présent, et il m’avait répondu qu’il travaillait pour la banque Barclays à Jersey. Il avait alors commencé à m’expliquer toutes les opérations un peu louches qu’il faisait, avec l’Iran, des choses comme ça, en me disant que ça restait évidemment entre nous. Et le lendemain, je vais acheter le journal, et je lis « Barclays bank in Jersey, completely corrupt : 10 page special » ! Il est sans doute en prison aujourd’hui. (rires)	
	<p />
<strong>Il y a quelques années, un nouvel album était annoncé, “The Highest in the Land”. Qu’en est-il ?</strong><br />
Il devrait sortir, sur le label Glass qui a été relancé sous le nom Glass Modern. Ils ont déjà sorti un morceau de Future Pilot AKA avec Robert Wyatt au chant. J’aime bien l’idée de renouer avec mon ancien label même si j’ai de très bons rapports avec Fire records. Pour l’instant, j’en suis au stade des maquettes, je dois avoir 60 ou 70 % des chansons. Parfois, c’est vers la fin de l’enregistrement d’un album qu’une nouvelle émerge, de façon presque inconsciente. Ça a été le cas de “La Mer”, sur le premier album. J’avais passé tout l’après-midi dessus sans en être satisfait. Soudain, j’ai eu l’idée d’écrire un texte en français, et hop, ça fonctionnait. Souvent, le fait d’être limité en temps stimule l’imagination.

						This memorial celebration of the life and music of Pat Fish took place at the Dublin Castle instead of the intended actual gig by Pat Fish who sadly passed away before the gig could take place, but as we all know how much Pat hated cancelling any live gigs, So Promoter Jane Barnes and Dave Morgan decided that rather than cancelling the show that Dave was meant to be putting a band together for, he would instead expand the band and hold this wonderful tribute night, for that, all who took part or attended or watched it on the livestream are hopefully as grateful as I am for a wonderful celebration in the spirit Pat has embodied throughout his life and career. The cast included members of among other bands The Jazz Butcher, The Weather Prophets, The Loft, The Jasmine Minks, Scarlets Well, The Monochrome set, The Woodentops, 13 Frightened Girls, Helen and The Horns, Heidi Berry, Blurt, The June Brides, The Wolfhounds etc.
	<p />
The Dublin Castle was packed before the gig doors opened with loads of friends and faces all of whom had connected with Pat one way or another over the years, I had been a fan since about 1985 when I bought Abstract Magazine Issue 5 that came with a Vinyl LP with The Jazz Butchers cover of John Cale's Leaving It Up To You as the closing song.  I met Pat for the first time in 1989 in Paris and remained friends ever since, like many other people at the gig I have a large stock of stories about Pat. Apologies for any imaginary band names.
	<p />
The evening began with a short speech by Dave Morgan to explain how he ended up as band leader and co-ordinator of tonight's gig as Pat had asked him to help put a band together for this gig to help start the promotion of the new Jazz Butcher Album The Highest In The Land, that's due out on Tapete Records in the New Year. He then handed over the microphone to Jem Price the evenings compere and continuity man to give a brief speech about Pat and why we were all here before he introduced the evenings first act Joe Turner.
	<p />
Joe had flown in from the USA and was playing solo and sang a rather wonderful version of Olaf Palme the song about the senseless assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister who was the least worthy Prime Minister of such treatment, the wry humor was there as plenty of emotion in Joe's intro and singing.
	<p />
Next on was Tim Keegan with the new Sikkorskis that included Dave Morgan on Drums, Peter Crouch on the Left wing Guitar, John Silver on Bass, Simon Mawby on Guitar and Jim Shepherd on backing vocals for a quite brilliant version of Next Move Sideways from the ever legendary Fishcoteque album, a song I turned into a poem with Pat's permission that I need to dig out, this was the first song that I saw tears flowing in the audience for.
	<p />
They then went back to Scandal In Bohemia for a wonderful sing along to Southern Mark Smith that kept all of the songs humor and intent and got us all smiling.
	<p />
We then had some line-up changes with Tim, Dave and Simon being joined by 13 Frightened Girls and Heidi Berry so Heidi could sing a very moving version of Keeping The Curtains Closed a song about depression and paranoia that feels very current with how things have been in the last couple of years.
	<p />
The big band was replaced by Helen McCookerybook performing solo, as ever in a checked shirt and jeans, it was great to see Helen live again, ahead of her show at The Troubadour next month, she played one of Pat's favorite Velvet Underground songs and a really nice version of Femme Fatale with the audience providing the backing vocals on the chorus.
	<p />
Next on was Blurt legend Jowe Head who was joined by Dave Morgan on Drums, Jim Shepherd on bass and David Musker on keyboards to sing the rather redolent Someone To Share My Life With that pulls on the heartstrings in all the right places and Jowe certainly got to the songs spirit. 
	<p />
After a bit of jiggling about it was time for Jem Price to sing as well as compere as he brought together his Basement Cultists that included Jim Shepherd on Guitar, Dave Morgan on drums David Musker on Keyboards and Simon Mawby on Guitar and was it Lawrence O'Keefe on bass for a wonderful version of Peter Lorre that unfolded after a false start or two. 
	<p />
The band then expanded with an additional percussionist, Tim Keegan replacing Jim Shepherd and Peter Crouch coming on as substitute for Bicycle Kid one of the only songs I couldn't sing along with, it sounded great with the band sounding like they had been playing it every night for a month. 
	<p />
They then closed the first half of the show with a wonderful version of Mr Odd that almost everyone in the Dublin Castle sang along too and we all know someone who fits in with the sort of character Mr Odd is about.
	<p />
After the break where lots of us caught up with old friends and made some new ones too hopefully, we were all ready to hear one of Pat's favorite songs and Matt Sewell was on hand to tell us about hearing Pat play John  Cale's Thoughtless Kind late at night at Fishy Mansions after his last home town gig before he played a rather emotional version of this classic whose lyrics only grow more pertinent as we all grow older this was a bit of a tear jerking start to the second half for lots of us.
	<p />
We then had Jem Price hand over to John Schoneboom for the evenings contest to win one of 4 copies of Uncommonalities Volume II that features a story by Pat in it, that's available on Amazon if you need a copy.
	<p />
Next on were 13 Frightened Girls who played a song from Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers Saints Prayer that had lots of messages of redemption within it and was quite stirring on an already emotional night, they then added Heidi Berry to the band for Matter Of Time that Sumishta Brahm wrote with Pat, that just seemed to speak to the feelings many of us have had recently, they had a poignancy that was spot on for the evening.
	<p />
After a quick change around on came Pete Astor and some of the Weather Prophets and they did one of Pat's favorite Kevin Ayers songs Shouting In A Bucket Blues that sounded magnificent and was certainly more together than the last time I heard Kevin Ayers play it live.  Pete then introduced his tribute to Pat song that put loads of emotion and loads of memories of the times they had together into a Fine & Dandy tribute.
	<p />
Next up were The Jasmine Mink Conspiracy with Jim Shepherd, Dave Morgan, Dean Leggett, Simon Mawby, John Silver, Dave Musker and Tim Keegan who were all ready to show us that they were in fact Real Men some of whom came from Hell and some from other places as they got us all singing along to this classic hit and the dual drumming of Dave Morgan and Dean Leggett was quite something including the Adam and The Ants steals. 
	<p />
Sweet Jane had to get played at the tribute as Pat loved to get drunk enough to play it, although I'm not certain anyone on stage was that drunk, they brought on super sub Peter Crouch for this, either way it was a cool version of that classic.
	<p />
We then got into the evening's dapper section as Bid From The Monochrome set made a suitably grand entrance as if he was emerging from Scarlet's Well once more to be joined by Dave Morgan, Simon Mawby, David Musker and John Silver for a brilliant version of Domestic Animals that brought a big smile to mine and many other faces. 
	<p />
One of Pat's oldest friends and collaborators Rolo McGinty then took centre stage for his new tribute song to Pat Another World that was played by the same band that backed Bid and well they smashed it out the park and damn well stole the show, the song is so on the money and full of the pain of loss of someone who has brought so much joy into Rolo's life as well as everyone else's lives, indeed Fishy has gone to heaven and we all want to own this song on a 12" single.
	<p />
After the hurricane that was Rolo it was time for Tim Keegan and Jim Shepherd along with tonight's adventurers Dave Morgan, Peter Crouch, John Silver to play a heart-breaking version of Angels to make sure that anyone with a heart had another tear or two rolling down their faces.
	<p />
David Lance Callahan was given the unenviable task of singing Pat Fish's final single Time off of The Highest In the Land a song full of Pat's thoughts on his inevitable passing, The Hounds backing him up on this task were Dave Morgan, John Silver, Simon Mawby and Peter Crouch, rarely do songs hit quite as many spots as this one does, it was a wonderful tribute and a fitting farewell.
	<p />
All that left time for was one last big sing along to one of Pat's favourite songs to cover Camper Van Beethovens Take The Skinheads Bowling and the Jasmine Sikkorskis from hell really got everyone singing along to the chorus and smiling at the end of a brilliant night, they had run out of time so we didn't get the final encore of Roadrunner but it didn't matter as this was a perfect way to end a brilliant tribute to everyone's great friend Pat Fish.

Bloody Nonsense (Polygram)

The first domestic release from four deranged Britons contains tracks previously available only on imports ova’ here, in addition to some brand now stuff. C.C. Dflmmorung of Slntul Boat described them as, "a seml-llterato pub crawl through the swamps of rock’s rich tapestry, laced with self-destructive recreational pursuits and maddened by the buzzing of 1000 punk guitars." The Jazz Butcher grinds through thirteen tracks that range from a fuzzed-out 'Caroline Wheoler's Birthday Present' ("do you know what happens when you leave a tlsh In an e/ova for?.../ ’ll give you a hlnt...lt’s biodegradable"), to the beer-hall thumper 'The Devil Is My Friend'.

		Friends and musicians have paid tribute to Pat Fish who sadly died last week, describing him as “a true artist” and “great songwriter”.
		<p />
		One of Northampton’s most influential figures during the 1980s, Pat formed and was also best known as The Jazz Butcher.
		<p />
		Born in London, Patrick Huntrods moved to Northampton after studying in Oxford, forming The Jazz Butcher in the early 1980s with Max Eider.
		<p />
		While he would continue to play under that moniker, it was Pat’s willingness to write, record and perform with others which meant the band’s line up featured dozens of musicians over the years.
		<p />
		The Jazz Butcher released a series of albums on Glass Records in the first half of the 1980s before they signed with Alan McGee’s Creation Records.
		<p />
		In a recent tribute to Fish on Instagram, label boss McGee said: “(Pat was) one of the first people who believed in Creation.
		<p />
		“At that point, 1986/1987, when we signed Pat, no one would come on Creation except unknown bands and he was a big deal.
		<p />
		“Him and Lawrence Hayward (Felt) - we got these guys and we could do international licensing deals and although he didn’t go on and sell millions, and he should have, he was part of the reason that we actually did well.”
		<p />
		Sometimes also known as The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy or The Jazz Butcher And His Sikkorskis From Hell, the band’s sound was rooted in indie and alternative.
		<p />
		The Jazz Butcher’s first album on Creation was 1988’s Fishcotheque and they went onto release numerous albums on the label.
		<p />
		McGee added: “You need these artists to build labels, and there were these guys, especially Pat, who were never about the money it was just about wanting to put his records out.
		<p />
		“I’m gutted for Pat. Such a good human being, such a true artist, such a great songwriter and such a nice bloke. Rest in peace.”
		<p />
		Aside from The Jazz Butcher, Pat also featured in bands such as Wilson, Black Eg, Sumosonic, Spacemen 3 and more recently The Drones Club.
		<p />
		Alex Novak, who runs Spiral Archive record shop, has played in numerous bands in Northampton over the past 30 years, including the Venus Fly Trap, Religious Overdose and Tempest.
		<p />
		He said musicians like Pat played a crucial part in the “cross fertilisation,” of acts in Northampton, which at the time included Bauhaus.
		<p />
		He said: “It was when Pat moved to Northampton that the genesis of The Jazz Butcher properly began.
		<p />
		“We were on the same label, I was in Religious Overdose and then Tempest and that’s where the whole connection started
		<p />
		“There was also the links with David J and Kevin Haskins from Bauhaus, there was a lot of cross fertilisation in the Northampton music scene at the time with Glass Records in the middle of it.
		<p />
		“As Tempest, we did quite a few gigs with The Jazz Butcher and then later on Pat played saxophone on one of the Venus Fly Trap records and produced Pandoras Box which we recorded in France.”
		<p />
		Mr Novak explained while some bands and musicians don’t work with others, it was the opposite for Pat, adding, “He didn’t have any siblings or children and I think other musicians became part of his close family.
		<p />
		“I think people get complacent and think people will be around for ever, it’s important we appreciate people while they're around.”
		<p />
		While Pat would continue to play as The Jazz Butcher, one of his more recent projects was as bassist in The Drones Club.
		<p />
		The Drones Club, which has its roots in the folk scene and play ancestral and improvised music, came together in 2014 and were formed by Ian Clabburn and Russell Cooper - the latter who Pat had previously played with in both Wilson and Sumosonic. Pat replaced the band's first bassist and they were later joined by guitarist Steve Gordon on guitar.
		<p />
		Mr Clabburn said “Pat was very generous with his expertise.
		<p />
		“It’s a great loss. There was no pretention, he took you at face value and there was never a subtext. “You can't say that about many people.
		<p />
		“It was Pat who took a disparate group of musicians and with good humour moulded them into a cohesive band with its own sound.
		<p />
		“I learned so much and feel that I am a better musician, for which I will be forever grateful.”
		<p />
		The Drones Club continued to meet weekly until Pat’s recent death, to rehearse, with Mr Clabburn admitting it was “often more of a social get together, peppered with Pat's apparently endless supply of anecdotes”.
		<p />
		“It was an honour and privilege to play with someone with so much talent, so much drive and so much determination. We will miss him deeply,” he added.
		<p />
		Besides performing music, Pat also hosted indie music show Transmission which was broadcast on ITV at the end of the 1980s.
		<p />
		In recent years, Fire Records had started an extensive series of Jazz Butcher reissues from his time on Glass and Creation records.
		<p />
		Pat had also become a regular performer online, hosting numerous gigs from ‘Fishy Mansions’.
		<p />
		It’s understood that Pat had also been working on a new album which is expected to be released in the future.

While he was making his final album as the Jazz Butcher, Pat Fish knew he was going to die. According to people close to him, he’d managed to outrace cancer, but decades of pint-hoisting good times were catching up with him. He passed away last October at age 64. But one remarkable thing about The Highest in the Land is how little morbidity encumbers it. On the contrary, it positively brims with life. Even when Fish stares down death in the dub-rock countdown “Time,” it’s with the same old gleam in his eye and dodge in his step.
<p />
“Fishy go to Heaven, get along, get along,” he drawls, rakish and sarcastic, rushing toward “a pit of Council lime.” But most of the other lyrics are acid pronouncements tangled in exuberant wordplay. The verses excoriate lithium mining and privatized jails, but the pre-choruses are stuffed with nearly nonsense lists of shapely words: luminous, leguminous, salubrious, lugubrious. Part giddy fuck-you-I’m-out to an England he’d suffered from Thatcher to Brexit, part psychedelic experience with a rhyming dictionary, “Time” is all Fish. In other words, this cockeyed memento mori is just another great Butch tune on another great Butch record: irascible, inscrutable, delectable, irreducible.
<p />
Irreducible, yes, but to start somewhere: What if the punk-folk protester Billy Bragg fell under the nihilistic spell of the Velvet Underground instead of the messianic one of the Clash? Fish—who was born on the same day in 1957 as Bragg, also less than 100 miles from London—was the living answer to this hypothetical question and many others. His was a cold-war leftist politics through a glass darkly, a Philip K. Dick allusion he probably would have liked, as someone who paid homage to Thomas Pynchon and Harlan Ellison and was admired by the occult comics guru Alan Moore. Even his most comical, outrageous songs were drawn with fine lines of wealth and class, and his most polemical moments were obscured by non sequiturs of incomparable chewiness. Most of all, he thrived on bloodletting observations of the human dramedy in all its vapid cupidity and ordinary beauty.
<p />
A native of Northampton, in the East Midlands, Fish either formed or became the Jazz Butcher, depending on how you look at it, while studying philosophy at Oxford. It started as a persona for his precocious, playful adventures in home-recording, and it retained that conceptual flavor as it flourished into a band with a revolving moniker (The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, The Jazz Butcher and His Sikkorskis from Hell) and lineup, which was rooted by members like guitarist Max Eider but also berthed Spacemen 3’s Sonic Boom and the bassist David J, when he was between Bauhaus and Love and Rockets.
<p />
In the ’80s and early ’90s, the Jazz Butcher’s many albums for the British indies Glass and Creation Records (recommended entry points are Sex and Travel or Big Planet Scarey Planet) displayed a variety that’s bewildering even by UK post-punk standards: twee jangle-pop, Dixieland jazz, arch agit-punk, romantic new wave, country blues, surf-rock, Merseybeat, sophisti-pop, lounge music, Mediterranean wedding songs, on and on. Fish loved soul, Syd Barrett, Bob Dylan, and above all, John Cale—sturdy, classic ’60s things. The surplus he extrapolated from them indicates a true eccentric original. Yet he makes it all whole by sheer force of songcraft, flaunting an innate gift for drizzling charismatic melodies on spare, resourceful arrangements in any style.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher’s recordings thinned away after 1995, and were mostly out of print and forgotten until Fire Records began a series of reissues about seven years ago. It was around then that Fish, Eider, and other trusted bandmates began working on The Highest in the Land, where they sound startlingly fresh after a decade away. Though done up in the usual power-clashing genres, the songs are mainly either ballads that spill into rants (“Never Give Up,” with very different production and the end lopped off, could pass for a minor Coldplay hit) or vice versa. They call to mind a pleasure dome of fetching, unrelated references: the demotic prowess of Jens Lekman, the melodic immediacy of the Lucksmiths, the wry dandyism of XTC, the dialectical swoon of Stars, and of course, the curdled cool of Cale.
<p />
Whether the style is antic, enervated country-and-western (“Running on Fumes”) or dreamy electric soul (“Goodnight Sweetheart”), the music is kept clean and spacious so Fish can fit all his wonderful words inside. He is a wellspring of quotable surrealism. Taste an impenetrable couplet like “The black-crested ape of Boo Yang Shang, sing like a theremin, walk like a man.” Feel the cryptic gut-punch of a question like “Tiny cans of Coke for free—is that what you chose over me?” Another song begins, “I got this fish from Genghis Khan,” which has to rival “Fat Charlie the Archangel sloped into the room” in the pantheon of perfectly weird opening lines.
<p />
Fish never had qualms about referencing people we couldn’t possibly be expected to know about, and he preserved this intimate, local aesthetic to the end. It starts immediately with “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar,” a slinky jazz-cat number in which a tale of young love divided by wealth ends in merry anti-capitalist flames. An additional layer of mystery exists for the non-British listener, who easily infers that Formby must be posh and an East Midlands accent must not be, but who might need to look up things like gammons and Children of the Stones. But no amount of googling can pierce “The Highest in the Land,” a portentous desert blues about Genghis Khan and apes and whatever Boo Yang Shang is, although apparently the “Black Raoul” who Fish chants about is known to hardcore fans as his cat. The song is vividly personal to a riddling degree, and it seems significant that it, rather than one of the more outspoken tracks, provided the album’s title.
<p />
As densely English as Fish’s music is, he had an anti-isolationist vision of the country, with a sensibility that spanned Europe and profound musical influence from North America. “Sea Madness,” a pastoral folk tune with warm, tired horns, is a tribute to a legendary figure on the local Northampton music scene, an immigrant from Istanbul called Turkish George. “Sebastian’s Medication” seems to have Brexiters in its sights when Fish dresses down the gammons “pining for some ill-defined imaginary nation, antecedents they would struggle to name.”
<p />
As soon as this clear statement comes into view, Fish dances away from it, invoking the right’s favorite shibboleth of “political correctness gone mad.” He liked to keep himself just out of frame, unpinned to any didactic point of view. Inasmuch as The Highest in the Land is a winning globalist view from the provinces, it is not concerned with progressive lip service. “Any moment now, somebody’s going to say ‘toxic,’ that’s assured,” Fish sings on “Running on Fumes.” “Yes, ’cause people love to talk that way, but people only ever made me bored.” His misanthropy is comprehensive, unmalicious, and countered by empathy and sentimentality. “I never really identified with the ‘social commentator’ thing, any more than I did with the asinine ‘Monty Python of rock’ label with which some deaf people tried to saddle us back in the ’80,” he said in a 2020 interview. But The Highest in the Land, a just and honest headstone, captures the substance and self-definition of a singular songwriter where words and labels fail.

Over the last few years the Monolith Cocktail has been sharing a post each month with the leading Italian culture/music site Kalporz. This month Matteo Maioli celebrates the late enigmatic Pat Fish, aka The Jazz Butcher.
<p />
How many times does it happen that the legacy of a band becomes important after they break up, or if the artist leaves us prematurely? Pat Fish, a London-based singer-songwriter based in Oxford known to all as The Jazz Butcher, passed away on October 5th at the age of 63.
<p />
As soon as he graduated, he devoted himself unconditionally to music with Sonic Tonix by releasing a single on Cherry Red, just before coining (in ‘82) the name of the project for which he will always be remembered – since the other aliases The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy and The Jazz Butcher And His Sikkorskis From Hell are already more difficult. In the first records for the Glass label he played with David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, while Max Eiderhe will remain Pat Fish’s main collaborator until the last days: a four-year period, that of 1983-1986, best covered by the vinyl of ‘Bloody Nonsense’ that I found years ago at a flea market for two coins but which today is a level artistic testimony and harbinger of jewels such as ‘Big Saturday’, ‘The Human Jungle’ and ‘The Devil Is My Friend’: A mix of worker folk, Velvet Underground and soul music.
<p />
The ball then passes to Alan McGee, who with Creation released eight The Jazz Butcher albums, up until 1995. Fish becomes a sparring partner here, as the budget is oriented towards other bands (House Of Love, Primal Scream), amazed at the disorganization and the coarseness of an indie without any connection with the American market: therefore tracks like ‘Next Move Sideways’ and the psychedelic ‘Girl Go’, from ‘Cult Of The Basement’ slide without leaving a trace.
<p />
The only exploit comes in spite of himself from the acid-house style cover of ‘We Love You’, the Rolling Stones hit in 1967, which would guarantee him participation on Top Of The Pops; to understand the integrity of the artist Pat Fish it is enough to read the exchange of views he had with McGee in this regard: “Pat, You won’t believe it – 400 kids on the floor punching the air to your record!” “Yeah, right.” Yet even looking at Upside Down: The Creation Records Story we note the pride of Fish in having lived that fundamental period for English music, albeit as a gregarious but with personality, loved and respected by all.
<p />
<p />
For about ten years there was no news of The Jazz Butcher, when in 2012 he returned with Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, proudly self-produced. His work is characterized by a fervent passion for literature and cinema and social commitment, elements that also permeate the last album released by Tapete on February 4, 2022. The Highest Of The Land joins epitaphs such as Blackstar by David Bowie and Rowland S. Howard’s Pop Crimes, similarly recorded in the last days of life and who do everything not to be: we fight against the end, taking talent over the obstacle.
<p />
Between poetry and jazz settings, reverence for Bob Dylan and the new-wave, Pat Fish puts together a collection of splendid songs, including sarcasm (“My hair’s all wrong / My time ain’t long / Fishy go to Heaven, get along, get along” on ‘Time’) and urgency (“I said I would break my stupid life in two / For half an hour alone with you” on ‘Never Give Up’) with a cosmopolitan touch for ‘Sea Madness’. The album produced by Lee Russell (formerly with The Moons and Nada Surf) is the ideal starting point to discover this great songwriter, man of the world bringer of peace.

Pat Fish announced himself as a singular talent with 1983 debut In Bath Of Bacon, summoning zombies, sasquatches and "sex engines" over outrageous lifts from Wilson Pickett, The Bar-Kays and The Normal.The Londoner proved a fiercely literate talent over three more albums partly defined by the Wes Montgomery filigree of guitarist Max Eider. Four years of heavy touring (and drinking) made them US college radio favourites. But when Eider split in 1987, Fish went deeper, issuing intricately layered, sample-detailed LPs for Creation that revealed a one-off animist songwriter, capable of gentle mirth and gut-wrenching sadness. A committed prole and erudite raconteur, Fish had just completed 13th LP The Highest In The Land when he died peacefully at home, two days after ill health forced the cancellation of a live Facebook show.

This certainly seems to be the week for it, so I’m going to blame Mark Zuckerberg for the way I’m feeling right now. No, the Facebook outage did not depress me (in fact, it prompted a friend and I to commit to “Zuckerberg-free Mondays,” which start next week). Nor did news of the evil behind the scenes at Facebook particularly surprise me.
<p />
Instead, I am laid low because a musician whose work I have loved for most of my life died suddenly this week. That news alone would have been enough to put me in the dumps. But because of Zuckerberg’s infernal machine, I not only heard about his death — I had been able to connect with him as a Facebook friend a few years ago. I only managed to see his band perform live once. But suddenly, Pat Fish was among my friends on Facebook, right there alongside my mother and my preschool classmates and my online pals.
<p />
This was exciting, because now I could tag him whenever I posted a song of his that I appreciated. So I did, not expecting much response, but often being pleasantly surprised to get one:
<p />
I’d loved the different iterations of Pat’s band, which was called the Jazz Butcher or the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, depending on the release, since hearing a song of theirs on the radio in high school. The track, “Hungarian Love Song,” made you want to dance, but not the way people danced in clubs. It made you want to learn a form of dance you’d never even seen before. The lyrics cheekily described a love affair leading to cannibalism. My teen self, ever alert to quirkiness, responded immediately, and I set out in search of the album the song appeared on. It was never easy to find Jazz Butcher releases, and that’s the only one I have on vinyl.
<p />
As I delved deeper into the Jazz Butcher’s oeuvre, I found a band with multiple personalities, my favorite kind. They could rock hard but also were liable to charm the pants off you. There was a good deal of saxophone, but it wasn’t deployed in a cringey 1980s way. In college, finding out that someone I was interested in owned a Jazz Butcher cassette raised my interest in them immeasurably (whether deserved or not). There seemed to be a Jazz Butcher song for every mood I had. Like one, simple on its surface, sung from the perspective of penguins (“We are penguins./Only penguins./We are flightless./We are standing in the snow/Without food./`Coz we’re penguins/It’s what we do./On the ice floe of unknowing./And it’s freezing…”) that disarms you with its poignancy. Danceable numbers like “She’s On Drugs,” narrating a woman in the midst of collapse with ranginess and humor — but remaining ever the gentleman. There are lots of angels in the songs. And there is Shirley MacLaine. This music has accompanied me through adolescence, college, and my first experiences with independent living, heartbreak, ambition, relationships… all of it.
<p />
J. recently got us a turntable, after many years of living without one, and I cued my one Jazz Butcher album up just the other day. As I just wrote to a friend who is also mourning Pat, “I miss all of it. I miss the world how it was, where you would put a record on and just sit there listening to it. It wasn’t a backdrop. It is astonishingly hard to find the time for that now.”
<p />
<p />
I forgot the quirk of this album: the labels were put on reversed. So I started listening with Side 2.
The same weekend that I listened to this album for the first time in ages, Pat was to planning to play a live set on Facebook from his living room, which he dubbed Fishy Mansions. I’d put it on my calendar, and planned to tune in to hear him for the first time since he’d done a similar gig during early pandemic times. I knew the band had recently recorded an album and was hoping he might preview a track from it. Instead, Pat came on to say he hadn’t slept the night before, that he’d had sleep apnea, and he was sorry, but he wouldn’t be able to play for us. He was sipping a pint, as always, and cuddling his black cat, Raoul, as always. He seemed to be in some respiratory distress, though. I was unnerved, because a couple of years ago, he’d been treated for cancer. I identified with him on that level, as well — we’d both emerged from cancer.
<p />
Since I added Pat as a friend on Facebook, I got to know him a little bit. The first thing to know was that he was a huge fan of cats. In reading posthumous tributes, I’ve lost count of the number of people who have mentioned that he wrote them to wish their cat a happy birthday, or commented on a cat photo they’d posted.
<p />
I didn’t post any cat photos. All the same, I unexpectedly found myself on the receiving end of unsolicited reactions and comments on my posts from Pat. Supportive ones when I posted about being a cancer survivor. But other things too:
<p />
<p />
<p />
All of a sudden, Pat was not just the source of music that had formed the soundtrack of my adult life. He felt more like a friend, one who knew how to contribute in just the right ways on social media. And Tuesday morning, I opened up Facebook to learn he was gone — suddenly, peacefully, but gone. I won’t have any more opportunities to convey my appreciation for what his music meant. I won’t get to watch him play another live gig from his living room, cat jumping in and out of frame.
<p />
A close friend of his posted to a forum today:
<blockquote class="annotation">
He was very happy over the last few months of his life, probably more so than I’d seen him in a long time, and it was mainly down to you lot. He was absolutely knocked out by your response to the “Live At Fishy Mansions” sessions. He was pretty much broke before he started doing them but everyone’s generosity with the tip jar meant that his financial problems were solved – the money from it kept him in food (not that he ate much!), beer, smokables, and beefy biscuits for Raoul.
</blockquote>
So there is that: We, his fans, had helped him to not die destitute or in despair. It should feel like enough, to know that an artist who gave you so much felt acknowledged and tangibly appreciated at the end. But — all because of Zuckerberg — he was not just an artist to me. He was MY FRIEND. And he is gone when he should be here to receive the torrents of adulation that a dead artist gets.
<p />
Another celebrity I follow on Facebook (but who is not a friend), legendary illustrator Sandra Boynton, posted this photo yesterday, which she took in her office as the sun set:

For anyone who isn’t aware or is aware of the late Pat Fish’s back catalogue of work, “The Highest In The Land” is an album which is testament to his talent, charm, spirit and wit. Collaborated with Dave Morgan (The Weather Prophets), the album is a cool breeze of neo-jazz, swing, post-punk, new-wave, neo-psych, neo-blues and alt-rock all meticulously crafted to create a distinctive, sophisticated and foot-tapping album. It’s an album that revisits the classic roots of jazz in an underground of smoky strings, beatnik brass and breezy beats added with a cocktail of jangly reverberation.
<p />
Listening to the album is like taking a long road-trip through the avenues of life, reflecting at the crossroads and looking back with warm nostalgia. It’s a melancholic map of love, politics and philosophical musings that is lit up by the sun-drenched spirituality. Along with the earnest lyrics, the album touches the heart and empathises with the soul. It’s through the sheer quality of the songs presented that the album stands out as a timeless work of art, that enjoys the joviality, the low-fi  leanings, with a few belly-laughs along the way. It’s through the on-set chemistry of the band, that the album effortlessly flows, creating a spontaneous stream of subtle musical mutations.
<p />
Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar, swings into action in a  breeze of farfisa fog and tepid taps. It’s a cool-cat excursion to neo-jazz, in a sprightly sing-along of warm nostalgia and soul yearnings. Along with the hazy horns and free-styling flickers, Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar ascends from the vaults of New Orleans, whilst intermixed with a backdrop of urban post-punk. It’s a great opening track, which sets the tone for the rest of this splendid album.
<p />
Through the spacey-synths and drones, Time captures the existentialistic essence of the track, whilst floating towards the fifth dimension of New-wave. Through the bobbing bass, sophisti-pop jangles, Time travels towards the funked-up realms of Post-punk, whilst creating a backdrop of urban spoken-word.
<p />
Through the up-beat drums and jangly riffs, Sea Madness dives into the pools of neo-folk, whilst soaking up the sentiments of the track. Through the elongated vocals and poetic lyrics, Sea Madness floats wistfully aside the farfisa fog, whilst heading towards a neo-psych shore.
<p />
Never Give Up swirls and whirls in a repetition of lovelorn lyrics, aside the neo-psych vapour. It’s pensive poetry steeped in dark romanticism and whose ballad-esque reverberation resonates in the shadows of alt-country/blues.
<p />
A Coast May 1963 resides in the 60s lounge of bossa-nova jazz, that surfs aside the choppy strums of Spanish shores. It’s an instrumental gem, that farfisa flows towards the baroque-rocks of neo-psychedelia. Along with the cascading sweeps of Orchestral pop, A Coast May 1963 remains in the time-capsule of a golden age.
<p />
Running on Fumes pulsates with upbeat drums on the mountain tops of alt-country, beneath the farfisa fog of neo-psychedelica. It’s a fast-moving track, whose thought-provoking lyrics and catchy chorus, head-spins you into a contemplative corner of neo-blues.
<p />
The Highest In The Land side-saddles like a cosmic cowboy across an alt-blues highway. It’s a captivating track, whose intriguing lyrics transcend a spiritual awakening in the realms of spoken-word and punk-poetry. Along with the flicker riffs and dusky drones, The Highest In The Land peers from celestial heights, whilst taking a trip to the psychedelic rock era of yesteryear.
<p />
Sebastian Medication is a breezy and combatant track that saunters and shouts from its political soapbox. Lyrically astute, Sebastian Medication flies the post-punk flag, whilst reflecting from its beacon of fuzzy, jangly light. It’s an inflamed catharsis, a champion of the underdog, a wilful stance in an age of uncertainty.
<p />
Goodnight  Sweetheart is a poignant slow-burner, that quivers and vibrates from every iota of emotion. It’s a track that is steeped in melancholy and whose crestfallen lyrics pull from its neo-blues/psych heart-strings, and lingers in the shadows of time and space.
<p />
Listening to the Jazz Butcher’s album ” The Highest In The Land ” is a bittersweet experience. On one hand it’s a sensory pleasure, a real joy to listen to and then on the other hand, it’s so sad to know that this is a posthumous album. For anyone who knew Pat, they all said the same thing – that he was a lovely, intelligent, funny, charismatic and talented person who was taken too soon. However, on a positive note, this album is a celebration of Pat’s life and the music that brought so many people happiness. May his legacy live on.
<p />
“The Highest In The Land” is dedicated to Patrick Guy Sibley Huntrods AKA Pat Fish – The Jazz Butcher (20th December 1957 – 5th October 2021)

The Highest in the Land is the Jazz Butcher‘s (aka Pat Fish, née Patrick Huntrods) first studio album since Last of the Gentleman Adventurers in 2012. Sadly, it is also his last. Fish died at home in October 2021. He was only 63, but on “Time” from the new record, he seems resigned to his fate: “My hair’s all wrong / My time ain’t long / Fishy go to Heaven, get along, get along.” In a recent series of fan Q&A videos, Fish is hardly seen without a cigarette or a pint in hand. He did it his way, playing small club shows and, later, online sessions with his friends, staying classy, with no regrets.
<p />
This intimate, comfortable mood translates to The Highest in the Land. The sultry, woozy, 1920s-style shuffle of “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar” sets the tone, sounding like it is wafting in from the smoky backroom of a bygone speakeasy. The appearance of longtime foil Max Eider on guitar adds to the vintage feel.
<p />
Within this cozy milieu, The Highest in the Land is typically eclectic, touching on several styles that Fish is fond of—pop, rock, rockabilly, blues, and, of course, jazz. All of it is grounded in pleasingly jangly hollow body guitar. The one exception to the overall feel, and the one musical surprise, is the instrumental “Amalfi Coast May 1963”. The track sounds exactly like its title, referencing an Italian coastal village. The gently shuffling rhythm and odd time signature lead to swooning, widescreen strings, and a melody that suggests drama, but not enough to disturb the cocktail in one’s hand. It’s a retro easy-listening treat that would be equally at home on Bert Kaempfert or Saint Etienne records, one that reveals a musical sophistication that is easy to overlook given Fish’s pop smarts.
<p />
By the time they reach their later careers, some artists reach the point where the music is primarily a means to experience their lyrics, wisdom, and general gravitas. Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, and Lou Reed come to mind. Is the Butcher worthy of such company? Surely. Although he did not reach the same level of critical attention or even commercial success, Fish was as keen, witty, insightful, and, when necessary, as ruthless.
<p />
The Highest in the Land provides plenty of evidence. While the album is missing the manic discontent that often made its way into earlier work, the relative restfulness of the music belies Fish’s disillusion and frustration with the current state of affairs.
<p />
When writing about any Jazz Butcher release, the temptation is to list off all the great vignettes, images, and one-liners, and The Highest in the Land is no different. “Lemmy and Bowie and Prince—all gone,” Fish laments on “Running on Fumes”. The lesson? “People like us can’t have nice things.” The track is a takedown of those who instill fear and struggle for their own gain: “Is there anything as cheap as chasing profit from despair?” he asks. Though he leaves the listener to fill in the blanks, it seems he must be speaking of politicians, global elites, and, quite possibly, corporations. “Any moment now somebody’s going to say ‘Toxic’, that’s assured,” he predicts toward the end of the song. He may be older, but Fish is still pretty quick on his feet. The music, too, is jaunty skiffle, an album standout.
<p />
That isn’t the only place where Fish offers some vitriol for today’s social media-obsessed, cancel-happy culture. On “Sebastian’s Medication”, he calls it “political correctness gone mad”. His assessment is astute and eloquently worded enough to preclude any suspicion he is acting the curmudgeon: “[Everybody] screaming on the laptop in the basement / Store all the hate up and wait for it to burst out / I can’t believe you’re such an architect of your own destruction.” Again, the Stonesy music follows suit with a drawn-out, multi-tempo, distorted guitar solo. It’s not quite the incendiary noise of some past Butcher tracks, but it is easily the album’s most energized moment.
<p />
Those who know Fish’s music will know he was also an unrepentant romantic. Thus, The Highest in the Land features a couple of his earnestly pretty ballads in “Never Give Up” and the poignantly-titled closing track “Goodnight Sweetheart”. Even here, though, the edge remains sharp. “Never give up,” Fish declares on the former, “until you want to.” His way, indeed.
<p />
Throughout, Fish’s distinctive tenor is still boyish but also wizened and strangely comforting. Though it is certainly not a major release in what amounts to an incredible, 40-year canon, The Highest in the Land takes on particular importance because of its posthumous nature, rendering its creator’s premature death even more saddening. While the Butcher may have had nothing left to prove, he certainly had much more to say.

The final, and farewell, album from The Jazz Butcher and its uniquely free spirited and offbeat frontman Pat Fish is a joyous celebration of his music. Trademarked by his wry observational humour, and cutting commentary on life, while at the same time containing a touching and often heartbreaking poignancy as he says goodbye across these nine sublime songs.
<p />
Parting Shot
The Highest in the Land feels like Pat’s version of Bowie’s Blackstar (he makes a nod to Bowie alongside Lennon & Prince in Running on Fumes) or Leonard Cohen’s, You Want it Darker? A confrontation of his, and everyone else’s mortality, almost a knowing nod that this would be his parting shot.
<p />
Don’t get me wrong, the album isn’t filled with doom and gloom or a “woe is me” attitude. The album is classic Pat Fish, it is packed with his quirky dry sense of humour and pathos, and filled to bursting with his talent for painting vivid and eccentric imagery in his lyrics.
<p />
Sense of Reminiscence
The album opens with a touching sense of reminiscence on the smoky late night jazz bar feel of Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar. It is a perfect illustration of the points made above without ever sounding dewy-eyed or contrived.
<p />
The second song and single, Time, was released around the the same time as Pat’s death, the lyrics really hitting hard then, and they haven’t lost their impact or poignancy over, well, time…
<p />
“My hair’s all wrong. My time ain’t long.
Fishy go to heaven, get along, get along.
I’m having too much fun to get anything done.
Leave me be. I’m not hurting anyone.”
<p />
Irascible Form
With the songs on The Highest in the Land, Pat had hit a seam of gold in his songwriting. He was on top irascible form. Only he could come up with a lyric like “Existential threats pile up like mashed potato snow around my door, they say that fears a mans best friends, and every day it seems like I have more” on Running on Fumes. The song sounds like an upbeat caper but in actuality is a tetchy observation of the state of affairs in a post Brexit, COVID hit Britain where we’re all running on fumes.
<p />
The penultimate song, Sebastian’s Medication, is a hilarious romp making barbed digs at everything from gammons to political correctness, keyboard warriors and politicians. Still, the lyrics carry a sense of poignancy “you ain’t gonna get me just yet…no”.
<p />
Goodnight
The final song is the utterly beautiful Goodnight Sweetheart. Softly brushed drums and elegantly played guitar soundtrack the poignant nod heartfelt lyric. Pat’s last word on the album is “Goodnight”. It is delivered in such a manner that it leaves you totally bereft and emotionally drained.
<p />
This is an undoubtedly beautiful album. Given the lyrics and the circumstances of its release, it is often a difficult listen. Over time though (there is that word again), like the aforementioned Blackstar and You Want it Darker?, I’m sure these songs will be savoured and  this album enjoyed as one of the most special of releases in The Jazz Butcher catalogue.
<p />
RIP Pat, I hope you found Lot 49..

For devoted, longtime fans of Pat Fish (a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher), The Highest In The Land could be a difficult listen, as the brilliant, occasionally eccentric but always entertaining British singer/songwriter died of a heart attack in October at 63. It’s a treat to have another Butcher outing—the first since 2012’s The Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers—but spins of this final LP are almost unbearably sad in spots.
<p />
The Highest In The Land’s nine songs were penned over a seven-year period, part of which saw Fish undergo cancer treatment. He was free of the disease during recording, but the subject of mortality permeates the proceedings. Of course, this is said with the knowledge of Fish’s untimely demise; maybe if he were still alive, lyrics like “My time ain’t long/Fishy go to heaven, get along, get along” (from the nearly funky “Time”) would be heard in a different light, as the Butcher addressed death many times over his roughly 40-year career.
<p />
Or maybe if this was his latest outing and not his last, the closing, elegiac “Goodnight Sweatheart” wouldn’t hit so hard: “Here we are, where life became impossible/We want to be handled softly, kissed and told that we’re worth something.” (Cue the waterworks when Fish quietly says, “Goodnight,” at the song’s conclusion.) Fairly subdued musically, The Highest In The Land isn’t all doom and gloom. Fish’s always sharp sense of humor remained intact, with funny and insightful moments like “Running On Fumes” and “Sebastian’s Medication” shining just as brightly as the poignant ones.
<p />
Most of the aforementioned aficionados will feel that The Highest In The Land stands with the best of the Butcher’s catalog; it may be too soon to fully cop to that, but that’s only because the bar is so damn high. Either way, it serves as a beautiful epitaph for a great, underrated artist gone far too soon, and that’s reason enough to celebrate its existence even as we mourn the passing of its creator.

This is the second appreciation I’ve written about a dead musical hero. The first, for guitar-pop legend Tommy Keene, came easily in some respects. We were friends, and while his 2017 death was a shocking gut punch from which I’ve not fully recovered, it wasn’t difficult to quickly express the depth of that loss.
<p />
Patrick Huntrods, a.k.a. Pat Fish—whose rock ’n’ roll nom de plume was the Jazz Butcher—died October 5 at the too-young age of 63 of a heart attack. I’d seen him play three times, twice at the old 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., where backstage security was nonexistent, but I never did meet him. Who this fabulously talented British singer/songwriter was as a person is beyond me, though given his obvious intelligence and wit, he was a likely a fine chap.
<p />
What I can offer about him is that from 1983-2000, the prolific Butcher released 11 LPs (as well as various compilations, live records and numerous singles) and another, The Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers, in 2012. Describing his sometimes quirky, always distinctive songs—and why they continue to resonate—is tricky. (This is an unfortunate shortcoming for a music writer, so bear with me.)
<p />
Much of the Butcher’s early output tended toward silliness like “Love Kittens” (“Love kittens, ’cause kittens aren’t horrible”) from 1983 debut In Bath Of Bacon or absurdist drones like “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present” from 1984’s A Scandal In Bohemia, but all of it was couched in enough melody as to not be completely inscrutable. Even then, and especially later, he was equally adept at heartrending tales of romantic angst (like “Angels,” from 1986’s Distressed Gentlefolk, and pretty much the entirety of 1991’s Condition Blue).
<p />
Those first few records are essential, but the Butcher reached his creative peak during the five-album run that started with Distressed Gentlefolk and ended with Condition Blue. 1988’s Fishcotheque, 1989’s Big Planet, Scarey Planet and 1990’s Cult Of The Basement complete the quintet and stand with the best LPs of that era; Fishcotheque, in particular, is possibly the perfect distillation of the Butcher’s brilliance. No one else could write an anti-chicken-consumption rap/rant like “The Best Way” (“There’s chicken on your shirtfront, greasy and thick/Someone tell the manager the chicken is sick/The whole idea’s sick”) and a jangly, melancholic closer like “Keeping The Curtains Closed (“He just stood there at the bus stop at the back of the line/And there were too many people, there was not enough time/And now he’s keeping the curtains closed”).
<p />
The Butcher followed those efforts with two underheard and underrated records (which really describes his entire catalog), 1993’s Waiting For The Love Bus and 1995’s Illuminate. 2000’s Rotten Soul found him reunited with drinking partner/guitarist Max Eider, who left the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy after Distressed Gentlefolk; it’s decent, but the aforementioned The Last Of The Gentleman Adventurers is even better and a welcome return after too long of an absence.
<p />
An old pal, one whom I can thank publicly here for introducing me to his music—props, G.W.—asked me in late September if I’d thought about interviewing the Butcher about the upcoming collection, Dr Cholmondley Repents: A​-​Sides, B​-​Sides And Seasides (Fire). I had to admit that the idea of talking to him gave me pause—could I keep it together without fawning?—but I decided I’d do it and made a note to contact his publicist.

After 13 proper albums, 3 EPs, 3 Live albums, and 13 compilation releases, the group’s 14th, and posthumous release after the death of Pat Fish, The Highest In The Land (Tapete Records), closes the history of The Jazz Butcher’s extensive 40-year career. What was with the final opus for the group, leaves a remarkable collection of songs filled with jangly pop numbers, hints of jazzy swing & blues, monosyllabic deliveries, and odd bouncy & see-sawing jaunts, not always at the same time. There’s a great deal of beauty strewn across the release, but it’s the sprawling “Sea Madness,” with horns gently fitted within, and jangly guitars that’s inviting with Pat Fish’s soft voice caressing through these calm waters. It’s easy to fall in love with how masterfully soothing the track is. It’s moments like this, and on “Never Give Up” that are able to cover listeners in a blanket of delightfulness around airy guitars, slides, and delicateness.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher is obviously far from being a one-trick pony though, and “Melanie Hargraeves’ Father’s Jaguar” can attest. Here the band takes Squirrel Nut Zippers-like movements while still remaining as Butchery as it ever was. The canned horns, gypsy jazz chords, and backing vocals allow for its 1930’s era moment while keeping a firm footing in the present. The lament of “Goodnight Sweetheart” is something that’s easily felt here with Pat Fish’s soft delivery offering his final fare thee well moment. The soft brush-on-drum is appealing, fitting its theme. It is drenched in melancholia and the emotions are felt with his words.
<p />
Music lost a great artist in Pat Fish and while The Highest In The Land marks the band’s finality, we can always refer back to a stunning catalog of music that will live throughout time itself.

The Highest In The Land is the final album by The Jazz Butcher that was completed just before Pat Fish kept his promise, to never quit anything for another few years in the Sunshine Home, as he left us falling asleep at home at Fishy Mansions while waiting for his coffee to brew. His passing has hit me harder than almost any other musician, mainly as over the years Pat had become a good friend and was always cool to hang out and chat with, both at his own gigs and when I'd run into him at John Cale shows or the Big Star tribute show where he was one row behind me and was totally made up when Ray Davies came on to sing Till The End Of The Night.
<p />
Going back to the first time I met and spoke to Pat at Le Troupeau in Paris, at his first four Solo shows, two sets a night the 6th and 7th April in 1989 in a fabulous cellar bar, we got talking between sets and afterwards about music and travel and all sorts of other things. During the chat Pat suggested that I should join his publicity team, also to make sure I kept all the music papers and fliers I was talking about that had to go on some future computer thing, a promise I have more than made good on.
<p />
A week later The Jazz Butcher were playing at The Marquee on the 12th and I ran into Pat before he went on, he then introduced me to his label boss at the time Alan McGee, so he could get me onto the Promo team. Well Alan reacted in the same way he has reacted every time since, when any other friends introduce me to him, by replying "It's you, you tried to kill me!" and walking off or closing the conversation. Pat's jaw hit the floor suitably, I didn't quite know how to reply to that, other than saying sorry for the rather scary late night cab ride I had given Alan a few weeks earlier. Taking him back to his swanky Isle Of Dogs apartment, being new to the job I was rushing everywhere full pelt like a speed freak maniac, we had a close shave that Alan couldn't forgive me for, so my job on team Fishy had gone. Still it hasn't stopped me writing reviews and helping promote Pat ever since and I will miss adding more Live reviews of Pat and whoever is in the Jazz Butcher at the time, almost as much as I'll miss getting more albums by him.
<p />
The album opens with live favorite Melanie Hargreaves Fathers Jaguar that has a real Slim and Slam style beat and shuffle for this wonderful story of what happened to that car and how it affected Melanie's father, when it went up in smoke, as the tune is adorned with some lovely mute trumpet and a very pretty acoustic guitar part, this is sophisticated and nicely jazzy with the call and response part having the merest echo of Cab Calloway.
<p />
Time is Pat's thoughts on his upcoming demise, over a dubby backbeat, as he makes sure we all know he ain't changing and while he's still around he'll have Time for you. Well as he was commenting on my facebook status' two days before he died, I know that's the truth. As Pat freestyles about how kids are working down mines and making Tik Tok videos, as that ever precious commodity Time is running out for him, but not before he completed this album or made sure this song had a great guitar solo.
<p />
Sea Madness is Pat's take on the madness of Brexit or wanting to leave the EU and the idiots who made the process as bad as they possibly could, as Pat was always more of a European Bon Viveur than English fop. As the rather redolent trumpet solo keeps things nicely downbeat as Pat has returned on the Eurostar to St Pancras one last time.
<p />
Never Give Up opens with some sparkling acoustic guitar before Pat tells us repeatedly to Never Give Up in the same way he never gave up drinking or smoking or any of his other habits just for a few years in some dreadful hospice or care home. Instead, Pat tells us to embrace our dysfunction and be ourselves, it also makes me want to see evidence of Pat driving monster trucks. As Pat mentions it not being Condition Blue a line that caught me out in a live review a couple of years ago when he first played this song live. Thankfully Pat never gave up till the end.
<p />
Amalfi Coast May 1963 has a lush summery feel to it, as if it could be Pat's very own Summer Holiday, or could have come from the soundtrack to one of those TV shows that were on in the school holidays it's a rather wonderful instrumental.
<p />
Running On Fumes nicely sums up how exhausted everyone has felt in the last few years at how things have been headed that has only become more apparent in the last couple of years as he invited everyone he hates to a party. As he wants to make his own entertainment with Mackie Messer and others as he feels he is distracted as much as everyone else is while trying to avoid all the toxicity.
<p />
The albums title track The Highest In The Land is a slow careful song about spirituality and how he has been a Monk since he was 8 years old, like some English Dalai Lama as this slowly unfolds I just want to be sitting in a pub garden with Pat as the smoke is passed around once more and we all try once more to be the Highest In The Land, but really Pat often really did seem to be that high both before and after performances as this becomes a blues shout out to Black Raoul and all sorts of other cats that had crossed Pat's path on his way to The Highest In The Land.
<p />
Sebastian's Medication has a distinctly Syd Barrettesque feel to it, even as it switches from being a song of need for medicine, into a bile ridden song of despair at the mess of Brexit, the Gammons in charge of the whole shitshow, with the psych freak out guitars screaming like some troll in his basement, Pat is still riled up about political correctness as he always was from the first time we spoke back in 1989. This is a truly brilliant indictment of our times.
<p />
Goodnight Sweetheart is the perfect passing shot and goodbye to all of Pat's friends and family from Pat to all of us who have known him and seen him around for all these magnificent years. This is Pats own eulogy to his life and career and is a real tearjerker, as I have over 35 years of memories and friendship with Pat to recall, as he sings Goodnight Sweetheart over and over like he is saying it to everyone who called him a friend and who he knew by name, when he says good night one last time at the end of the album it really is his last good night to us all and what a shame we won't be able to have any more Good Nights with Pat. But I am thankful for all the wonderful times Pat was a part of.

Those of us who knew, knew, and there are many of us, scattered the length and breadth of the island and way beyond, for whom The Jazz Butcher has been a bright, sweet, brilliantly acerbic presence many a long year. The Highest In The Land is a fine encomium and - it hurts to write this, a little - epitaph for Northampton's foremost gentleman and indie bard. If you're new to Pat and his work or had a velleity and have never quite scratched the surface, The Highest In The Land is a rather good place to start; no artist in waning tailspin, here, just the man himself on fine form. Cheers Pat. Let's hope you've swapped the bus lane for something deservedly grander, with your chosen deity supplying you with a vintage Gretsch or three and your own personal cloud. You? You were bloody lovely.

It’s only a matter of months since Pat Fish slipped out of life, and just the idea of that remains difficult to grasp. I’d been about to text my brother about this fellow doing The Thunderbolt on Thursday you should go and see, and suddenly ‘this fellow’ wasn’t here any more. I wondered then about the recordings; having seen Facebook postings about the sessions in the summer; and it seems both a near-miracle and a benison how quickly they’ve arrived with us.
<p />
The greater benison though is what an extraordinary record he has left behind. Across nine songs and thirty-five minutes there is so much variety, wit, and invention, together with quite splendid settings and virtuoso contributions. Both a musical and lyrical delight it captivates and entrances; as the songs become more familiar so too do the echoes they contain and the depths of meaning.
<p />
The Highest In The Land was recorded at Dulcitone Studios, a converted chapel in rural Northamptonshire. Lee Russell produced and played keyboards, joined by drummer Dave Morgan and bassist Tim Harries, and various guests including Pat’s longtime collaborator Max Eider. Pat had declared this to be his last recording, and some songs definitely confirm that, but this is anything but a quiet goodbye as I would confidently predict this album’s reputation will only gain stature over the coming weeks, months, and years.
<p />
Pat was a European – he’s pictured on the album cover having a quick fag outside the Gare du Nord – so it’s entirely fitting the opener, ‘Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar’ initially sets us down in a Parisian dive bar. The jaunty jazz swing however quickly dances us out of time and spins us a tall tale, or recounts a dream, in which a lilac Jaguar, which isn’t really a Jaguar, immolates on Formby Beach. There’s some delightful trumpet courtesy of Simon Taylor, some brief call and response, and an abiding suspicion of this being a shaggy dog story to cover an escape.
<p />
In real life that escape is only to one place and ‘Time’ addresses it; there’s auspiciousness in the title and its inevitable echo of the Bowie song. “My hair’s all wrong / My time ain’t long / Fishy go to Heaven, get along, get along” sung to a ticking-clock beat, is as stark as it gets anywhere; haunted, a mite unnerving, relentless yet restrained and a genuine anger – some quite angry guitar – about lithium mining, before the bravado of “one more shot for Davy Jones”.
<p />
Then reverie and near-nostalgia; ‘Sea Madness’ is something of a lament for a Turkish friend, to the memory of Ankara girls, to nights in Paris. The trumpet here carries a profound melancholy but it’s clearly not just personal as the title’s doing double-duty with its gentle punning; “sea madness in the middle of England’s sadness”; and is there, on an album not short of resonances, deep-down an emotional kinship to ‘A Song For Europe’? Echoes present too in ‘Never Give Up’; at the least David J and Bob Dylan have cameos in this delightful benediction, full of the questions we go on asking for a lifetime. Until perhaps that morning when it just seems as well to be off, drifting into a dreamy fantasia of an imagined past soundtracked by ‘Amalfi Coast May 1963’.
<p />
Except not yet while ‘Running On Fumes’ remains an option. To the tune of ‘Lily Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts’ comes another lyrical tour de force; Lemmy and Bowie and Prince may all be gone but the Butcher remains and the words cascade brilliantly; “When I said we could be ghosts I didn’t mean for you to disappear on me/well I hope you’re feeling better, that your life is all you wanted it to be”; until they falter because you may be running on fumes but every so often you have to stop and catch your breath.
<p />
Fresh wind attained, the title track comes full of slightly detached braggadocio, as Pat becomes the East Midlands equivalent of a Chicago bluesman, delivering boasts, repetitions, and declarations; “Goin’ to read my bible/goin’ to study my Koran”; over a shuffle enhanced by haunting guitar and keyboards. Then ‘Sebastian’s Medication’ takes another turn, back to the seventies, and what suggests a cross between Syd Barrett and Squeeze, invoking Children Of The Stones and ‘Kung Fu Fighting’, but turns into a lambast of Brexiteer gammons and keyboard warriors accompanied by increasingly wild and mighty guitar from Joe Woolley.
<p />
“You ain’t goin’ to get me just yet”; but soon enough for he and Little Jake (like Black Raoul a cat) to be making a reckoning and set it down in the beautiful valedictory ‘Goodnight Sweetheart’ where you sense this suave, slightly down-at-heel dandy having one last drag, remembering fondly “Museum Street on Halloween”, and noting finally that life comes down to wanting “to be handled softly, kissed and told we’re worth something”, before he signs off.
<p />
It’s sad we’ll now never hear these songs played live – he performs some of them on The Fishy Mansions Sessions viewable at jazzbutcher.com – but across the span of The Highest In The Land he remains so with us, and as these songs unfold, spurring ideas, spinning tangents, and simply delighting, a conversation continues. For any artist that’s no small legacy, and as good a consolation as we get to take.
<p />
The Highest In The Land is available now on Tapete Records. The in-studio photo was taken by Ruth Tidmarsh who also created the ‘Running On Fumes’ video.

Thanks to high profile efforts by Warren Zevon and David Bowie, it’s not unusual to hear records made by artists who know their times are limited. Add to that list The Highest in the Land, the final effort from Pat Fish, AKA the Jazz Butcher. Though he was free of the cancer he’d been fighting for years by that point, Fish knew he was nearing the end as he finished his twelfth studio album, and made sure he left a hell of a legacy behind.
<p />
The record begins with “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar,” the type of perfectly delectable tongue-twisting guitar pop expected from Fish and his cohorts (which include his original axe-slinging sidekick Max Eider). The impressionistic title track continues the streak along the same lines, while the instrumental “Amalfi Coast May 1963” keeps tongue slightly in cheek with its evocation of sixties-style interlude music. Of course, there’s more here than mere whimsy. The folky “Sea Madness” pays loving tribute to a Turkish immigrant, while the rollicking “Sebastian’s Medication” and the countrified “Running On Fumes” turn his sharply observant eye toward Brexit (and finds it wanting).
<p />
But where the album really shines is when Fish contemplates the end of the road. “My hair’s all wrong/My time ain’t long/Fishie go to heaven get along get along” he sings with a sardonic joie de vivre on “Time,” refusing to let his sense of humor abandon him. The line “How can anyone ever be ready for years?” indicates the truth wears on him in “Never Give Up,” which also includes the plea “I would tear my stupid life in two/To have an hour alone with you.” A glimmer of hope shines on that couplet, though, as it’s followed by “You said, ‘That might be arranged.’” The melodies refuse to let the light dim.
<p />
The record ends with the gorgeous “Goodnight Sweetheart,” which explores the gray area between disappointment and beauty. “We want to be handled softly, kissed, and told that we’re worth something,” Fish sings, before ending with the repeated invocation of the title. It’s impossible not to be moved by this lovely conclusion to the recording career of a remarkable songwriter. You just want to reach out, touch Fish’s shoulder and reassure him that, as made clear by The Highest in the Land, he’s worth everything.

The Highest In The Land is a difficult album to review. Pat Fish, who started the band and was in essence, The Jazz Butcher, passed away, quite suddenly on October 5, 2021. When an album is released following such a death, it is difficult to listen and assess the album without the shadow of the artist’s passing hanging over the album.
<p />
Fish had been working on this album over the past couple of years, and it was his first studio album since 2013’s Last of The Gentleman Adventurers. It is classic Jazz Butcher. Fish always had a way of turning a phrase and writing remarkably melodic and joyful music. Sometimes the lyrics don’t match the ‘up’ feeling of the music but Fish had the knack for matching poignant lyrics with pop/bouncing music.
<p />
Lyrically, this is Fish at his best. HeFish could always write lines that bring a smile and are a bit painful at the same time, such as in  “Running On Fumes” . “When I said we could be ghosts/I didn’t mean for you to disappear on me.” Only Fish could come up with that sentiment.
<p />
As good as the lyrics are on the album, the one instrumental is quite impressive as well. “Amalfi Coast, May 1963” tugs at your heartstrings with its utter beauty. It is emotionally expressive without one word being uttered. It also highlights his instrumentation and skill on the guitar and his ability to arrange music.  It is easy to overlook Fish’s musical abilities, which is sad because his musicianship is quite distinct and unique. And although it is a short, it packs a power punch.
<p />
The Highest In The Land  ends with the stunning “Goodnight Sweetheart”, a phenomenal song and a moving track. He jams so much into the lyrics that it reads as a standalone poem. Along with “Never Give Up”, it is one of the best songs Fish ever produced.
<p />
Reviewing new music by an artist who has passed away is difficult. Pretending that this is not his final statement to the world helps to listen it a little more objectively. Having said that, it isn’t a stretch to say that The Highest in The Land stands as one of the best Jazz Butcher albums. It is a shame that there is an almost 10-year gap between this and the last one, as I would have loved to have more music from Pat Fish and company, but this is what we have and it is wonderful to have it.

T-BONES: How did you get started writing songs? Was there a song you heard and thought - “I can do that too!”
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: You can be hearing the most wonderful music in your head, but if, like me, you can’t write music, then inevitably you can only write what you can pick out on a guitar or a piano or whatever. I was particularly handicapped in this department as a youth because I could only play the flute and the tenor sax, which are hardly great composing tools. Only one note at a time, you understand.  In the summer of ’81 I heard a surprise 7” release by Velvet Underground drummer Mo Tucker. She had banged out a version of the old classic “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?”, using multitrack recording to play everything herself. I thought, “Well, if Mo can make a record all by herself with some pretty rudimentary skills, perhaps I could manage it too one day.”
<p />
It was that kind of thinking that led me to learn a bit of guitar, and, from there, the songs came. Because I knew not what I was doing, any riff or chord sequence, however basic, felt like magic to me. I was blessed with a twin deck ghetto blaster which had a wonderful design fault: when you copied a cassette, the internal mics
remained open. Having discovered this by accident, I realised that I could bounce between two cassettes to build up primitive little arrangements on tape. In a dismal, lonely three-month spell living in a village at the start of ’82, my silly experiments started to turn into the songs that you can hear on our first album, Bath of Bacon.
So it was a question of process and methodology, rather than any fancy “inspiration.” I followed my nose, made up silly words because I never for a moment thought that anybody other than my closest friends would ever hear this stuff. I kept in mind Eno’s axiom about working within your limitations and I always remembered Mo as well. I
owe her a lot.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: During the years on Glass Records, you seem to be trying everything you can out. Was songwriting and recording in the beginning this sort of “land of opportunity” for you?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: I think it’s fair to say that, yes. The recording studio was a great adventure, nothing was off-limits. We were lucky enough to be learning on the job, so, of course, we made a few “schoolboy errors” along the way.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: In 1986, your music makes the American transition to Big Time (distributed by the major-label RCA,) how did that feel to suddenly find listeners and even fledgling Alternative and College Radio support over here?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: We spent most of ’85 on the road in Europe, so we were already used to a certain low level of media interest: radio, TV, and so forth. Well into ’86, however, it never crossed our minds that we would ever go and play in America. That seemed unimaginable. When Dave Barker, the boss of Glass Records, told us that we were
going to play there, we didn’t really believe him.
<p />
We arrived in New York in the middle of the CMJ conference. It was only when we got there that we discovered that we were in the top ten on the various independent charts of the time. We were entirely unready. “What’s a station ID?” I would say to the legions of trendy young things with fancy recording gear who seemed to pop up
everywhere in our path. It got worse in Canada. Nobody had told us, but we were on a major label up there. I found out when somebody handed me a sheet of paper with “Mercury” printed at the top and an interview schedule that began at 9:00 am.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: It all seems to come together when you move to the greener pastures of Creation. “Fishcotheque” builds on “Sex and Travel” while revealing that you are never devoting yourself to one “style” of music.  
Is it safe to say that the song you wrote was more important than meeting any similarities to the songs of that period?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: Both Dave Barker at Glass and Alan McGee at Creation had sufficient faith in us that there was none of that record company nonsense about trying to make us sound fashionable, or like somebody else successful. They left us to our own devices. There was none of that insidious “You know what we should do?” stuff.
Dave, Alan, and I are interested in making beautiful records rather than “hits.” And sometimes, of course, as Alan has proved, you can do both at once.  Our band had friendships with other bands, most of whom sounded nothing like us, but who shared a certain aesthetic and perspective. We didn’t identify with any kind of “movement” or anything like that. We weren’t trying to make records to cause a stir that week. We were trying to make records that would last the listener a long time, that would repay his or her investment.
<p />
From the second LP on, our production values had as little in common with the rough, cheap, just-learned-to-play “indie” sound as they did with the big, clattery, soulless cocaine sound of the major record company bands. We weren’t fashionable then and we aren’t fashionable now. But you can put just about any of our records on
today and they’re still listenable, still comprehensible to the modern ear. Unlike, for example, Bogshed. But then, if you want to make a record, it helps if you have an actual song, yeah?
<p />
It is possible, of course, to make a classic single more or less by accident in a few frenzied hours in a cheap studio. But something to which people are going to sit down at home and pay attention for half an hour at a time? Give me a break. All the music on Fishcotheque has its roots in Africa. There are obvious things, like
some of the rhythms and the pretty, chiming guitars. And there is also the fact that all the music that we listen to – on our side of the planet, at least - comes from Africa.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: Where did the idea for samples come in? They really make the songs stand out
further from the pack?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
MR. FISH: The biggest influence here was a single by Steinski and Mass Media called “The Motorcade Sped On”, a stunning assemblage of radio commentary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, brilliantly manipulated into something that can only be described as a great pop song. We played that constantly on the tour bus. Long before I even knew that samplers existed, I used to mess about with tape edits.  Late at night in my little music room, I would pull off a particularly nice edit and drunkenly declare myself the Prince of the Pause Button. Out loud.
<p />
By 1986, thanks to Big Audio Dynamite, Public Enemy, and the JAMMS (deranged forerunners of the mighty KLF), we knew that samplers were out there, but we didn’t actually encounter one face-to-face until we made Fishcotheque. You only have to listen to “The Best Way” to know how delighted we were about that.
After that, it was samples all the way. We still used to collect them on cassettes and then feed them into the sampler when we arrived at the studio. By “Condition Blue” I was getting into using musical loops as well, something that developed more and more with Sumosonic and ultimately Wilson. I think that – be they loops or voices – nice, scuzzy samples can add real excitement to a mix. For me, dropping cool samples is as much a part of the recording process as a lead guitar overdub, a backing vocal, or a tambourine, and, well used, it can play just as important a role.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: Now as “Big Planet Scarey Planet” you grab for an intense worldview, the songs all play differently and you draw some great character sketches in your stories like “Bicycle Kid” and “Line of Death”. Was the goal to broaden your horizons and maybe appear more of a storyteller to your new audience?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
MR. FISH: To be honest, I didn’t know that I had a new audience.  We were trying to broaden our horizons, but more in a musical sense. We weren’t very successful, as it goes. The record was made at the start of 1989. We’d been listening to Public Enemy, KRS-1, NWA, DeLa Soul. We were aware of the growing dance scene and not unfamiliar with ecstasy. So we only wanted to make a
psychedelic hip-hop folk-rock protest album for the dancefloor: nothing fancy!
<p />
In the end, we collapsed between a number of stools, so I don’t think the album really works particularly well. The most “old-fashioned” songs came out best, I think; simple pop like Bad Dream Lover or The Good Ones; easy African style tunes like Nightmare Being or, rather more frantically, The Word I was Looking For.  I’ve never really had the knack of story-telling songs. I’ve tried, but it’s usually pretty clunky stuff. I guess Bicycle Kid was a bit of a lucky one-off in that department, but it was based on a real individual, so no imagination was required, happily. I don’t really “do” imagination. I see myself more as a maker of short, noisy documentaries.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: How was that first American tour? Did it influence your writing in ways you could not foresee? Do you still conjure up memories of it when you write today?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: On our first tour in 1986 I think my brain was fully occupied with trying to come to terms with what was happening and cope with the strangeness of it all. We were already familiar with a number of different countries, languages, and cultures, but America and Canada were something entirely new to us. Because we appear to speak the same language (we don’t, of course), a lot of British people think that America is just like a big, hot, prosperous Britain. It’s not. It’s a foreign country and it takes a lot of getting used to. So on that first tour, I wasn’t really up for too much observation; it was more just a question of keeping one’s head above water, getting the job done, and getting out alive.
<p />
Then, of course, came all the other tours. I was a bit more comfortable by then, and I had made some friends “on the ground”, as it were. I was a bit more able to open my eyes and take in what was going on around me. As early as 1989 I had already formulated the idea that all I really did was to observe the weirdness of Americans,
Write it down, set it to music and then sell it back to them. I guess “Hysteria” is a good early example of that. It’s about our experiences on the West Coast on our 1988 tour with Downy Mildew and Alex Chilton. I really did sleep through an earthquake.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: Into the Nineties we go.  What changes from “Scarey” to “Cult of the Basement?” 
You had done ballads before, but “Basement” is somewhat muted compared to the
previous albums. “The Onion Field” is just stunning. For all its ease (and familiarity
with the return of the saxophone) “Daycare Nation” mixes the sardonic with
wistfulness.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: I could easily write a book about the year between the making of “Planet” and “Basement.” Perhaps one day I might. The Second Generation JBC (Paul Mulreany on drums; Laurence O’Keefe on bass; Alex Green on tenor sax; Kizzy O’Callaghan on guitar; and me) had been together for some time now. Tour-hardened, we had developed our own collective personality and style; in marked contrast to the well-intentioned but aimless thrashing-about of “Big Planet.” We had our own vibe now. We didn’t have to try.
<p />
In September ’89, on the way home from a gig in Sheffield, Kizzy went into a fit, which turned out to be a manifestation of a brain tumour! Kiz was hospitalised a week or two before we were due to start a nine-week US/Canadian tour. We were lucky enough to snare our great friend Richard Formby to play guitar on the tour and
by the time we came home, just before Christmas, we were a tight-knit little group, routinely dangerous on stage and almost entirely impenetrable off it. When we left for America in the autumn, Kizzy had had some surgery and seemed in quite good form. We had no doubt that he would be joining the rest of us in the studio to make the next record in early ’90. When he joined us at the studio it was a terrible shock: he was heavily medicated and obviously struggling badly.  We had all been freaking out since Kizzy’s diagnosis, but we had always had faith that he would survive his ordeal. Here, in the studio, in the middle of the countryside in the middle of the winter, we saw what had become of him. Then we started really freaking out.
<p />
So I don’t personally see “Cult of the Basement” as “muted” at all; quite the opposite. For me, it’s a mad, sprawling, scrabbling, desperate thing, simultaneously frightened and belligerent, prone to sudden, unpredictable mood swings. Even the things on it that might normally be expected to pass for humour have a funny eye and a bad attitude.  And, like an old English folk song, things only get worse as it goes along, finishing with Sister Death. What else?
<p />
There was a real “us against the world” feel to the recording sessions, which took place almost entirely in the hours of darkness.  The unassuming little tune “Daycare Nation” is actually one of my favourites. It was cooked up in the studio, inspired by Mulreany just hitting that soft little drum pattern. We got it down in one or two takes, Alex added the three tracks of saxophone, and then, finally, I improvised and honed the lyric. Your estimation of the balance between ”sardonic” and “wistful” strikes me as spot-on. Some of the phrases deployed in the lyric may well have begun as hard-hearted, cynical remarks, but I feel that the context, both sonic and lyrical, pushes those phrases to the point of being almost heart-breaking. And it has a Tube train on it. For me, the sound of a London Tube train is one of the most evocative imaginable. Lonely old men in a vast, uncaring city; that was our theme for this one, and I feel that we gave it a decent shot. We should have programmed it after Mister Odd, though. That, if I’m honest, was a schoolboy error. To make matters worse, I didn’t even spot it until almost thirty years after we made the record! Doh!
<p />
Not long ago I was rather alarmed to realise that this LP has two songs on it about murder. I had never really considered myself homicidal. The Onion Field is that rare thing, a moment where I exercise the thing that passes for my imagination. Rubbish piano by me, deeply disturbing guitar wailing by Richard. I Came fifth in a Nick Cave impressions contest.
<p />
No, but I love “Cult of the Basement”, me. It’s the first record that really captures the sound and spirit of the band at that time. It’s not entertainment; it’s a genuine dispatch from the front line.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: Now we wind up with “Condition Blue” where your whole sound comes full circle. Lyrically, you are putting the pieces back together - which is a beautiful thing. I know there is a lot of emotion wrapped up in this record. Looking back on it now as the end of this sequence, if you will, how do to respond to it today?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: Can I be honest? I think it’s an astonishing record. Everybody thinks their kid is a genius and their cat is the prettiest creature that ever lived, but I genuinely do think this is a proper good record. I still play it in order to try and understand it, and it often catches me out or blows me away, just like a “real” LP by a “real” artist. There are some stellar cameos from the likes of Pete Astor, Peter Crouch, Richard Formby, Joe Allen, Alex Lee, and Sumishta Brahm.
<p />
I didn’t see “Condition Blue” as the end of any sequence at the time; more like the end of the entire fucking universe. But making “Waiting for the Love Bus” some nine months later was a very interesting “Where do we go from here?” sort of challenge, so I guess there is some virtue in seeing things that way. Fortunately, I had Richard Formby there as my producer. He and I see eye to eye on so many things. Moving on into the “space beyond” was a pleasure with Richard at the controls.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: What are your plans for the remainder of 2020, could we see some new songs from
you coming soon?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: My chief objectives for 2020 are to remain alive and solvent. I’ve not really left home since the beginning of March, so I rely on the kindness of strangers to put a dollar or two in the hat when I play one of my little solo sets Live From Fishy Mansions on the Facebook. Those who tune into my little broadcasts will already have heard some new, unrecorded songs. There are more coming along and it’s definitely my intention to make at least one more LP before I hang up my boots. The process is already underway, in fact.
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_q">
T-BONES: Will there be more reissues on the way? Maybe a rarities package or live highlights?
</div>
<p />
<div class="iview_a">
R. FISH: December will see the release of the third Fire Records box set, “Doctor
Cholmondley Repents”, a 4 CD set featuring singles, b-sides, compilation tracks,
demos and a really rather fabulous 45 minute live radio session.
</div>
<p />
Fire Recordings will be releasing “Doctor Cholmondley Repents” on November 12th.

Pat Fish, who performed as The Jazz Butcher for nearly four decades, has died at the age of 64. A post on Pat Fish’s official Facebook page states that the versatile and brilliant musician “died suddenly but peacefully yesterday evening.” On October 3rd, Fish was scheduled to perform a web concert, however at show time, Fish appeared live to inform his audience he was not feeling well and would be re-scheduling the performance for the following week. By means of explanation for his ill health, he offered that he had been suffering from sleep apnea. The cause of death is still unknown, and he had been battling poor health for some time, but his passing has left a major void amongst his friends, loved ones, and the music world.
<blockquote>
“Very sad to announce that my old friend Pat Fish died suddenly but peacefully on Tuesday evening,” said friend and longtime collaborator Max Eider in a statement. “Pat rocked my world in every way and his death leaves a big hole in my life and in my memory, much of which was only stored in his outsized brain. Goodbye mate and thanks for everything. I’m going to miss you.”
</blockquote>
Contemporaries and colleagues The Monochrome Set also paid tribute to their kindred spirit on their Facebook:
<blockquote>
“A wonderful human being…he supported The Monochrome Set at their Tokyo gigs in 2014. He was also due to be a label mate as he’d recently finished recording his first album for Tapete. It’s devastating news.”
</blockquote>
Born Patrick Huntrods in West London, Fish was ” too young to be a hippie and just a little too old to be a punk.” Pat Fish reminisced about growing up in an era where “the Bonzo Dog Band appeared on children’s television, Syd Barrett was on Top of the Pops and the Adult World was represented in shows like The Avengers and The Prisoner.” Fish moved early in his life to Northampton; he went on to study Classics at Merton College, Oxford, graduating in 1980. Oxford didn’t fuel his imagination too much, however, and he ended up traveling down a musical path, forming bands like Nightshift,  The Sonic Tonix, and the Institution, which featured Max Eider on guitar, Rolo McGinty (later of The Woodentops), and Jonathan Stephenson.
<p />
In North America, records like Bloody Nonsense and Distressed Gentlefolk became college radio staples before releasing a series of albums for Creation Records between 1988-1995.
<p />
Taking inspiration less from glam rock and more from Eno, Syd Barrett, John Cale, greaser rock and more obscure 70s artists, The Jazz Butcher debuted in Oxford on 20 February 1982 with Alice Thompson (The Woodentops), Owen Jones, and Max Eider. Fish went on to write and release fifteen albums of original music, three live albums and many singles and compilations, often collaborating with friends. Bauhaus/Love & Rockets bassist David J, members of The Woodentops, Spacemen 3’s Sonic Boom, German band M Walking On The Water, Chelsea Paris, The Black Watch, and Max Eider all lent their talents to his stylings.

Sometime around 1987 I walked into a house in Greenville, North Carolina, where a collection of art students and characters bunked. A band I barely knew, called The Birthday Party, was on the stereo making an unholy racket, and I recall seeing a Scratch Acid album at the top of a stack. I gathered my friend who lived there, an absolutely wonderful artist called Paul Friedrich, had cool housemates who were way into noise rock. Scattered amongst the platters was an LP by a band called The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy. “Wow,” I thought, “a band that butchers jazz? What kind of crazy No Wave outfit is that?” We didn’t listen to it, but JBC was officially on my radar.
<p />
Weeks later I walked into the local record shop and saw a used copy of Distressed Gentlefolk, by the same band. I bought it, headed home, and immediately put it on the turntable.
Imagine my surprise when I heard the first song was a country tune. It wasn’t unusual for bands to go there. Punk and country were sometimes bedfellows, but certainly the next number would good n’ butchered.
Yeah, really butchered, I’ll bet.
Nope, it was pop. Not noise pop, or art pop, just pop. Then a kind of dream pop thing. Then some sort of hand jive situation. To my horror some of the songs were actually… jazz.
Seriously, when the fuck was the butchering going to happen?
<p />
Sometime in the middle of a song about how pets get horny every spring I realized The JBC was, you know, a clever band. I don’t mean that backhandedly, they were genuinely clever. We Americans are often easily charmed by the mad geniuses of the U.K. Robyn Hitchcock, Kevin Ayers, Andy Partridge, Syd, Copey – we can really fall for that stuff, hard, and JBC leader Pat Fish was clearly one of them. He and his bandmate, the shockingly brilliant guitarist Max Eider, churned out lyrics you actually wanted to quote.
<p />
It wasn’t always easy to get Jazz Butcher releases here in the U.S., but luckily I also found a used copy of A Scandal In Bohemia a year later.It marked the first time I’d hear a song living up to the gnarly promise of their name, in “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present.” Bauhaus’ Kevin Haskins and David J. were on this record.
This seemed impossible to me, but also hinted at future discoveries of hard to believe connections.
<p />
I cherished these LPs and listened to them constantly. Through each release, and the personnel changes, I followed what The JBC were doing. I bonded with the person who remains my closest friend, to this day, over Cult of the Basement. I started using “Pat Fish” and “The Jazz Butcher” interchangeably, assuming anyone else playing with him was part of The Conspiracy. I finally got to see the band in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, around the time of Condition Blue. The show was so mind-blowingly good, and it was the first time I had a what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-people-this-band-should-be-huge reaction. The first of many, really.
<p />
As the years rolled on, the legendary status of this man only grew in my mind. He was releasing records on the impossibly cool Creation label. He referenced Pynchon, and obscure films. He wrote a song comparing Mark E. Smith to the pope, and assured us that at least an interminable party is “better than a cold bath with someone you dislike.”  There were the side projects, like arty Black Eg. He was connected to great indie bands like Close Lobsters, The Blue Aeroplanes, and The Woodentops. He hosted TV programs. His band consisted of people with peculiar names like Kizzy, Felix, Pascal, and Dooj. He’d studied at Merton College, Oxford, but also ran around with messy, drugged up miscreants like Spacemen 3, having been an early champion of the band, attending their earliest gigs in the piss-soaked pubs of Rugby. He was good looking, elegant, seemed to be everywhere, and connected to everyone who was cool in indie music. It became clear that Pat Fish was a kind of rock n’ roll Zelig, minus the commonplace part. When Jazz Butcher fans gather, this is often the first thing that comes up. He made smart music that didn’t take itself very seriously, and it was played by the best musicians.
<p />
Heads were always keen to have the departed Max Eider return to the fold, and I finally got to see him play with The JBC at the turn of the millennium. The newly formed Death Cab for Cutie supported on that tour. It seemed correct that some kids who’d named their outfit after a Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band tune would be on the bill. That night was the first time I met Pat, and he was as charming as a fan of the band could have hoped for.
<p />
With the rise of social media The Butcher was able to connect with his admirers in a new way, and it was pretty inspiring to see him out there, doing it, not having gone the way of the rock n’ roll also rans. He was great at sharing remembrances and recounting odd happenings. He did online shows which got a lot of us through the lockdown.
<p />
About seven years ago, after a few pleasant exchanges in a music chat, I got a friend request from Pat, because that’s the era we live in. In another exchange, many years later, I shared with him it had just occurred to me that I’d never bought a new JBC record, only used. They weren’t always easy to find, over here, so the bins were the best bet. Nevertheless, it meant I’d never given Pat a dime, beyond concert tickets and merch. Feeling like the shittiest fan in history, I gave thanks for the online tip jar, and vowed to use it during the online performances. To my delight, other people seemed to as well. There would always be some message from Pat about how generous people had been, and then maybe something about his black cat Raoul. These eventually became a regular Sunday occurrence, billed as Live From Fishy Mansions.
<p />
This past Sunday Pat went live to tell his viewers that he felt like shit, and he just couldn’t play. He seemed truly bothered that he was letting people down, but assured everyone he’d make the show in Bristol, Thursday.
<p />
Two days later he passed.
<p />
Max Eider wrote “very sad to announce that my old friend Pat Fish died suddenly but peacefully on Tuesday evening. Pat rocked my world in every way and his death leaves a big hole in my life and in my memory, much of which was only stored in his outsized brain. Goodbye mate and thanks for everything. I’m going to miss you.”
<p />
Patrick Guy Sibley Huntrods, aka Pat Fish, aka The Jazz Butcher made a lot of people exceedingly happy with his art. He abhorred the fash as much as he adored his cat, and loathed a bigot as much as he loved a pint. He seemed like the kind of guy who would somehow drink and smoke his way to age 97, rather than leaving us at the way too young age of 64.

Pat Fish, best known for performing under the moniker The Jazz Butcher, has died aged 64.
<p />
His death was confirmed by his frequent collaborator and lead guitarist Max Eider, who took to the official Jazz Butcher Facebook page to reveal that Fish died on Tuesday night (October 5). A cause of death has not yet been revealed.
<p />
“Very sad to announce that my old friend Pat Fish died suddenly but peacefully on Tuesday evening,” Eider wrote. “Pat rocked my world in every way and his death leaves a big hole in my life and in my memory, much of which was only stored in his outsized brain.

Born Patrick Huntrods in London in 1957, Fish formed the Jazz Butcher musical project – which has gone under a variation of different names over the years – in 1982 with Eider. His début album, ‘In Bath Of Bacon’, was released by Glass Records in 1983.
<p />
From 1988 through 1995, The Jazz Butcher released a series of albums for Creation Records, including ‘Cult Of The Basement’, ‘Condition Blue’, and their final release for the label, ‘Illuminate’. The Jazz Butcher’s last new release was the 2016 single ‘All The Saints’, released via Fire Records.
<p />
While much of The Jazz Butcher’s catalogue was out of print in the late ’90s and ’00s, Fire began a reissue campaign a few years ago, including the recently announced ‘Dr Cholmondley Repents: A-Sides, B-Sides and Seasides’, which is expected to arrive November 12.

I was deeply saddened this afternoon to learn of the sudden death at the age of 64 of Pat Fish, better known as The Jazz Butcher (“Butch” for short), which was also the name of a band he played in, when they weren’t called The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy or the Sikkorskis from Hell or JBC, and before his later bands Sumosonic and Black Eg and Wilson. The moniker thing was always a tricky bit when discussing the man and his music, especially since even Pat Fish was a pseudonym for the man born Patrick Huntrods in London in 1957. Whatever he was called, and whatever he called whatever he was doing, he was just an absolutely brilliant songwriter, and a charming singer-guitarist with a vast and rewarding studio and live career to his credit.
<p />
Pat Fish attended Oxford University in the late 1970s, and began playing with a collection of local musicians thereabouts, while reading Lit. Hum. at Merton College. A couple of his early collaborators (Rolo McGinty and Alice Thompson) went on to fame and acclaim as members of The Woodentops, while a couple of others (singer-guitarist Max Eider and drummer Owen P. Jones) stayed on with Butch to anchor his most impressive creative period in the 1980s, aided and abetted first by David J (former Bauhaus, later Love and Rockets) and then by Felix Ray on bass. (Note that I am pretty sure Jones is the only one of those core Jazz Butcher Conspiracy musicians whose stage name just might be his real name; I do know all the others’ true monikers, but why complicate things further with that, yeah?)
<p />
The Jazz Butcher’s 1983 debut album, In Bath of Bacon, found the group’s formative line-up in flux, but Fish’s unique blend of smart-to-silly lyrics, interesting instrumentation, and ear-worming sing-along melodies was already in full and fine effect, as were Eider’s exquisite jazz guitar stylings. By the time the second Jazz Butcher album, A Scandal in Bohemia, was released in 1984, the “Me n’ Max n’ Dave n’ Jones” line-up, as Butch name-checked them in the lyrics to the tremendous single “Southern Mark Smith (Big Return),” had cohered and utter madness and magic then spilled out, frequently and ferociously. This is about the time when I jumped aboard the Butcher bandwagon, having heard their song “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present” on Washington’s (then)-great free-form radio station WHFS, which most thoroughly addled and altered my consciousness, making me realize in less than five minutes that I had a new favorite group, right then, right there, right now, and that I had to rush out post-haste and go into deep credit card debt to acquire their entire catalog at extortionate import-level prices. But it was worth it, and then some. Because do you know what happens if you leave a fish too long in an elevator? You don’t? Well, listen to the song for a clue.
<p />
From A Scandal in Bohemia‘s stellar musical platform, the Conspiracy leaped off the high dive and raged on prolifically through a tremendous series of singles, EPs, and albums, culminating with the Distressed Gentlefolk LP in 1986 (Felix had replaced David J on bass by this point) and the related mini-album Conspiracy, credited to The Jazz Butcher vs Max Eider. (In addition to his always scintillating guitar work, Eider generally also wrote and scored a couple of spotlight numbers of his own on each of the Conspiracy’s albums, and they’re often among the group’s finest works). Things seemed to be going swimmingly for the group from the devoted fan’s perspective, and of course that means that the classic Jazz Butcher Conspiracy then immediately blew itself up while on tour supporting Distressed Gentlefolk, with Max Eider departing to pursue a solo career.
<p />
Max’s debut album, The Best Kisser In the World, came out in 1987, and it was a joy to hear and behold. He and Jones also played on some David J records of the period. Pat Fish, for his own next move, left his long-time label home (Glass Records) to sign with Alan McGee’s hugely-influential Creation Records. The first fruits of that new partnership emerged in 1988 when The Butcher released Fishcotheque, featuring Herr Huntrods backed with a new crew of collaborators. I liked it a lot, but I did miss the “Butcher vs Max” dynamic, as on this and (most) subsequent records released under the Jazz Butcher rubric, there was definitely more of a “front man” and “supporting band” vibe to the proceedings than had been the case when Max served as a key foil and co-frontman for the group.
<p />
Fish remained active under the Jazz Butcher persona with a variety of collaborators through the latter part of the 1990s,  at which point he apparently tired of the constraints evoked by that musical brand’s baked-in associations, opting to form and record with the more electronic Sumosonic as a next step forward. But that was to be a short step, as Creation Records dropped the group after their first album. Phooey! And so, at that point, why, and well, and golly, it sure made perfect sense (no, no it didn’t, not really) for an unexpected Butch and Max and Jones reunion that resulted in the delightful Rotten Soul album in 2000, credited once again to The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy. The ever-volatile Max and Pat pair worked together on and off and on and off again over the years following, while Eider’s solo career built strength upon strength with a series of just soul-crushingly brilliant and beautiful records, one of which, Max Eider III: Back In The Bedroom, I named as my Album of the Year for 2007.
<p />
Fish’s post-Conspiracy and post-Sumosonic trajectory then anchored itself around a new band called Wilson, which gigged like champs over the years, and then, time passed, and of course, it once again made perfect sense (no, not really, no it didn’t) for Max and Pat (and Jones on one song) to join forces again for yet another delightfully unexpected album, Last of the Gentlemen Adventurers. That record, released in 2012, was funded through crowd-sourcing, to which I eagerly contributed. As a donor of a certain level, I was offered a meaningful memento from the band, and I asked Max to send a hand-written set of the lyrics to the group’s epic song “D.R.I.N.K.,” personally inscribed to my daughter, Katelin. (Ironically, neither Katelin nor I drink anymore, and the cautionary tale contained in that song is probably as good a reminder as any of why that’s a sound idea. I mean, God forbid we start playing “Sweet Jane” sober, especially with that god-awful “heavenly whine and bullshit” coda that Lou insisted be grafted back onto the song decades after its better original release. Doug Yule was right, in this case, dammit!) (But I digress). Anyway, I just told Katelin about Pat’s passing and she sent me a photo of Max’s kind gift, which I share.
<p />
Anyway. I’m very sad that Pat the Butcher of Oxford and Wilson has flown away from us all on short notice. I knew he’d had some health issues in recent years, but I also knew that he was back gigging as long as the damnable virus let him do so, that he was active with online performances after the pandemic shutdown (he had one scheduled for last Sunday night, which he had to cancel because he was not feeling well), and he’d recently announced that recording of a new Conspiracy album was underway, with Max back in the fold once again. Max’s announcement on the Butcher’s official Facebook page noted that Pat “died suddenly but peacefully on Tuesday evening,” so it wasn’t an expected demise, and 64 years is just way too young to be saying farewell for folks of his capabilities and capacities. In thinking about how to title this post, I elected to use “Only A Rumour,” the title of a gorgeously dark song from 1985’s Sex And Travel, which contains these lyrics: “And how I wish I knew for sure how many years I had before this state I’m in will put me under the ground.” I guess we all wish we knew that, but all I know right now is that Pat didn’t get enough of those years on his tally.
<p />
All of that said, even as I’m very sad to lose an artist who moved me so deeply over the years, I’m also so very happy to have the catalog he left behind, which always makes me smile, so good is it all, and so smart, and sometimes stupid-smart, and other sometimes stupid-stupid, but in the good sense, always fun, always meaningful, always a pleasure, always a joy. The catalog is rich for exploration, but I’ll end this post by appending a special Jazz Butcher edition of my “Five Songs You Need to Hear” Series, featuring a quintet of my favorite Pat Fish numbers. (I’ve already linked to “Caroline Wheeler” and “Southern Mark Smith” and Max’s “D.R.I.N.K.” above, so I’m kinda sorta gonna ignore them and cheat and include five other songs below; consider those bonus cuts above, all of which you also need to hear). RIP Butch. You were one of the great ones.

Patrick Huntrods, better known to his legion of fans as Pat Fish, passed away in October 2021 from a heart attack at the age of 63 years after a career that spanned four decades and resulted in 14 albums.
<p />
The very definition of a “cult artist,” Fish comes from a long and revered line of eccentric British musicians that includes Syd Barrett, Vivian Stanshall, Robyn Hitchcock, and John Otway, among many others. After playing in anonymous bands with names like Nightshift and Sonic Tonix, Fish concocted ‘The Jazz Butcher’ persona in 1982 and carried on with it ever since; much like the original Alice Cooper band, Fish was the Jazz Butcher, and The Jazz Butcher was the band. 
<p />
Although somewhat enigmatic about his past, no biography could beat that which Fish offers on his website: “Born in West London at a time that left him just too young to be a hippie and just a little too old to be a punk, Pat Fish grew up in an era where the Bonzo Dog Band appeared on children’s television, Syd Barrett was on Top of the Pops and the Adult World was represented in shows like The Avengers and The Prisoner. Disappointment was an inevitability.
<p />
Fish failed to ‘get’ the glam rock thing (probably too much of an excitable wee football fan) and found that the seventies drove him down some fairly obscure musical paths before punk rock came along to save the day. By then, however, all those mad little songs by Eno, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen, John Cale, Peter Blegvad and Tony Moore were already locked up in his head.”
<p />
Starting with his 1982 debut, In Birth of Bacon, and right up through his recently released swan song, The Highest In the Land, Fish defied expectations. His band name might change on a whim, from The Jazz Butcher to The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy or The Jazz Butcher and His Sikkorskis From Hell. Fish also fronted bands other bands, outfits like the Black Eg, Sumosonic, and Wilson that all enjoyed various levels of popularity in the U.K. but were virtually ignored stateside. He worked for a while as the host of a music show called Transmission for ITV, dabbled in record production, and collaborated musically with fellow travelers like David J (Love & Rockets), Spacemen 3, David Kusworth (The Jacobites), and The Blue Aeroplanes.
<p />
No matter where his creative muse took him, Fish always circled back around to The Jazz Butcher. Inspired by free-thinking, free-wheeling artists like Bob Dylan, the Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers and Peter Laughner, Fish’s erudite lyrics always displayed the man’s intelligence and unique view of the world, whether he was quoting novelist Thomas Pynchon or writing a tribute to the master of ‘speculative fiction’, Harlan Ellison. You could never tie Fish down, and JB songs were endlessly complex and brimming over with Fish’s witty lyricism and observational sense of humor, often underwritten by constant stylistic changes. One song might be jangle-pop, another a furious punk-rocker, and a third performed in cabaret style, and often on the same album.
<p />
Needless to say, this lack of adherence to a single style or musical direction won Fish few fans in the record biz, and his U.S. audience was never more than a dedicated cult that appreciated his musical risk-taking and high-IQ lyrics. All of which brings us around to the elephant in the room, The Highest In the Land, the final will and testament of Mr. Pat Fish, The Jazz Butcher. A nine-song collection recorded as Fish was undergoing cancer treatment, it was his first album since 2012’s Last of the Gentlemen Adventurers. And sadly, it would be overshadowed by the artist’s own mortality. 
<p />
Fish gathered together an all-star roster of longtime Jazz Butcher collaborators to make The Highest In the Land, including original JB guitarist Max Eider and guitarist Peter Crouch, bassist Tim Harries and drummer Dave Morgan. Working out of Lee Russell’s Dulcitone Studios in rural Northamptonshire, Fish assumed that he was recording his final album and was determined that he would not go quietly into that good night but would instead rage against the dying of the light (my apologies to Dylan Thomas…).
<p />
In the Tapete Records press release for the album, producer Russell says of Fish, “he was not delusional. We all go through life acting like its going to last forever, but that’s a lie, and Pat was cleverer than the rest of us. He actually was facing it. He was in no mood to compromise his life in any way whatsoever…”
<p />
As a result, while the tracklist for The Highest In the Land is, perhaps, a couple of songs too short, it’s also the perfect length for what Fish was trying say with his final musical statement. The album starts with “Melanie Hargreave’s Father’s Jaguar,” a jazzy little stroll through nostalgia that sports wry wordplay and filigree fretwork floating above light-handed brushwork on the cymbals. A muted horn adds to the dreamlike vibe Fish has created with his throwback musical arrangement.
<p />
With “Time,” however, Fish gets down to the nitty gritty of life, crooning slick rhymes that other songwriters would build entire songs around: “my hair’s all wrong, my time ain’t long, Fishy go to heaven, get along, get along;” “I took a long weekend in the psychedelic shack, and when you cross that bridge you ain’t never coming back;” “I’ve got scars and stripes and burns, I’ve got the law of diminishing returns.” 
<p />
The lyrics of “Time” are delivered over a sparse atmospheric soundtrack, Fish’s breathless vox accompanied by a steady rhythmic drumbeat and wiry guitarplay. It wouldn’t be a Jazz Butcher track if he didn’t poke the bear with bit of political polemic, using one verse to jab a sharp verbal stick at child labor, private prisons, and life in an authoritarian regime, ending his magnificent tirade with the line “time’s running out, the money’s running out, you don’t need me to tell you what it’s all about.” With these words, Pat Fish is finished educating his audience; he’s taught us all he’s going to. By contrast, “Sea Madness” is a whimsical, country-flavored pro-immigrant tune written in honor of Turkish George, a longtime fixture on the Northampton music scene.
<p />
The six-string interplay spun from the ether by Eider and Crouch for the highly-personal “Never Give Up” is stunning, matching Fish’s winsome vocals and gentle lyricism, the song’s lilting melody a thing of true beauty. A left-leaning intellectual, Fish began his career in defiance of the Thatcher era and ended it during the despised Boris Johnson years. As such, songs like “Running On Fumes” and “Sebastian’s Medicine” are socially-conscious political diatribes that are both topical and timeless. With a shitkicker country rhythm, the former song delights with lines like “existential threats pile up like mashed potato snow around my door, they say that fear’s a man’s best friend, and every day it seems I have more” as Fish name-checks David Bowie and Motörhead’s Lemmy with his commentary on modern society.
<p />
If “Running On Fumes” brings Blood On the Tracks-era Dylan to mind, then “Sebastian’s Medication” is Fish at his most Dylan-esque, his opaque, word-a-minute lyrics delivered talking blues style above a shuffling rhythm. Criticizing England’s “Brexit” from the European Union and the right-wing propaganda that brought it about, the singer sums up his fellow countrymen’s decision singing “the gammons are all whining for some kind of reclamation but they don’t know what they want to reclaim” above a shadowy guitar riff ringing menacingly in the background. Opening with a mesmerizing guitar line, “The Highest In the Land” gently mocks people’s reliance on pseudo-spirituality and demagoguery, often to their own detriment and well-being. Fish sings “I’ve been a monk since I was eight years old, don’t want your money baby, don’t want your gold” while tying the worship of false idols to the isolationism currently embraced by too many Brits.  
<p />
Closing out The Highest In the Land, “Goodnight Sweetheart” is another personal ode, a low-key ballad reminiscent of Nick Lowe, with shimmering guitars and sparse percussion, the song instead relying on Fish’s unique, crooning vocals to carry the slight melody. Although it may seem like a downbeat tune to finish the album, it’s actually a lovely reminder of the concepts like love and friendship that fueled Fish’s entire existence.
<p />
It may be a somber goodbye, but it’s delivered with the quiet fury of a man that’s said all he’s had to say. As final statements go, The Highest In the Land is right up there with Warren Zevon’s The Wind , Johnny Cash’s American IV, and Bowie’s Blackstar as artistic triumphs.
<p />
Mr. Fish will certainly be missed, but he left us one last loving missive in The Highest In the Land.

Con el estigma de ser un músico considerado excéntrico, Pat Fish ha estado involucrado en el proyecto de Jazz Butcher desde principios de los 80 siendo, eso sí, una rara avis de aquella generación, por sus evidentes influencias de Velvet Underground, Modern Lovers o Dylan. Esa supuesta excentricidad no es sino una forma de escapismo de las corrientes sonoras que marcaron aquellos años y de las que Pat se escurría con elegancia.
<p />
Como músico inquieto ha sabido establecer unos parámetros que caminan con los años, cambiando su agresividad juvenil por un semblante más reposado, con el uso de contrabajo y sección de viento, escobillas en la batería y un tono relajado en sus interpretaciones.
<p />
Su último concierto en nuestro país se produjo celebrando los 25 años del programa de radio que presento y dirijo, Los 39 Sonidos, disponible en www.juanvitoria.com, por ello fue una actuación pensada para dejarse llevar por un público poco numeroso, pero expectante y deseoso de conectar con este nuevo formato. Con algunas proposiciones extraídas de su más reciente trabajo, “Last Of The Gentlemen Adventurers” y gotas de su trayectoria pasada, la combinación de trompeta, pedales de efectos, guitarra acústica y la sobriedad vocal que le caracteriza, Pat nos trajo una bluesy “Southen Mark Smith”, radicalmente opuesta al nervio original del tema, aunque sí mostró lo impecable de canciones que fueron tratadas casi al igual que hace treinta años, caso de “Partytime”. Momentos álgidos como la francófona “Tombé dans les pommes” y las sorpresivas versiones del “All Along The Wachtower” dylaniana, fundida con “Free Money” de Patti Smith o una contagiosa “Gloria” de Them, constataban la sabiduría que sobre un escenario tiene este hombre, curtido en mil noches frente a concurrencias dispares a las que nunca ha temido.
<p />
Decir que Jazz Butcher es un genio incomprendido no es un recurso fácil; compararlo con personajes como Kevin Ayers o Syd Barrett tampoco es una perogrullada; lo que sí está claro es que es un creador con una versatilidad aplastante, que se mueve en todos los terrenos con brío y sin titubear, que engancha desde la primera nota y que atrapa a la audiencia con una velocidad inusitada. Todos sabemos que faltaron algunas canciones que eran emblema de esos “otros 80’s”, pero no se notó en absoluto, ya que las composiciones elegidas nos manejaban por los caminos que él había preparado y constataban la brillantez en la composición de todo un personaje encantadoramente maldito del pop británico, con muchos matices loureedianos.
<p />
Al día siguiente, para celebrar el día de las tiendas de discos especializadas en todo el mundo, Pat tomó su guitarra y a su trompetista y se marcó un mini concierto entrañable en Discos Amsterdam, con alguna otra adaptación inesperada, como “Take The Skinheads Bowling” de Camper Van Beethoven.
<p />
A Pat Fish hay que quererle por lo que tiene de significado su música, la libertad de no claudicar ante modas o condicionantes, el talento que derrocha cada vez que contacta con las cuerdas de una guitarra o, incluso, cuando suspira. Y suspira de maravilla, es lo que tienen los genios.

To help his recovery Will Carruthers formerly of Spacemen 3 and Spiritualized has launched a Go Fund Me campaign to help raise funds to cover expenses for his recuperation.
<p />
The Go Fund Me page states:
<div class="annotation">
“Pat Fish, aka. Mr Jazz Butcher, aka.  The Almost Abstemious Bohemian Godfather of the New Barcelona, NN1 Northampton has been unwell. This will come as a bit of a shock to those of you who may have thought that he was always slightly unwell, which is just a matter of opinion anyway.
<p />
“Fishy’s recent bout of unwellness has NOT, unfortunately,  been  a matter of opinion .”
<p />
“Despite his recent brush with inconvenient unwellness, Pat  has, unsurprisingly, remained Fishily stoic throughout. Perhaps a little too stoic. He hardly told a soul about it all. But then, as he himself  said, “Sure, what else is there to do of a January and February but go to the radiology department anyway?” 
<p />
“I suppose at this point I should start reassuring some of you that Pat does seem to have seen off the reaper this time, and he has been responding well to treatment. He remains “Cautiously optimistic.” “
<p />
“Pat is a musician and, consequently he is a little on the light side of comfortably off sometimes. Understandably, this is one of those times. It’s kind of difficult to hit the stage and entertain the people when there are medical necessities that need attending to. “
<p />
“Pat has asked me to point out that this fundraiser is not to pay for his actual medical treatment, (though recovery might be said to be a large part pf treatment), because, thankfully, we live in a country in which it is not always necessary to sell one of your kidneys to afford the medicine to make the other kidney better. We have free healthcare, and the very fine people at  Northampton hospital have been doing their utmost to keep the Butcher, butchering, which is how we like him .”

I've been trying to write an entry for days, looking for the notes to associate a few words with and there was no way. I didn't notice "Nothing special".  A gap, lack of inspiration. That strange feeling that you notice the day you realize that something ( a hobby, a reading, a song, a person ) that moved you hard, that turned your heart around, it doesn't mean anything anymore.  He was beginning to be worried.
<p />
I had a lot of words and songs gathered in skeins, accumulated, but every time I pulled the thread it ran aground... "Nothing special". That's what I thought and it sounded on the iPod "Angels" of the "Jazz Butcher" and I realized that was the entry that was looking for me.
<p />
The Jazz Butchers are an English group from the eighties that had limited success. Probably because they never believed their musical line and that lack of self-esteem took away their possibilities. Chances are his style would have fitted better into current "indie" music ( By the way! ¿What style is this? ) than in the postpunk era.
<p />
I do not know if my interpretation is true but I have the feeling that they lacked support from all sides: from their audience, from the record companies and of course from themselves. It is even noticeable in the name of the group that has had up to three denominations: "The Jazz Butcher" with dry stick or adding "Conspiracy" or "And His Sikkorskis from Hell" ( Wikipedia dixit ). Their website lacks frills, although they continue to update it and continue to act.
<p />
"Disstressed gentlefolk" is the first album ( although it is the fourth ) that was released from them in Spain in 1986, and we bought it immediately. I do not know why. I'm sure he hadn't heard a song. It is possible that this cover with the drawing of a well-dressed man, tied to a beautiful woman in the rump of a horse hoisted by some wicked, riding in the direction of an abyss, it would influence it. That comic image is still very attractive to me and I like to look at it gawking while it sounds on the turntable.
<p />
Curious the title of the album that refers to a British NGO from the end of the 19th century and that is still active today. Surely it is a wink from the leader ( Pat Fish, The Butcher ) who, given the humorous tone of one of his lyrics, would say that he is horny.
<p />
Production is simple, without fuss, or excesses. Surely for lack of means, but enough to make a glimpse of young people trying to organize their ideas, hesitant, looking for their place in the world, wanting to have fun and have fun. It seems that they did too much because they fought ( "The Zurich Incident" ) and that meant the departure of the guitarist's band, vocalist and composer Max Eider who continued solo with some interesting proposal. It seems that over the years something was arranged and they have collaborated together occasionally.
<p />
The group continued with what is probably their best album: "Fishcoteque". A pun with the last name of the main component. Already characterized, by a more defined musical style with clearly pop trends and probably something more commercial.
<p />

"Falling in love" starts the album. A tune with a folk air. Vocal harmonies to cheer friends, even without music, when they leave. A start to optimistic rhythms although "There's a real bad case of too much falling in love".
<p />
It is followed by "Big bad thing" which persists in the rhythmic good humor despite the title, although with a style clearly different from the first, they sound a bit "punk". Those beers must be starting to take effect.
<p />

In "Still in the kitchen" they find their most characteristic sound and will then explode on their other records. It starts slow, just like a ballad, the guitars sound a little sinister at first and then become thorny with sharp crystal dots. A song that contains references to another song inside ( "The ballad of Lucy Jordan" ).
<p />
"Hungarian love song" is not a ballad although it seems from the title, it takes up the optimism of the principle very much in the line of the group. They have just had their identity clear and they will exploit it as soon as they realize it.
<p />

"The new world" makes them intimate. Percussions recall other musical styles, could be performed by any more classical singer. Provides variety to the disc assembly.
<p />
"Who loves you now" delves into that more classic style. They don't look like a group from the eighties, much less pop to use. Vocal harmonies predominate, the "dudua" that he liked so much in previous decades and the keyboards. One of the best on the album to open a monumental "B" face.
<p />

In "Domestic Animal" they are already released, after several hesitation and tests of various types have taken a run. The album is yours and they will demonstrate it especially in the guitars and the choirs at the end.
<p />

"Buffalo Shame" I can't find it. Bad luck! It seems that it will be instrumental for its long introduction that reminds us of the soundtrack of some "western". The flute appears for the first time, replaced shortly by absolutely sixties guitars. They chant more than they sing, the voice is one more instrument.
<p />
The initial strumming of the guitar announces something exceptional and although it is titled "Nothing Special" it is really special. Youthful, easy, contagious, ironic pop, somewhat presumptuous and cynical ( as befits the early ages ). Spy looks, sitting on a train, with which I totally identify, laughing inside everything and everyone. Now that we are older we already know that we will limit ourselves to repeating, if not the same, similar mistakes.
<p />
"The name of this train is the Nothing Special<br/>
It's just an ordinary train<br/>
A very ordinary train<br/>
Just like all the others; just a very ordinary train"
<p />

No pause compared to the previous one. They have left it for last because they know it is the best, it is the song that will make them last forever. A clearly nocturnal melody in contrast to the daylight that clearly gives off the previous one. The theme grows progressively with those angels dressed in black who are always inside and whom you would like to hug. Increase the number of instruments, the saxophone appears to differentiate it, to make it always mine, always yours ( if you want ). A song that has given me many laps from the first day and that will not let me go. One of those little pieces of soul housed anonymously on the net for anyone who wants to find it. According to Fish: "Written on the morning that news broke about Reagan's bombing of Tripoli."
<p />
"I can see them.<br/>
Here they come now.<br/>
There's thousands of them.<br/>
They're bearing you up.<br/>
They're holding you up.<br/>
I want to hold you in my arms." <br/>

Within half a year Fire Records releases two box sets with albums by a band that I had never heard of before. It seems the label specialises in doing these sort of thing. E.g. Pere Ubu and The Bevis Frond can be found on these pages. Now The Jazz Butcher follows in their slipstream. Last October Fire Records released 'The Wasted Years' and in March 'The Violent Years' will follow.
<p />
I picked out one album to see what I think of the The Jazz Butcher, like I have done with several of the other box sets in the past. Why A Scandal In Bohemia? Simply because it is the first album in the first set? Well not only. The title holds something intriguing as well. It is 1985 in Oxford. Bohemia is still behind the Iron Curtain and not a place to just drive to without real borders and passport controls. So why call an album A Scandal In Bohemia?
<p />
What I notice digging into the album is that it goes from dark wave that I hated so much at the time to whatever comes into the mind of Pat Fish and his compadres at the time. Nothing seems too far out it seems. Every idea is explored and worked out in the rehearsal room and brought to the studio. Fish sings some of the songs with that typical voice of the time. All influenced by the master of death Ian Curtis. Luckily it seems he had already discovered another tone as well, often aided by others in the band.
<p />
Within 40 minutes The Jazz Butcher leads me into so many different small corners of the pop and rock music that I both like and dislike that it nearly leaves me dazed and confused. No there is no classic rock here. What I have found, is (Irish) folk, new wave, The Velvet Underground, (early 60s) pop, punk, country/surf and all brought like the band does nothing else; per song. In short, the band specialises in all these different influences and sounds in a way I would not have been surprised to have heard a top cover of 'Dancing Queen' on the album. So confusing it will probably have been too much to ask from most listeners who liked to be locked into their little bubble in the 80s. You were in or out at the time. There was little in between.
<p />
And here's The Jazz Butcher stepping over all these boundaries and here I am in early 2018. The guy who abhorred most of what went on musically in the decade called the 80s and having a great time, most of the time, with A Scandal In Bohemia.
<p />
The start is upbeat, the Cure style with 'Southern Mark Smith (Big Return)'. I suppose the Smith from that 80s exponent The Fall*? The acoustic guitars give the song a pop feel. The lead lines on the electric guitar go back to the early The Cure songs infused with a little Big Country spunk. The Jazz Butcher is just as direct. The richness of the ideas and additions of sounds and the organ give away that this is not just a new wave punky band releasing its first song of the first album. This band has thought had about what it wants. The little bell sounds that opens the second song, 'Real Men', only attest to this idea. The song is as dark as the early Simple Minds songs and Comsat Angels, etc. And there are these little bells the whole time and the soft sounding chorus harmonies singing "real men from hell" as if they are seeing angels instead. The combination works real well.
<p />
With this I have found the key to this album. The Jazz Butcher loves to combine influences from different spectra and work them into a new song. Together Pat Fish, Mark Eider, Owen Jones and David J. brew these influences into a unique The Jazz Butcher song. They even do a Stray Cats pastiche, 'I Need Meat', but not without adding something the U.S. band would never have thought of in its wildest. Let alone the title.
<p />
A Scandal In Bohemia is an adventure in music where everything is allowed. I read somewhere someone declaring it one of the best albums ever made. I would not want to venture that far, but it certainly has a fair chance entering my list of favourite albums of the 80s. This is an album that lovers of music from the 60s and 70s and 80s should give a chance. There is so much to discover, so many hints of pleasant influences and far beyond the few I have mentioned here, that A Scandal In Bohemia is also a pub music quiz, next to a musical delight.
<p />
Except for that question at the beginning I haven't got answered, nothing much remains to be desired.
<p />
Wo.

On retrouve sur l’ultime album du regretté Pat Fish tout ce qu’on a aimé sur ses disques précédents : le mélange d’excentricité, de lucidité et de vulnérabilité, les mélodies tranquillement parfaites et cette impression d’entendre chanter – pour la dernière fois – un vieil ami.
<p />
Bien sûr, on aurait préféré ne pas avoir à écrire que “The Highest in the Land” sera le dernier album du Jazz Butcher, Pat Fish nous ayant quittés en octobre dernier. Au moins peut-on préciser que ce disque est bien, a priori, celui que son auteur voulait sortir, ce qui n’est pas toujours le cas avec les œuvres posthumes. A l’évidence, ce recueil de neuf chansons – dont certaines écrites il y a plusieurs années et souvent jouées sur scène – était bouclé avant que l’Anglais ne passe l’arme à gauche. Le dandy de Northampton l’a sans doute enregistré en sachant que le fil fragile de sa vie pouvait rompre à tout moment. Pourtant, “The Highest in the Land” n’a rien d’une rumination morbide, pas plus qu’il ne se veut un monument à laisser à la postérité. C’est juste un ultime très bon disque du Jazz Butcher, à peu près dans la lignée des précédents.
<p />

Certes, sur “Time”, le premier extrait dévoilé, notre cher disparu évoque sans détour le (peu de) temps qu’il reste. Mais si “Fishy” reconnaît dans ce memento mori qu’il n’en a plus pour longtemps (“Time’s running out. The money’s running out. You don’t need me to tell you what it’s all about”), il ne faut pas compter sur lui pour se lamenter sur son sort. Scandé sur une sorte d’instrumental blues-dub monté en boucle, le texte passe d’un fatalisme amusé à des énumérations absurdes (“Luminous. Leguminous. Salubrious. Lugubrious”, “Respectable. Bespectacled. Electable. Detestable”) et à la description implacable d’un monde qui ne tourne pas rond (“A small boy who just watched his cousin being shot / Is being pushed down a mine coz we’ve got to have the lithium. Forced labour, privatised jails. Yeah – and all that that entails”). Du pur Pat.
<p />

Ce mélange, lettré mais sans prétention, de fantaisie et de gravité qui a fait de l’auteur l’égal pas assez reconnu des plus fines plumes d’outre-Manche accompagne sur le reste de l’album une écriture plus mélodique, d’une belle variété. “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar” suit le sillon Hot Club de France de l’album précédent et c’est d’une délicieuse désuétude, tandis que “Running on Fumes” semble convoquer Jonathan Richman (“Abominable Snowman in the Market”) et surtout Bob Dylan (“Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts”), avec une grosse pincée de country, pour délivrer un état des lieux rageur du Royaume-Uni brexité. Enluminée de ce qui pourrait être une trompette à sourdine, “Sea Madness” – hommage à un certain Turkish George, personnalité légendaire de la scène musicale de Northampton – a la clarté d’un ciel d’été et la légèreté d’un nuage : une chanson proche de la perfection et pourtant déroulée sans effort, tout à fait représentative de l’art faussement nonchalant de Pat Fish.
<p />

Mais c’est sans doute sur les pures ballades que le Jazz Butcher brille le plus : la clôture “Goodnight Sweetheart”, extinction des feux d’une classe absolue, et surtout “Never Give Up” qui nous avait déjà fait forte impression sur scène (notamment lors d’un concert à Malakoff en septembre 2019, escapade francilienne dont témoigne la photo de pochette prise devant la gare du Nord par Philippe Dufour). On la classe d’emblée parmi ses chansons les plus bouleversantes, en gardant le titre comme épitaphe et conseil de vie. Merci pour tout, mister Fish.

<div class="iview_q">
We had a conversation when I was in Northampton a few years ago about your annoyance at the press for labeling The Jazz Butcher as a "twee" band. You stated that you considered The Jazz Butcher to be a punk band. Can you give me your definition of punk rock and The JBC's place within that musical/cultural sphere?
</div>
<div class="iview_a">
A story from long ago: I was on the tour bus talking to the journalist Robin Gibson from Sounds, a lovely chap whom I still see from time to time today. It was the spring of 1985 and our band had just played Berlin for the first time. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself, as evidenced by my remark to Robin along the lines of "We are the last punk rock band!" Robin, a razor-sharp Scotsman, fixed me with a Look and said: "You're as punk as the Pogues." "Well," I replied, "They're punk." "Exactly my point," said Robin. Snookered!
<p />
I detest most "genre" terms in music but I particularly despise the idea that "indie" is a word that describes a kind of music. To people of my generation it was a way of doing business, nothing more, which — as it happens — was part of the aftershock from punk. Suddenly small bands on small labels were competing with the well-financed pets of the established companies and it was very exciting, but if you look at the "indie charts" of the time you will see that the bands in it played all manner of wildly different styles.
<p />
For goodness's sake, all the much-derided Stock Aitken and Waterman "hit factory" records by Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley and the like all appeared on the indie chart because the canny producers had their own independent label.
<p />
People talk about the C-86 sound. Are they having a laugh? Does it sound like Velocity Girl era Primal Scream or does it sound like Bogshed? Fatuous!
<p />
So terms like "indie" make my flesh creep, and, of course, somewhere deep in the "indie scene" there is this thing called "twee." I have probably never heard 90% of the so-called twee bands, but I did have a brief association with a German label called Marsh-Marigold which might, I suppose, have qualified as operating within that area. That said, their band with whom I was working at the time (the Purelove) sounded more like the Pet Shop Boys than anything else on the label.
<p />
So I have no real idea of what the "twee" scene might be about but I do know one thing: nobody who ever played in any serious line-up of our band could possibly have been described as a "twee" individual. More than one or two of them would probably have knocked you out for suggesting it.
<p />
What punk did for me was to re-engage with the original primal excitement and urgency of the mid-sixties scene with things like the Who's "Can't Explain" or the almost-hits of The Creation. When I saw the Pistols in July 1976 the set list included songs by the Kinks, the Small Faces, even "Stepping Stone" as made famous by the Monkees. There was nothing "new" about the music. What was new to me and my generation at the time was the raw, home-cooked approach and the complete absence of any "star" behaviour among the people on the stage. The sight of regular kids your own age doing this on a stage was empowering. (Not that I'm calling Rotten "regular", you understand. I'm not mental.)
<p />
Of course, very quickly the imitators started to appear and within a couple of years punk as a musical style had become a total straightjacket. Then at the start of 1980 the Clash just blew everything apart with the fabulous, sprawling manifesto that is London Calling. With Topper on the drums they suddenly had the capacity to embrace a myriad of different styles and genres, all the time keeping their own sonic imprint and their own unique attitude. That was the record that showed me that the real message of punk for musicians is that you should be free to express yourself exactly as you want, not just in terms of lyrics but in terms of music as well.
<p />
There were other lessons to be learned, too, about the way one conducted one-self in business and the enormous importance of remembering to use the word "no" from time to time. As Chuck D (surely one of the great punks!) said on his solo album: "Only got two letters, only takes a second to say it." So, yes, especially at the start we identified as punk rockers. We didn't dress like it and we didn't necessarily always sound like it, but —importantly — we felt like it.

I once told you that if you changed one letter in your song "Niagra" and made it "Viagra" you could make a million dollars from the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. If remember correctly you responded "Yes, but then would have no soul". Considering the changes in the music industry and how difficult it is to make a living as a working musician, do you still consider the licensing of one's art as soul destroying?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
It really depends on to whom one is licensing it. I've no problem with somebody using my work to advertise a good product like Pilsner Urquell or a good cause. Arms dealers and banks probably need not waste their time writing in.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Fire Records has recently rereleased eight classic Jazz Butcher albums between two box sets: The Violent Years, and The Wasted Years. All of them remastered and in beautiful packaging with extensive liner notes. How satisfied were you with the results?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
I thought that the people at Fire Records did a really good job. The box sets were very flattering and they garnered some very kind reviews around the world, as well. I believe that a third set, featuring all the singles, b-sides and oddities, is currently in production.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Whoever did the remastering did a fantastic job. I discover new things in the music that I have never heard in past — guitar parts, samples, etc. Have you heard anything in the remasters that you had forgotten you put there? Who is the engineer that did the re-mastering?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
The remastering was done by a chap called Brian Pyle, who, as I understand it, does a lot of this sort of thing for Fire Records. I was quite taken with his version of Last of the Gentleman Adventurers. I thought he did well to take out some of the lower mid-range, where, in retrospect, perhaps the bottom end of our triple Roland Space Echo abuse did tend to hang around and clog things up a little. The acoustic guitars are pin-bright on his version, which I like. I do wonder, though, if it has made the record sound a bit more "indie" in the current parlance. Was he trying to make it "relevant" to the ears of 2 I st Century hipsters? I have no idea. Nobody ever tells me anything. 
<p />
I can't say that I really noticed his influence too much on the re-issues. You do, however, have to bear in mind that in the case of Fishcotheque and Cult of the Basement, I hadn't heard the records for a full decade.
<p />
As for discovering new things in the mix, well, you have to remember that I was there when all this shit went down. I can still remember things that were on the tape that never made it onto the records. So I'm not really the man to ask about that.
<p />
Basically, I'm glad you like what Brian has done. I certainly have no particular problem with any of it.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
You describe your album In Bath of Bacon as "The one nobody ever talks about" and that it "seems very 80's now". Whilst I'm pretty sure you are referring more to the performances than the recording, I must say that listening to the remastered version has elevated it. I hope this doesn't sound insulting but I never knew that In Bath of Bacon could sound this good! Has the remastering of In Bath of Bacon changed the way you feel about it? Were you are surprised as I was to hear it sound this good?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
I played the test pressing of the remastered vinyl LP once. It was traumatic. At one point I went to the bathroom, next door to where the record was playing. "Sex Engine" was on the stereo at the time. All that I could hear through the wall was this idiot bellowing as though in the grip of a schizophrenic episode. Harrowing.
<p />
I don't believe that I have even played the remastered CD version. 
</div>


<div class="iview_q">
We have seen The Jazz Butcher, The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, The Jazz Butcher and His Sikkorskis From Hell (did I miss any?). Lately you have been operating as The jazz Butcher Quartet. Will this be an ongoing concern? Will there be an album recorded with this new lineup?
</div>


<div class="iview_a">
Well, you couldn't be expected to remember 
them all. There was the Jazz Butcher and his Big Soppy Pussycats, for a start. I flirted with calling the band the Supermeats (after a cat food on the market at the time) but the vegans in the band weren't having that.
<p />
At the start of 2018 the Quartet actually morphed into the Quintet for a few gigs when we added keyboard player Nick Bandy to the line-up. Sadly, after three or four storming shows, it seems that this particular band has just sort of evaporated. At the moment, I don't have any plans to build a new live band. I shall still play the very occasional gig on my own (I think I've finally become quite good at that) but band gigs worth doing are almost impossible to come by, so there's really no point in messing musicians about by telling them that they're in a band when the band doesn't — in any real sense — exist. 
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
What does the future hold for my beloved JBC?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
Well, as I say, I don't know if there really will be a band as such. Nonetheless, I'm lucky enough to know lots of good musicians, so if a recording project were to come up, I'm sure we could assemble some manner of combo to undertake it. 
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
Finally, will the world ever be treated to another collaboration between you and the amazing Mr. Maximilian Eider?
</div>

<div class="iview_a">
To be honest, I have no idea. Any live collaboration is likely to be out of the question, as Max has simply had enough of that particular way of working. A studio collaboration is much more likely, but first we would need to be in a position where someone was putting us into a studio to record.
<p />
Of course, there was a time in the late eighties when it appeared that Max and I wouldn't even speak to each other again, but, as we know, we've done tons of stuff together both onstage and in the recording studio since then. Never say never: that's what I have learned.
</div>

<div class="iview_q">
We here at Big Stir have started creating our own slang language (slanguage?). The one word that seems to have gained the most traction is "Croz", as in David Crosby of The Byrds/CSN&Y. When something is very cool it s "Croz" or "Totally Croz" or "Croz as fuck". Could you tell us something that you would consider to be Croz as fuck? Could we get you to create a new word off the top of your head for the Big Stir Slanguage dictionary?

You're probably aware that during a European tour in 1988 the band developed an absurdly complex private language called "surrealist rhyming slang." Our equivalent of "Croz as fuck" would have been "Waiters and that!"
<p />
If you would like a concrete example of what we considered to be "Waiters and that!", well, it might be a particularly splendid dinner (probably how the term developed in the first place), a great gig or just a moment of genius...like...for example...Crosby's ridiculous solo at the top end of Eight Miles High.
<p />
And a brand new word/phrase for your own patois? Let me see...how about... <i>"A glass for Doctor Chumley?"</i> - for - <i>"Let's go out in the car park and get high."</i> </div>

Creation Records is rightly recognized as one of the prime movers of British independent music. In 1988, though, the label was just starting to hit its stride. That year, it released the debut albums from the House of Love and My Bloody Valentine, two progenitors of the soon-to-be-trendy UK shoegaze scene. It also issued
Barbed Wire Kisses, a compilation from noise pop groundbreakers the Jesus and Mary Chain, as well as albums of fey indie pop from Felt and the Pastels. This handful of albums pretty much established the aesthetic that would make Creation famous, at least until Oasis came along.
<p />
There was an outlier, however. Creation has just signed Pat Fish, the creator and sole remaining member of the British indie group the Jazz Butcher. The Butcher had already released four albums of alternately manic and gorgeous indie music.
Fishcoteque, their fifth, was their first for Creation. It, too, came out in 1988. It incorporated many of the sounds that could be heard on those other ’88 Creation records. Strangely, though, it had little in common with them. It was outward-looking as much as inward; it was not afraid of humor, wit, or self-deprecation; and it was art masquerading as pop rather than the other way around.
<p />
Fishcoteque is one of four Jazz Butcher albums collected on The Violent Years, which also includes Big Planet Scarey Planet, Cult of the Basement, and Condition Blue. The albums were released once-per-year between 1988 and 1991, all on Creation. The Violent Years is the sequel to The Wasted Years (2017), which compiled the Butcher’s first four albums. The Violent Years also represents the heart of what the Jazz Butcher was all about, throwing off most of the throwaway silliness that marred parts of Fish’s early work and getting right down to focusing on what he did best, which is make something out of everything. All of it is worthwhile, and much of it is very, very good. In fact, there isn’t a better run of four albums in the entire history of British indie music.
<p />
The Violent Years is an apt title. Fish devours pop culture, pop music, and the human condition with a ferocity and zest that is relentless and sometimes ruthless. The allusions and references come fast. Lionel Richie, Thomas Pynchon, “Dueling Banjos”, science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, Ray Davies, and Madonna’s “You can dance” invocation from “Into the Groove” — all these and more make appearances, cycled through Fish’s psyche and made to work in service of his wit and songwriting skill. The name-dropping isn’t novel, though, in part because much of it is couched in meaningful social commentary, and the rest is couched in lyrics that are worth reading.
<p />
Also, there is a funk/rap song about chicken. There is a country-western number about flying around in a Zeppelin, “Over Mexico, where tequila’s not expensive, and the weapons are extensive.” There is a Bo Diddley stomper about an ongoing infatuation with Shirley MacLaine (“This is the last thing that I thought could ever happen”). Original guitarist Max Eider had left, but a stable of talented players is more than capable, even approaching metal-like intensity on apocalyptic grinders “Line of Death” and, erm, “Do the Bubonic Plague”. Furthermore, Fish employs sampled sounds and bits of dialogue for additional color and, often, disorientation.
<p />
This barely-controlled chaos isn’t even half the story with
The Violent Years, though. Within the compilation are at least a half-dozen tracks that could’ve/should’ve been enduring indie pop classics. Why, Cult of the Basement alone boasts the unbeatable one-two punch of the whirlwind powerpop “She’s on Drugs” and the shimmering, heartsick “Pineapple Tuesday”. Not only do such songs temper the Butcher’s inherent near-madness. They also feature some of the most delectable guitar jangling this side of the Smiths. Furthermore, there is what would be Fish’s “secret weapon” if it weren’t in plain earshot. The man can write a devastating, devastatingly beautiful ballad. With judicious programming, The Violent Years is an awesome dream pop album. From the gorgeous “The Good Ones” to the equally gorgeous “Sister Death”, from the plaintive “Racheland” to the wistful “Susie”, these are dead-serious, sincere meditations on tragic, bygone relationships, which seem to be the only kind Fish has ever had.
<p />
Even with Fish as the only constant, the playing on
The Violent Years is of a piece and consistently top-notch, with appearances from then-and-future members of Spacemen 3, the Blue Aeroplanes, Suede, and others. The production has dated fairly well but can not completely escape the tinny confines of the era. Perhaps in an attempt to remedy this, the remastering overplays its hand with reverb and volume, so the hi-hats tend to sound like churning water. Too bad, but not fatal. In true Creation fashion, these albums have long been out of print, so it is great to have them collected and bound and with liner notes from Pat Fish himself, no less.
<p />
Certainly, there was nowhere else in the post-synthpop, pre-Britpop morass where you could hear the Velvet Underground, the Clash, Television, Talking Heads and Nick Lowe all coming together in the space of nine or ten songs. In terms of combining melodic gift with intellectual heft, only the Go-Betweens might have been considered Fish’s peers. But even they had two songwriters. There has never been, nor will there ever be, one like the Butcher.
The Violent Years is essential. And would you believe the best was yet to come?

One night about a month ago, Pat Fish (born Patrick Huntrods on 20 December, 1957), and also known as the Jazz Butcher, was posting a video apologizing for cancelling an upcoming Fishy Mansions show from his living room, saying every time he fell asleep the night before, it had felt like he was about to choke to death. He made a point of describing the horrible feeling that was, if you can imagine it, right when you started to drift off, thinking ah yes, good, it’s over, then arrh, right there you start to choke—it’s like nothing else. But sorry, my friends, I’m very sorry, and no, it’s not the Covid, we’ll be back, thanks for all your good wishes, and the next thing I knew, someone was announcing the Butcher had died in his sleep the night before.
<p />
<div class="annotation">
“Livin forever don’t look so clever to me.” –Pat Fish
</div>
<p />
Despite or more likely because of his lack of processing as popular currency, Pat seemed to me to have made the most of his experience in this world with a life full of friendship and humor and coolness and good feelings. Hs surprise death with its unconscious introduction inspired me to love everyone again, model myself on the template he’d set.
<p />
A member of that Invisible College of highly talented musicians to emerge from the UK punk scene never fully falling prey to any excesses of stateside acclaim, at least partly by choice, Pat made everyone feel like a star. I made his acquaintance on Facebook a few years ago as one whose teen years had been colored and influenced by his sound and style, especially the albums ‘Bloody Nonsense’, ‘Fishcotheque’, ‘Distressed Gentlefolk’, and the recently released ‘Last of the Gentleman Adventurers’. His naturally inclusive manner felt complimentary, and never felt condescending, and I interviewed Pat last year several months into Covid lockdown in the U.S.
<p />
When asked about performing online, he made a disparaging remark about untalented geezers popping up everywhere with “PayPalMe!” signs at the slightest opportunity, something he considered beneath himself. His resistance softened by the continuing unavailability of public venues to play in, he began to produce sporadic episodes of Live From Fishy Mansions, playing old favorites and new stuff and improvised riffs for his cult of faithful followers and important friendships (among them David J Haskins of Bauhaus, Tones on Tail, and Love and Rockets, graphic art genius Alan Moore, creator of the Watchmen, and the late Mark E. Smith of the Fall, who wrote a song about him.)
<p />
Pat read Lit. Hum. At Merton College, Oxford, graduating in 1980. He lived most of his life in Northampton, UK, working at a used bookstore for a time, developing into one of the last couple of century’s more literate songwriters and cultural critics. He is survived by “Raoul” (his cat), and was a great lover of neurotransmitting in the human computer, if you know what I mean by that, as seen here, and here, and in this brand new song called ‘Time’ released one week after his death, which might make you cry.
<p />
Musically speaking, the sounds produced by the Pat as the Jazz Butcher, with the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, Sikorskis From Hell, or any of the other acts he helmed, also featuring talents like Maximillian Eider, ranges from punk to new wave to sounds indescribably brilliantine and unbeatable and cooler-than-most, as here, or here, or here. Some tracks are more to my liking than others, and I can’t think of a single bad album he ever released.
<p />
The brand new 4 CD collection, ‘Dr. Cholmondeley Repents: A-sides, B-Sides and Seasides’, will be released on December 10th, 2021. Treat yourselves. Thanks, Pat.
<p />
From Wikipedia: According to a post on Fish’s official Facebook page on 6 October 2021, he “died suddenly but peacefully yesterday evening.” On 3 October, Fish was scheduled to perform a web concert, however at show time, Fish appeared live to inform his audience he was not feeling well and would be re-scheduling the performance for the following week. By means of explanation for his ill health, he offered that he had been suffering from sleep apnea. It was later reported that Fish had died of a heart attack.

Arguably one of the finest concept albums ever made, Frank Sinatra’s September Of My Years is a poignant and heartbreaking meditation on getting older.
<p />
It’s Sinatra’s own Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man, as the occasion for this record—Sinatra’s imminent fiftieth birthday—was soon to turn the artist himself into a man that was no longer young. The album is a melancholic and windswept look back at the everclear forever days of careless youth, where one lives unconcerned about time, space and eternity. Filled with equal parts triumph and regret, September Of My Years is bittersweet and woebegone, sure, but it also finds Sinatra pretty uneasy about the notion of growing old.
<p />
Putting it simply, he wasn’t into it at all.
<p />
Leonard Cohen was four years older than the September-era Sinatra when he wrote “Tower Of Song” and he was far more candid than the Chairman when it came to the changes that were happening both inside and outside of his body:
<p />
<div class="annotation">
Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I’m crazy for love but I’m not coming on
I’m just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song
</div>
<p />
In his composition, Cohen was keenly aware that things were not as they used to be and he was settling into middle age with both resignation and acceptance. The ladies’ man still had familiar carnal urges, but little energy for all it entailed. It was a way of life whose death he predicted eleven years earlier on an album coincidentally titled Death Of A Ladies’ Man.
<p />
The Jazz Butcher’s new single “Time” has all the weariness and self-awareness of a Septembering Sinatra and a towering Cohen.
<p />
Lapping Cohen’s notion that old age was imminent, The Jazz Butcher (the beloved Pat Fish) at sixty-three seemed to feel that what was coming was far more serious than just the uncomfortable press of time. Long past mourning the ubiquity of sensual pleasure, he was aware of something much more acute: human frailty. The ills of the body—its weaknesses and its porous boundaries seemed to be hanging heavy over the Butcher, having beaten cancer a few years earlier.
<p />
Unfairly, “Time” has ended up being a posthumous single. That the lovely and charming Fish died before his band’s new album The Highest In The Land is slated to hit shelves in February, strikes deep as one of the crueler plot-twists the universe has delivered lately. Fish intended the record to be his valedictory bow but it seems barbarous to actually not have him here to take that bow in real life.
<p />
But here we are and we’re lucky as hell to get one more album from the King of Northampton and heartbreaking as it is to not be able to raise a glass in front of the man himself, a metaphorical glass in this case will have to do.
<p />
“Time” is a lyrical suckerpunch given Fish’s recent demise and even a casual attempt at reverse engineering will reveal the lyrics to be decidedly prophetic.
<p />
In our last conversation Fish seemed comfortably settled about not being the indie rock gunslinger of yesteryear and instead he came across like a distinguished elder statesman—professorial in the most post-punk of ways: erudite, hilarious, reflective, philosophical and a little bit sad. The sadness was hard to pinpoint, but it hovered over our chat like an uninvited guest he’d grown accustomed to sharing space with.
<p />
While Cohen tells us in “Tower of Song” that he hears Hank Williams “…coughing all night long/100 floors above me/In the Tower of Song,” Fish seems to suggest that’s 99 floors higher than how he hears it. Over a syncopated beat he sings:
<p />
<div class="annotation">
My hair’s all wrong. My time ain’t long.<br />
Fishy go to heaven, get along, get along.
</div>
<p />
Fish’s description of himself will likely send you to a dictionary (“Luminous. Leguminous. Salubrious. Lugubrious.”), but definitions aside, this was a self-portrait fashioned with a sword. It’s a man taking stock and poking fun and wondering what in the devil the appeal could ever have been about living a quiet life.
<p />
The thing about being young is that time seems limitless and endless. But as you get older, you feel the exact opposite. And all that limitlessness and endlessness you realize was a youthful illusion and you’ve been sand in a tipped over hourglass all along.
<p />
Unapologetically, Fish seems to realize his excesses might very well have hastened the sand’s journey:
<p />
<div class="annotation">
I’ve overdone the underside and now I am undone.
There’s no one here to see, though, cos I don’t see anyone.<br />
And if I hadn’t told you that, you never would have known,<br />
Unless I told you secretly when we were all alone.<br />
Things are running slow. Things are running low.<br />
You can have one more but then we gotta go.<br />
One more before the bottle. One more before the mast.<br />
One more shot for Davy Jones, better make it fast.
</div>
<p />
When I first read the lyrics to “Time” I guessed the song was a ballad, but it’s not. It’s a mid-tempo number with a trip-hop backbeat, an upbeat chorus and Max Eider’s guitar winding through it all with delicacy and finesse.
<p />
Were it a ballad it would be positively wrenching, but Fish’s half rap delivery gives “Time” an unexpected buoyancy. It’s a gleeful look at a life lived exactly the way one wanted it to be lived. And so the repercussions of that life, though unpleasant and unpredictable, were, putting it in transactional terms, well worth it.
<p />
And probably not that unpredictable at all.
<p />
“Time” skips away like an undulating epitaph, but were Fish alive, I wonder how it would land. It might read more like a man tempting fate rather than a man in its grasp.
<p />
Hard to say.
<p />
What’s easy to say, however, is that “Time” is a killer track; a sly and slithering number that’s got fancier footwork than perhaps fate knows how to deal with. Fish gets that he’s burned himself down to the wick, but he also gets that if he hadn’t, there wouldn’t have been any point in having a wick in the first place.
<p />
Charming as ever, funny as hell and deeply sentimental, in that last chat we had, I caught The Butcher on a Saturday evening in Northampton and we talked well into the night. His puckish good looks were still there, but instead of being a Casanova of Cocktail, his floppy gray hair and warm smile brought to mind something more emeritus than his past iteration. With a drink in his hand and a lit cigarette in the other, he took a long drag, narrowed his eyes into a gunfighter’s scowl and there in a flash was a quick glimpse of mischief and danger.
<p />
And then it was gone.
<p />
Fish is gone now, too, but in death he seems to have achieved something comfortingly celestial. His melodies soar as mightily as ever and the wit and the wisdom of his lyrics serve as a cosmic roadmap which forges a wild and golden path that runs from London to Hamburg to Japan to California and ends on the rainy doorstep of a metaphorical mansion in Northampton.
<p />
And those lyrics tell the story of a man who lived one hell of a life. And that life was raucous, feral, wild, untethered and uncompromising and it was filled with ghosts and angels and penguins and elephants and trains and girls who kept goldfish and falling in love and getting lost in France and burning through the bluest of conditions.
<p />
We should all be so lucky.

We lost Pat Fish, aka The Jazz Butcher, last year, but he left us with a new album, The Highest in the Land, which is out this week via Tapete. The first Jazz Butcher album in 10 years, it features longtime collaborator Max Eider, guitarist Peter Crouch (who played on Condition Blue and Waiting for the Love Bus), Weather Prophets drummer Dave Morgan (who played on The Jazz Butcher’s 1988 album Fishcotheque), and bassist Tim Harries.
<p />
There’s a sense of finality to the album — “He’d been around the block and knew he was on the last lap” says Lee Russell — which comes through in songs. “Lemmy and Bowie and Prince all gone,” Pat sings on the jaunty “Running on Fumes” which is actually as much about the state of post-Brexit Britain as it is mortality. “I didn’t see it coming and I didn’t see you care / Is there anything as cheap as chasing profit from despair?”
<p />
The video for “Running on Fumes” is decidedly more lighthearted. Made by Ruth Tidmarsh, with help from Bid of The Monochrome Set and Dhiren Basu, it features the adventures of a few stop-motion animated toy animals, including stuffed elephant and a number of fish, who are trying to escape their aquarium and make it to a Jazz Butcher show. “I shot the animation for the video at a low frame rate and put some digital motion blur on afterwards, to give it a dreamy, retro-kids tv look,” Ruth tells us. “In reality, this was, partly, due to time constraints and the challenges of trying to direct a drunk elephant and some delinquent stunt-fish. As with life, there were no real storyboards involved — they all just did what they could to navigate the chaos and get to the gig. I think Pat would have liked that.”
<p />
${embedVideo(url=https://youtube.com/embed/0Wk4tzKjvJ4)}
<p />
Both fish and elephants are winks to the Jazz Butcher universe, and the video is loaded with easter eggs for fans. It’s charming, witty and a little melancholic, which describes The Jazz Butcher himself. The video premieres in this post and you can watch below.
