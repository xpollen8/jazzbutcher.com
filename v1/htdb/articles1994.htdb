	<p>
	For anyone in the rainy PNW let me tell you where I found The Luv Bus (and<br>
	quite soon after the UK release):  The Ozone in PDX.  There was only one<br>
	copy when I bought it and I'm sorry to say it wasn't there over the<br>
	holidays.  If you're dying for it, call the Ozone (or better yet drop by -<br>
	it's just across the street from Powell's the megalopolis bookstore).  As<br>
	I recall it was $19.<br>
	<br>
	Also, if you're planning to travel through the cascade mountain range you<br>
	might want to stay at the Big Foot Motel on Hwy 26 near Sandy, OR.  It's<br>
	the place where Big Foot reached for his credit card.  Last time The<br>
	Butcher was in Portland he played Big Foot Motel and was well received.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You can check in but you don't check out&quot;<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Waiting for the Bus
	<p>
	There's no Love in Lovebus.<br>
	<br>
	there's also nothing about the JBC in this posting so if you're busy I<br>
	would recommend not reading this.<br>
	<br>
	Still with me? Regular readers of this column may recall the last JBC event<br>
	I was scheduled to appear at was a close call because someone had the<br>
	audacity to throw themselves in front of a picadilly line train, thus very<br>
	nearly preventing me from arriving at Angel Station in time. Well... as the<br>
	giant would say... it is happening again.<br>
	<br>
	Night before gig: my word, am I drinking a lot. (Yes) Still, it's worth it<br>
	because there's not long to go before Xmas and I'm leaving the drizzle of<br>
	Edinburgh and My Destiny behind for the sunshine of the East Midlands.<br>
	<br>
	Morning of gig: feel *terrible*. Can I get up? Let's try.... whooops. I<br>
	pack a few items and depart. Stop for pint of beer at the airport whilst<br>
	waiting for the plane.  Mistake. But I'm OK. Hold back from the Gin and<br>
	Tonic inflight.  Arrive in London, train from airport unhindered by dead<br>
	bodies. Arrive at coach station: 5:30 bus gets me into Northampton Central<br>
	District at about 7:30.  Loadsa time to find wherever it's on exactly (&quot;The<br>
	Belgium&quot;?)<br>
	<br>
	Bus is late. Bus is then very late. Bus is then *extremely* late. Why? Dead<br>
	bodies on the motorway. Seems all major roads from London to Eastern<br>
	England are closed due to a *huge* pileup and massive motorway death. Bus<br>
	now scheduled to depart at about 8:00, arriving 10:00. Can I wait? Yes I<br>
	bloody well can. Might well miss the damn thing but I've got a bus ticket<br>
	now so I might as well try. Think I'll just ring the venue to check.<br>
	<br>
	At this point, Directory Enquiries have no clue as to the location of The<br>
	Belgium (which, in retrospect, doesn't surprise me) so I perform a current<br>
	situation evaluation exercise:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}    For Going: I want to go. I said I'd go.<br>
	Against Going: I won't get there in time. I don't know where it is. I feel<br>
	${icon_blank}		terrible. I don't want to spend the night sleeping at<br>
	${icon_blank}		Northampton Bus Station.<br>
	<br>
	So I cut my losses, spend the money I had earmarked for beer on a clutch of<br>
	CDs (including the disappointing Friendloverplane 2) in &quot;Cheapo Cheapo<br>
	Records&quot; and then spend the money I had earmarked for beer *again* but on<br>
	beer in some dingy pub on Brewer Street. Oatmeal Stout and Lagavulin<br>
	chasers.<br>
	<br>
	Make my way disconsolately back to the ancestral home and collapse.<br>
	<br>
	Sorry.<br>

	Hi, my name's David and I just joined the list.  Happy to be here.  I<br>
	guess this is not a support group per se, but I'll say this anyway, since<br>
	I'm sure you can all understand.  I made the mistake of loaning my<br>
	&quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot; tape to a friend recently and he trashed it.<br>
	I may never get to hear &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot; again.<br>
	<br>
	Having said that, has anyone heard of any plans to release older JBC stuff?<br>
	Or has any recently been released?  The record shops around here (Chapel<br>
	Hill, NC) are useless.  Thanks.<br>

	We also have vinyl copies of &quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot; and &quot;Distressed <br>
	Gentlefolk&quot;, but are planning to sell those locally because adding<br>

	i find it interesting that condition blue makes<br>
	tiny references to `birds' in only the first and last<br>

	<p>
	&gt; Are there any songs other than She's On Drugs that contain<br>
	&gt; little snippets referring to earlier songs?<br>
	<br>
	Well, there's &quot;She's a Yo-yo&quot; which has a line something like `she<br>
	was on drugs now she's on the blink' (my memory is playing tricks<br>
	with me at the moment so I can't swear to that one). Don't know if<br>
	just referring to a previous song counts. If it does then<br>
	&quot;Excellent!&quot; must surely take the prize for referring to about half<br>
	of Cult of the Basement somewhere in the lyrics. Well, that's an<br>
	exaggeration but it is sorta self-referential.<br>
	<br>
	It's not a butch song but you've probably heard it anyway so I<br>
	suppose it's worth mentioning and that's &quot;Angel&quot; by our buddy Sonic<br>
	Boom which contains the `what could I do but care' line from Susie<br>

	<p>
	The more I post to this group, the less I seem to say about the<br>
	Jazz Butcher. Still, here we go again...<br>
	<br>
	I got a note from Mick Bund (ex Felt) in the post today and he says<br>
	that his band, Mexico 70, are releasing their second single<br>
	(&quot;Wonderful Lie&quot;) and first album in the USA during February,<br>
	followed by a small tour in June (to coincide with the World Cup).<br>
	I just thought I'd mention it because they're great and I think<br>
	you'd like them.<br>
	<br>
	But here's a Butch-question:<br>
	<br>
	I was ironing my treasured Jazz Butcher T-shirt the other day when<br>
	I noticed that, heavens!, there's a hole in it.... and worse: the<br>
	design is fading. My life is consequently without meaning - void<br>
	and empty. Does Butch have any merchandise available that I can buy<br>
	to replace this garment? I've only ever seen T-shirts on sale at<br>
	one gig (Borderline, London) and that was a couple of years back.<br>
	<br>
	Butch notwithstanding, it was a cool T-shirt (the New Invention<br>
	trumpet).<br>

	Hi!<br>
	<br>
	That home page is really great! Usually I keep a low profile on this list,<br>
	because I don't have much to say Butch-wise. I have to admit that I didn't<br>
	even go to a show when he played here a few weeks ago :-(<br>
	The next venue would've been 60 km (35 miles) away, and I've been<br>
	quite busy recently.<br>
	<br>
	However, I was so thrilled by that Mosaic thing that I felt compelled<br>
	to express my appreciation ;-)<br>

	howdy from indiana where they tease you with spring.<br>
	<br>
	dont trust it.<br>
	<br>
	i made quite a few cassettes this weekend for those who requested them.<br>
	details upon request - addresses still needed from some.<br>
	<br>
	in-progress: an update to the WWW JBC pages.  the update will include<br>
	some more scans, the entire archives, and maybe even some audio snippets<br>
	once i am happy with the gawdawful quality of this workstation's sampling.<br>
	<br>
	pat just got back from the european tour, and generally he was pretty<br>
	pleased with their performance.  they passed through germany, france,<br>
	switzerland, and holland, played to 100-ish crowds, and made enough<br>
	to get home in the wheezing love bus.<br>
	<br>
	next gig in london will be the 10th of march at the Garage in london.<br>
	<br>
	through europe the line-up was: pat, dooj, nick on drums, and curtis<br>
	as emergency geetarist.  micheal from spittle rattle was along as well.<br>
	curtis and michael were self-contained opening acts, and sometimes pat<br>
	would do his solo bit.<br>
	<br>
	the diversity of the acts has pat thinking hard about exactly what<br>
	the US tour should be..  solo?  rock out?  eg?  right now he doesnt know.<br>
	when?  tentatively late may (yeah, right).<br>
	he wants to be in the states for the World Cup, and is looking for<br>
	some dinking participating country so that he can write their theme music.<br>
	<br>
	he is taking the concept of &quot;the difficult 10th album&quot; very seriously.<br>
	<br>
	with his decade's worth of euro-tour experience, pat is thinking of<br>
	writing a tour book for bands.   included would be things like how<br>
	to ask for a ham and cheese sandwich without the ham in any country,<br>
	to tell the soundman to fuck off politely, maps, places to drink, etc.<br>
	<br>
	waiting still.. US release: 8 March.  honest!<br>
	<br>
	also, very soon will be a creation compilation which includes a track<br>
	from the non-released covers album.<br>
	`everybodys talking' will be the tune on it.<br>

	i have been adding quite a bit to it locally (but i havent yet<br>
	updated the official WWW home page).  things i have added are<br>
	a bunch of photos from tours, and album cover scans.<br>
	still-to-come are audio samples.<br>
	<br>
	which brings me to why i am posting..<br>
	can anyone help me make the album scans more complete?<br>
	thus far, i have scanned:<br>

	so, if you have a color scanner (preferably), and anything not listed<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> talk of references
	<p>
	A while back youall were talking of butcher references to other songs...<br>
	<br>
	in Girls Say Yes:  &quot;It was Almost Brooklyn, it was almost impossible...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	and more lifting from the Velvet Underground:<br>
	from SweetWater:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;There are problems in this world, I know, but right now none of them are mine&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Also:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Hoagy Carmichael never came here, Dave&quot;  referring to David J. song on<br>
	Urban Urbane _Hoagy Carmichael never came to New Orleans_ or something like that.<br>
	<br>
	Or how 'bout this:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Sharin' a room with tough Dave's replacement, looking all the time for a bank&quot;<br>
	<br>
	from Hairbrush and the tank, which is the same song ( with different lyrics)<br>
	as Vandal and the Saint by David J.  Anyone know which came first?<br>
	<br>
	Oh, I thought of one more:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I never dreamed she'd turn up in her own song&quot; &amp; &quot;You wrote a song about going<br>
	to sea&quot;  from Girl Go, from which the music is shared with Perfect Disaster,<br>
	from their song &quot;All the Stars&quot;, which is about going to sea and wanting to jump<br>
	in.  Again, anyone know which came first?<br>
	<br>
	Then, on the topic of sci-fi references:<br>
	<br>
	Does Twin Peaks count?  If so, then count &quot;Honey&quot; from CB.  I can't think of<br>
	any others right now.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	And finally, no more waiting for waiting for the love bus.<br>
	<br>
	I found it in the used section of a small local record store, 8.98, import<br>
	copy.  Joy.  I like it okay, but some of the songs get a little repetitive...<br>
	and there's still not as much lilt in the lyrics, except for sweetwater and<br>
	penguins, and I guess maybe Ben.  I like the feel of Rosemary... but not the<br>
	repetitious listing of sound effect titles.  Ghosts is cool and mello and<br>
	kind of new wave... reminds me of a flock of seagulls.<br>
	<br>
	Angel Station grows on you.  It seems that ever since Angels, Butch has been<br>
	attempting to end his albums with a really killer mellow song, but I don't think<br>
	<br>
	he has written one as good as angels ( i guess that goes without saying ).<br>
	<br>
	Angels (DG)<br>
	Keeping the Curtains Closed (FT) (okay maybe not this one)<br>
	The Good Ones (BPSP)<br>
	Sister Death (CotB)  (I never cared for this one much)<br>
	Racheland (CB)  ++good<br>
	Angel Station (WftLB)  like I said, this one grows on you.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, one last comment and I'm outta here...<br>
	<br>
	How come no one ever talks about &quot;Nothing Special&quot;?  I think that is one<br>
	of his best songs, and it goes hand in hand with Angels... I hardly ever listen<br>
	to the two of them separately.  I've never heard it in concert, though.<br>
	Does Pat have an aversion to this song?  I wonder why they faded out the ending.<br>
	You can still here the end, but it just sort of disappears.  I've tried manually<br>
	adjusting the volume here to hear what it would have sounded like if they didn't<br>
	fade it out, and I think I liked it better.  Oh ah.<br>

	<p>
	I saw a reference to the Jazz Butcher in a Belly interview in the<br>
	latest issue of The Big Takeover (#34).  Jack Rabid was interviewing<br>
	Tanya, and he was telling her how nice Belly is to the bands they<br>
	play with, &lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_press}/94takeover.html&quot;&gt;and Tanya says&lt;/a&gt;<br>
	<br>
	I know it's not much, but I always love seeing any sort of mention <br>
	of the band in print!<br>
	<br>
	I'll second the recommendation on &quot;Betty Blue&quot;.  I really like it a lot,<br>
	though I don't watch it more than once ever other year or so.<br>

	&gt; &quot;I never dreamed she'd turn up in her own song&quot; &amp; &quot;You wrote a song about going<br>
	&gt; to sea&quot;  from Girl Go, from which the music is shared with Perfect Disaster,<br>
	<br>
	golll! I'd always assumed that it was about Shumista Brahm (sp?) who<br>
	wrote &quot;Lost at Sea&quot; but obviously not.... justr shows that I should get<br>
	out more.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Does Twin Peaks count?  If so, then count &quot;Honey&quot; from CB.  I can't think of<br>
	&gt; any others right now.<br>
	<br>
	Well, no. But there's a bit of a lynchy thing going on isn't there?<br>
	Samples from &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; ('He is a sick and dangerous man' is that<br>
	Burglar of Love?) and so on.<br>
	<br>
	Now you've got WFTLB, I'd be interested to hear what you / others think<br>
	about President Chang. I've said it before (but that never stops me) but<br>
	I thought it was a pretty droopy limp song on the album, but live it<br>
	*rocked*. I think it's great now. Do other people like it or am I alone<br>
	in my Road-to-Damascus-type conversion re:president chang?<br>
	<br>
	&gt; How come no one ever talks about &quot;Nothing Special&quot;?<br>
	<br>
	because it's perfect, there's nothing else to say about it. No, really,<br>
	it is. but that bit about neighbours jumping from a thirteenth storey<br>
	window puzzles me. I'm *sure* that's a reference to something else but<br>
	I'm damned if I can remember what it was. Any ideas, anyone?<br>
	<br>
	Oh... which reminds me of the _most obvious_ reference of all: Lot 49.<br>

	<br>

	didya? Never seen Betty Blue but everyone tells me I should... now<br>
	you're all doing it to. Is there no rest until I see it? Why am I<br>

	Ah! Is it really that obvious?  I had actually heard &quot;Looking for Lot 49&quot;<br>
	long before running across Pynchon's _The Crying of Lot 49_.  My friend,<br>
	who had read the book, must have thought I was crazy when I recited the<br>
	lyrics and asked &quot;Does that have anything to do with the book?&quot;<br>
	(As with most of the JBC's references, this one is pretty tangential.)<br>
	Still, I have to give the Butcher credit for introducing me to Pynchon.<br>
	<br>
	Even more tangential Pynchon references might (or might not) be<br>
	&quot;She's A Yo-Yo&quot; and &quot;Racheland&quot;. In _V_, the activity of yo-yo-ing<br>
	(riding back and forth on subways all day) and a character Rachel are<br>
	mentioned. The problem with this is that the actual songs seem to have<br>
	nothing to do with what's in the book, so it just might be a huge<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> GOOSENMK@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu
	<br><b>Subject:</b> HELLO
	<p>
	Just thought I'd introduce myself to other list members.  My name is Miles<br>
	Goosens, and I've been a fan of the Butcher since 1986, when I picked up<br>
	_Bloody Nonsense_ after a review in OPTION magazine called the Butcher &quot;a<br>
	present-day Ray Davies&quot;--as a major Kinks fan, that made him irresistable.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, _Bloody Nonsense_, with its stellar selection of tracks from early<br>
	JBC albums, won me over quickly and I've been following the JBC ever since.<br>
	I've never been able to find the albums BEFORE _Bloody Nonsense_, but I<br>
	have bought all his U.S. releases since.  Having been swept off my feet by<br>
	the wittiness of the Jazz Butcher, the more morose, serious sound of _Cult<br>
	of the Basement_ and _Condition Blue_ took some getting used to--not that<br>
	those albums aren't witty, just that it's usually very black humor indeed--<br>
	but now I love them both.  BTW, is anyone else impressed by how LOUD <br>
	_Condition Blue_ is?  Deceptively loud...I'll put it on in the car at what<br>
	I consider normal volume, and by the time &quot;Shirley MacLaine&quot; is finished, my<br>
	ears are beginning to ring...<br>
	<br>
	If any list members can help me track down CDs of the early JB stuff (_A Bath<br>
	in Bacon_, _Sex and Travel_, _A Scandal in Bohemia_) or of Max Eider's solo<br>
	album, I'd be very grateful.  I'm also up for trading live tapes; though I <br>
	have none of the JBC to swap, I do have a nice collection of R.E.M.,<br>
	Prince, Springsteen, Clash, and _Mountain Stage_ (a U.S. public radio live<br>
	performance show) to deal from, if anyone's interested.<br>
	<br>
	I found this list in _The Internet Directory_ by Eric Braun, and I was <br>
	delighted to discover that this list exists and that there are other Jazz<br>
	Butcher fans out there (I've never met another, personally).  Looking <br>
	forward to hearing from you all.<br>
	<br>
	Later,<br>
	<br>
	Miles Goosens<br>

	Silence equals too much work.<br>
	<br>
	Hey! I got these butchbootlegs in the post the other day and they are<br>
	FAB! No other word.<br>
	<br>
	There's not a lot to say about them to people who don't have them but I<br>
	think I will anyway. Anybody else had any reaction?<br>
	<br>
	Anyone heard this Forum thing where he's supporting John Cale? Is this<br>
	man nervous or what? My heart goes out to the poor man. Not a bad<br>
	performance, either. Still, he is so obviously scared silly - even<br>
	before he says &quot;I'm scared silly&quot; which was a DEAD GIVEAWAY in my<br>
	opinion.<br>
	<br>
	What else? Still working through the Mean Fiddler acoustic set. Not bad.<br>
	The concert I got from way back (1990? Haven't got the box here) is<br>
	quite good. Loads of fun tunes. Brings back memories of, ermm, going to<br>
	see the man Fish, I suppose.<br>
	<br>
	Big surprise: The Third Black Eg album is excellent! I really genuinely<br>
	enjoy it. I mean, we don't expect this to be anything other than an<br>
	extended joke on the part of Butch and - to a certain extent - the<br>
	released album was just about that. But the third one.... wow! I listen<br>
	to it through choice. Especially &quot;I will Survive&quot; and the amusing Gene<br>
	Pitney bits and the obscure bit that sounds like a eurythmics (as in the<br>
	method, not the group) trainer and... oh I could go on. What a total<br>
	revelation. I can hardly wait for their next official release.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I mek heem squeel like a peeg.&quot;<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> domestic release of Waiting For The Love Bus
	<p>
	Has anyone seen it yet?  Sounds like the March 8th date is wrong.<br>
	<br>
	I'm of two minds about this.  One is that this really sucks.  The other is<br>
	that perhaps the record company in charge of distribution (Who is it? <br>
	There was a change, wasn't there?  Sony?) is actually doing something *smart*.<br>
	Given the length of time since WftLB was released in the U.K. (and I presume<br>
	Europe), it would actually make sense to wait until not too long before<br>
	the JBC cross the pond and tour, or the album may just go *fizzle* *pop* and<br>
	disappear.  It would be nice to see the JBC get some much deserved <br>
	recognition...<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC Available in US
	<p>
	In response to Chris Camfield's query re US availability of<br>
	Love Bus: The wait is over. I picked it up Tuesday Mar 22d<br>
	which I believe is the first day it was available in the US.<br>
	If, as is likely, your store hasn't got it, have them special<br>
	order it.  As you probably know, the full title is &quot;Waiting<br>
	for the Love Bus&quot; and the artist is The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy,<br>
	rather than just the Jazz Butcher. That may be important if you<br>
	ask a clerk to look it up on their computer and they're too<br>
	stupid to look down at the next item on the screen. (This nearly<br>
	happened to me: &quot;nope, no such album under The Jazz Butcher...<br>
	oh, waitaminit, here it is under The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy...&quot;)<br>
	It's on Creation/Tri-Star Music. It's manufactured by Sony and<br>
	distributed by Relativity Entertainment Distribution.<br>
	<br>
	I'll post some opinion after I've had more time to digest it.<br>
	Oh yes, the number is WK57563, if that helps anyone oreder it.<br>
	Good luck!<br>

	roughly: 3 sentences or so, no graphics (sigh), grab people's attention, etc.<br>
	<br>
	i hope this would introduce many butcher virgins to the JBC<br>
	our little home here.  maybe the blurb should include (shudder)<br>
	comparisons to other groups?<br>

	Good luck finding this one Sean.  I've never even met anyone that was <br>

	are probably dozens of us that would love to find a copy of<br>
	Bloody Nonsense, Gift of Music, Scandal In Bohemia/Sex And Travel, etc. on CD<br>
	(i.e. the really hard to find ones);<br>
	could the good folks on this jbc list keep an eye out for<br>
	any of them in used cd stores, and if you spot one of them and you already <br>
	own a copy, post a message saying you could get it and the cost.  <br>
	So what's in it for you?  Well I don't really know, just that <br>
	special altruistic feeling I guess.  What d'ya think?<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>

	<br>
	${icon_blank}	brings to mind:<br>
	<br>
	New Invention (BPSP) - &quot;Ancient Rome in your very own home&quot;<br>
	<br>
	both tunes are roughly about TheCaliforniaExperience.<br>
	still i wonder, is there a real place that sells &quot;ancient rome&quot; in CA,<br>
	or was pat just short on images for sweetwater?<br>
	<br>
	i asked him about that song, specifically how the intro is out of place,<br>
	and how the last verse seems forced.<br>
	<br>
	intro - that 8-bar was cut-n-pasted from another tune that never made it.<br>
	last verse - &quot;yeah, so i ran out of ideas&quot;.  or something like that.<br>
	<br>
	i think sweetwater is a good tune that could have been a great tune<br>
	if only the final verse continued with the effortlessness of the first few.<br>

	the JBC WWW stuff chugs happily away at free cycles on my machine,<br>

	<br>
	people who can access the WWW home page may want to give me<br>

	<br>

	${icon_blank}		   listen to excerpts from the Eg interview<br>
	${icon_blank}		5) *then* flee<br>

	<p>
	i just typed in about 2 dozen interviews, reviews, etc, (ouch! i hate that<br>
	damned SHIFT key) which can be found through the WWW page:<br>
	<br>
	i also removed those &quot;.mil site&quot; URLs that UK types were having trouble<br>
	accessing - i have copied that data to my machine, so you should notice<br>
	a speed-up as well, since it makes the downloads smaller.<br>
	<br>
	i am sure that guy from Estonia will appreciate it.<br>
	<br>
	if there is any interest, i can post a few here, but i wanted to check<br>
	so i dont clog up mailboxes...<br>
	<br>
	the latest issue of Creem has a comment about that rumored<br>
	&quot;Creation compilation&quot;, which they claim is also available domestically (US).<br>
	this album will have an as-yet-unreleased track `Everybody's talkin',<br>
	so it may be worthwhile.<br>
	<br>
	any comments on the new one from those who may have picked it<br>
	up state-side?<br>
	<br>
	does anyone have lyrics sitting around that they have transcribed?  no?<br>
	how about putting yourself through the awful torture of listening to<br>

	<p>
	Regarding the Jazz Butcher's views on Robyn Hitchcock:<br>
	<br>
	I don't suppose I need to point the lyrical salute in <br>
	&quot;the Hairbrush &amp; the Tank&quot;: &quot;She said she likes the Soft Boys<br>
	Best...&quot; (this is made to sound like a favorable comment in the<br>
	context of the song.)<br>
	<br>
	Also, on the Cult of the Basement Tour, I spoke briefly to Pat<br>
	while his chums the Aeroplanes were getting ready to play.<br>
	I was wearing a Tshirt with one of those Robyn Hitchcock<br>
	ibis logoes. He said, &quot;Hey, nice T-shirt.&quot; I should add that this<br>
	mild-mannered greeting stands in stark contrast to more surly<br>
	comments I got at a Condition Blue era show, during which I <br>
	was _not_ wearing the Robyn tee.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, I probably deserved what I got for being a fanboy<br>
	doofus...  Anyway, I don't want to start a let's <br>
	criticize/defend Pat Fish thread. I just wanted to point out<br>
	that I thought he was a Hitchcock fan. In fact, I was kind of<br>
	surprised at the affectionately? disparaging comments on RH<br>

	<p>
	i knew there was a reason to take a lunch break today.<br>
	<br>
	the local record store had a promo copy of the new US release:<br>
	The Patron Saints Of Teenage, which contains tracks by various<br>
	Creation artists - Weather Prophets, Biff Bang Pow!, Jasmine Minks,<br>
	Jazz Butcher, The Loft, Slaughter Joe, Momus, Telescopes, Felt,<br>
	Pastels, Bodines, X-men, Revolving Paint Dream, Nikki Sudden,<br>
	and Meat Whiplash.<br>
	<br>
	for those who had to wait for the domestic Love Bus release, the<br>
	last two sentences of this from the liner notes should cheer you up:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Led by the charming Pat Fish (aka Jazz Butcher), this band have been a<br>
	staple on the indie/college circuit of both the US and Europe for quite some<br>
	time now.  Members have included David J of Bauhaus/Love And Rockets fame<br>
	and the legendary Max Eider.  The first half of their career was spent on<br>
	the now defunct Glass Records.  The Jazz Butcher came to the attention of<br>
	US indie fans with the release of Bloody Nonsense, an early &quot;Best Of&quot;<br>
	collection.  This was followed by Distressed Gentlefolk and they have since<br>
	continued to attract fans on both sides of the Atlantic.  In 1988 they<br>
	moved over to Creation, and released Fishcotheque, with Pat Fish brininging<br>
	a new group of musicians on board.  Since then, the Butcher have released<br>
	six albums including Big Planet, Scarey Planet, Cult Of The Basement<br>
	and Condition Blue - all college radio favourites.  Their studio versions<br>
	of `Do You want to Dance?' and that old Fred Neil hit, `Everybody's<br>
	Talking', will be found on their latest release, Waiting For The Love Bus.<br>
	Pay attention!  These tracks are not available on the import version of the<br>
	album!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	damn.  ok.  some of you have the Bus already... is this last bit true?<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Bonus songs
	<p>
	Shoot, there goes my pager...<br>
	<br>
	If I had any idea that our better-late-than-never version of<br>
	_Love Bus_ was in some way superior to the UK version, I'd have<br>
	wasted no time taunting you poor bastards who had the <br>
	(inferior) UK version six months ago. Just kidding, of course,<br>
	but you have to admit he owed us for making us wait so long.<br>
	<br>
	Yes, the US version of _WftLB_ contains studio covers of <br>
	Fred Neil's &quot;Everybody's Talkin'&quot; and Bobby Freeman's &quot;Do<br>
	You Wanna Dance.&quot; They both have certain characteristics that<br>
	one associates with bonus songs: They appear after the <br>
	closing &quot;Rosemary Davis (Reprise)&quot; frame. The arrangement of<br>
	the great Fred Neil song is slow and echo-drenched. It's not<br>
	all that different from Billy Bragg's arrangement of<br>
	another very similar Fred Neil song, &quot;Dolphins&quot; on the last<br>
	Billy Bragg album. It's a short 2.36.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; is by contrast quite long at 6.19. The <br>
	vocal is arranged slow dance style, closer to the (gulp)<br>
	Bette Midler version than any other version I know of. The<br>
	instruments are a combination of drum machine, effects-<br>
	soaked guitars, and synths. It has some of that xylophone/<br>
	marimba work I associate with early Jazz Butcher songs,<br>
	but just a dollop, not too much. <br>
	<br>
	For the youngsters out there, this song was a hit for <br>
	Bobby Freeman in '58, Del Shannon in '64, and the Beach<br>
	Boys in '65. It has also been recorded by the Mamas &amp;<br>
	the Papas in '68, Bette Midler in '73, and of course by<br>
	the Ramones in '78. I understand that it was also a hit<br>
	for Cliff Richard in '62. (Trans-Atlantic note: In the<br>
	UK Cliff Richard is known as that hugely popular and <br>
	famous singer who has been on the charts consistently<br>
	from 1958 to 1994, scoring over a hundred hit singles. In<br>
	the US, he is known as that guy who sang that obnoxious<br>
	song &quot;Devil Woman&quot; in 1976. In fact, he is probably<br>
	best known in the United States as the guitarist in<br>
	the Rolling Stones, but our minds are all addled by<br>
	MTV and Big Macs. Anyway, I get the sense we're not<br>
	missing a whole lot by not having heard those other<br>
	99 or so Cliff Richard songs... Next week on<br>
	TransAtlantic notes: Billy Fury, Adam Faith, Geno<br>
	Washington and the Jam.)<br>
	<br>
	Hmm, sorry for the digression. I wonder whether the <br>
	Canadian version of the new album has these songs<br>
	too...  I saw theposting re Pat in Canada. Does this mean <br>
	he'll be in the States soon?<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> WFTLB
	<p>
	Hi all,<br>
	<br>
	Granted my mind is quite feeble these days; but I can't remember what the <br>
	general consensus is about the new one, WFTLB.  I've only heard Kids in <br>
	the Hall (or something like that, that's the name of a pretty funny <br>
	Canadian comedy show also).  Surprisingly I heard it on the radio!  And <br>
	we're not talking some alternative college station either.  <br>
	Anyway, I wasn't blown away by it and if I want to get the cd I have to <br>
	special order it and its gonna cost about $18.  What do others think of it?<br>
	(BTW, the alternative to me getting WFTLB is me trying to track down a <br>
	copy of Edward's Closet from mail order stores in Canada).<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>
	Glen Davis<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> possible reissues
	<p>
	I was browsing through a recent issue of CREEM magazine (the one with the <br>
	Kate Bush interview --the only reason I bought it), and saw a blurb on <br>
	Creation Records.  It was basically just an announcement about some <br>
	compilation cd that's coming out on a big american label containing <br>
	different Creation bands; among them, the JBC.  I think David mentioned <br>
	something about this cd recently.  Anyway... the important news was that <br>
	I guess some american label is buying and reissuing much of the Creation <br>
	catalog from those that have been long out of print.  No mention of the <br>
	JBC in the reissue area, but with luck the JB may once again be available <br>
	on cd to those of us who missed the first go-around!<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Mean Fiddler: one to watch
	<p>
	The Jazz Butcher Acoustic Conspiracy was:<br>
	Pat Fish - guitar and vocals<br>
	Dave Henderson - guitar<br>
	Dooj - bass and &quot;vocals&quot;<br>
	Gabriel Turner (age 20) - drums (&quot;we don't allow him many yet&quot; - Pat Fish)<br>
	<br>
	In Pat's words, they had been together theoretically for a week, but in<br>
	practice, since lunchtime.<br>
	<br>
	They played:<br>
	Rosemary Davis<br>
	Man with the head of an ass (or whatever that's called)<br>
	Angels<br>
	Monkeyface (?)<br>
	Sweetwater<br>
	Mr Odd<br>
	Sister Death (&quot;bring a packed lunch&quot;)<br>
	Partytime<br>
	She's on Drugs<br>
	Ghosts<br>
	Purple Rain (fragment)<br>
	Soul Happy Hour<br>
	Take the Skinheads Bowling<br>
	Road Runner<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	or something like that...<br>
	<br>
	Incidental question: has the Jazz Butcher ever played a set which did not<br>
	include Mr Odd?<br>
	<br>
	So anyway, it was good. I love the venue, and Pat seemed to be really<br>
	comfortable there too. As usual, paying customers numbered about three. Pat<br>
	brought a fairly hefty entourage down from Northampton, and the support<br>
	acts had  plenty of friends along for moral support too.<br>
	<br>
	The new look conspiracy was in experimental mode, and was less frenetic<br>
	than the band I saw at The Powerhaus, which is probably no bad thing.<br>
	<br>
	But no, I didn't have a recorder on me. :-(<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> London gig... etc.
	<p>
	Argh. I hate that. I was in London on Friday and I missed this bastard Mean<br>
	Fiddler gig. Totally sick about it, can you believe that? ????<br>
	<br>
	Would like to have seen Pat play something more restful, I always seem to<br>
	catch him rockin' out...<br>
	<br>
	Still, no doubt if I had tried to get there, then some horrible public<br>
	transport accident would have conspired to prevent me (see previous two<br>
	attempts to see him play).<br>
	<br>
	I'm curious about this Creation Compilation. It was offered (well, same name -<br>
	different product) as a cut down eight or ten track sampler through some dodgy<br>
	token collecting scheme in a music paper here in the UK (can't remember which<br>
	one). UK version certainly didn't include JBC, Felt, Momus, Nikki Sudden or<br>
	even - surprisingly - Biff Bang Pow!.<br>
	<br>
	Re: &quot;Extra Tracks&quot; on WFTLB... doesn't sound too much like anyone's missing<br>
	anything. Unlike &quot;Fertiliser&quot; on CotB, of course, which I have still NEVER<br>
	HEARD due to my oldy-worldy preference for vinyl. Not that you can buy the<br>
	last three JBC albums on vinyl, of course... grumble.<br>
	<br>
	Speaking of vinyl. I spent the time I should have been planning how to get to<br>
	the Mean Fiddler scouting round some of the more obscure record shops that I<br>
	know in London in a sort of JBC availablility survey type thing. CDs of CotB<br>
	onwards are easy to find. Fishcotheque, BPSP and CotB are all &amp;#163;2.50 on vinyl<br>
	in Cheapo Cheapo Records and, where previously I would wander into Vinyl<br>
	Experience and lovingly gaze upon the Scandal in Bohemia CD, that's now been<br>
	sold. That was the last pre-creation JBC product on sale that I knew of. Looks<br>
	like people wanting to update their scratchy old discs are out of luck...<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> smeats@lincoln.gpsemi.com (Steve Meats LDC 2392)
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Introdution / &quot;Belgium&quot; / JBC Net Alert
	<p>
	It's probably time I introduced myself. I've been loitering in the background,<br>
	but haven't posted anything yet. I am Stephen Meats (a.k.a. Syd Meats) :<br>
	singer/ songwriter/ acoustic performer and pretend electronics engineer.<br>
	<br>
	I first met Pat Fish in about 1989/ 1990ish when we both gave live performances<br>
	on the same radio show. &quot;Boothby Graffoe Live&quot; used to go out from BBC Radio<br>
	Lincolnshire on Friday nights a few years back. The presenter Boothby Graffoe<br>
	( real name James Rogers ) is a stand up comedian. His show was a mixture of<br>
	topical comedy sketches, phone calls and music. My contribution to the show<br>
	was a live song every week. &quot;Graffoe&quot; used to play quite a bit of Jazz Butcher stuff on the show and Pat came to the studio a couple of times ( although he only actually performed once).  Sleeve-notes fans will find that James Rogers<br>
	is creditted with backing vocals on Condition Blue ( he is responsible for<br>
	some of the &quot;Russian&quot; singing ).<br>
	<br>
	Since the days of the Boothby Graffoe shows I've see the JBC perform a  quite<br>
	a few times, but often in more unconventional settings for gigs. I don't <br>
	know if &quot;Belgium&quot; has been mentioned here before, but I'll mention it anyway.<br>
	There's a bar on Bridge Street in Northampton called Slurps, where the JBC give<br>
	the occasional Wednesday night performance. Pat calls it Belgium on account of<br>
	its similarity to a Belgian-type drinking establishment.<br>
	<br>
	The JBC did a &quot;Belgium&quot; on Wednesday 13th April. The line-up was the same as <br>
	for the Mean Fidler (see Matt Cockerill's posting) but with a drum machine in<br>
	place of Gabriel Turner. ( No he hasn't been sacked ! It's only a small venue,<br>
	and it's a long way for him to come up from Bristol .) <br>
	<br>
	The band had a read of Matt's Mean Fidler review and laughed at Dooj's &quot;vocals&quot;<br>
	being put in quotes. Dooj took exception to this, so the band put Matt <br>
	Cockerill in quotes and laughed at him.  The JBC played for about 90minutes.<br>
	The set was similar to the Mean Fidler, but with Betty Page in there somewhere<br>
	and finishing with Goodnight Irene. It was a nice cosy intimate gig. Pat's<br>
	mother had come down from Cumbria to terrorise Northampton with bread rolls<br>
	and Mr Safeway's Vodka.<br>
	<br>
	JBC NET ALERT : Dooj has access to a Mac, although it's not networked. The band<br>

	<p>
	Hi, I've just joined the Jazz Butcher mailing list, and I've been ordered<br>
	to introduce myself to the rest of the list... :)<br>
	I really like the Jazz Butcher, but don't have a whole lot of the albums<br>
	due to the fact that many of them seem to be hard to find, at least around<br>
	here. I've got...umm..._Fishcotheque_, _Big Planet Scarey Planet_, and<br>
	_Cult Of The Basement_. I also have some stuff from the other albums from<br>
	tapes people have sent me. <br>
	Errr...I'm 18, live in Cleveland, Ohio; other bands I like include the<br>
	Young Fresh Fellows, Fastbacks, Big Star, the Kinks, the Posies, Camper Van<br>
	Beethoven, American Music Club, Pink Floyd, Robyn Hitchcock...<br>
	If anyone has info on mail ordering JB records I don't have, please let me<br>
	know...thanks!<br>
	So just how many people are on this list, anyway? Curious...<br>

	<p>
	This is something that I haven't heard discussed much on the list.  Is<br>
	the music media to blame?  Is it simply the music?  I think something<br>
	David posted recently referred to Pat preferring small venues.  Is he<br>
	happy with his level of success?<br>
	<br>
	All I know is that I hate having to hunt so much for releases.  _Waiting<br>
	for the love bus_ has made NO sign of existing in Canada.  This strikes me<br>
	as somewhat stupid.... I thought that there was a good deal of support for <br>
	the JB in Canada.<br>
	<br>
	I don't suppose anyone has the lyrics for &quot;Excellent&quot;, do they?   Great<br>
	silly song... I love the Star Trek quote at the beginning (it's from <br>
	&quot;Menagerie&quot;, as I recall).<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Why is the JBC obscure?
	<p>
	Well, his relative obscurity in the UK was explained by something that I was<br>
	reading in the archives somewhere. ermm...... &lt;curses speed of transatlantic<br>
	www links&gt;....  &lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_press}/90fishy.html&quot;&gt; here:&lt;/a&gt;<br>
	<br>
	&gt; The media in this country are probably the chief culprits. There's no way that<br>
	&gt; a seven-year-old act like the JBC is suddenly going to attract the attention<br>
	&gt; of a press establishment which is falling over itself to find the Next Big<br>
	&gt; Thing before a competitor does. Our time for being `discovered' was probably<br>
	&gt; around 1984 but that was the time we'd just discovered Europe. We had so much<br>
	&gt; fun there that we stayed out of the country until we were considered `old<br>
	&gt; news'. Besides, this country is crazed for mediocricy.<br>
	<br>
	I take NO responsibility for the rest of the article.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I don't suppose anyone has the lyrics for &quot;Excellent&quot;, do they?<br>
	<br>
	&quot;mumble mumble something mumble Brian Wilson, &quot;Vegetables&quot;!&quot; is all I know.<br>
	I think this one might take a bit of work. Mind you, the prize for completely<br>
	incoherent lyric must go to &quot;Blame&quot;.... anyone got any clue? Something about<br>

	Hiya folks. Marsh Gooch from Seattle, WA. I'm new to the list and<br>
	thought I'd introduce myself. Hi. I've been into the JBC since I<br>
	first got hold of Scandal In Bohemia when I was in college radio<br>
	in the early '80s. I've dug them/him ever since. I'm a writer for<br>
	a local music mag, The Rocket, and have reviewed most of the JBC<br>
	releases. <br>
	${icon_blank}	If I'm not mistaken, the latest release is Waiting For <br>
	The Love Bus, right? Or am I sadly behind the times?<br>
	${icon_blank}	Anyhow, I'm a music programmer by day and a budding<br>
	graphic designer by night. Plus I love baseball, writing, and<br>
	am into the following bands (and many more): The Damned, Elvis C.,<br>
	Robyn Hitchcock, XTC, Squeeze, Juliana Hatfield, Belly, Liz<br>
	Phair, Goober &amp; The Peas, etc. etc.<br>
	<br>
	Looking forward to walking and talking and thinking and looking<br>
	and acting like a true JBC fan...<br>

	Chris *still* not drinking? Jeez.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Speaking of obscure JBC stuff, I saw a 12&quot; back in 1991 called &quot;We Love You&quot;.<br>
	&gt; I've never seen or heard about it since.  Info, details?<br>
	<br>
	Well, I'm sure others will fill you in on the details but I think I<br>
	like &quot;We Love You&quot;. (Didn't this appear on the sinful beat tape?)<br>
	<br>
	It's the sort of dancey remix rolling stones oblig cover that they did.<br>
	It appeared on the Creation Dance compilation (&quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;),<br>
	but whether they made it for that or it just so happened that the dance<br>
	compilation came out soon afterwards gawd alone knows.<br>
	<br>
	My (then) flatmate was kept awake to all hours because the intro to the<br>
	&quot;One for the band&quot; mix was just *too* good.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway, I knew about it only through chance and the curious fact that<br>
	it made it up to *No.3* in the/a dance chart in the UK. I had to hunt<br>
	round most of the records shops in the West Midlands to find it and<br>
	even then it was under the counter in plain brown wrapping.<br>
	<br>
	Good dancesque music *and* by the JBC. Truly a great awakening.<br>

	out the full albums from which _Bloody Nonsense_ was culled, so I'll be<br>
	checking that JB section of the record stores' racks regularly in the upcoming<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC gig list - help!
	<p>
	hello everyone.<br>
	<br>
	i am experimenting to a (WWW searchable) database of Jazz Butcher<br>
	gigs, and i am asking for assistance.<br>
	<br>
	i have exhausted my obvious sources, and have come up<br>
	with 188 JBC &quot;events&quot; - 160 of those being regular live shows,<br>
	and those are listed below.<br>
	<br>
	what i need is any additions or corrections to what i have here.<br>
	i am pretty sure that some of the dates for the west coast gigs are wrong..<br>
	although only live shows are listed below, i am trying to gather<br>
	anything not published - interviews, articles, videos, etc.<br>
	<br>
	i have been adding anything known about an &quot;event&quot; -<br>
	the soundman, players, tunes, encores, interviewer, radio station, etc.<br>
	<br>
	for those of you who have been browsing the JBC Home Page,<br>
	this will be incorporated soon through a forms input.<br>
	you will be able to view specific info (such as &quot;interviews&quot;),<br>
	and search for text (when have they played in Austria?, whats<br>
	the last Max gig?).<br>
	<br>
	i may convert the archives to searchable data as well.<br>
	<br>
	ObNewNews - none.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Why is the JBC obscure?
	<p>
	&gt; This is something that I haven't heard discussed much on the list.  Is<br>
	&gt; the music media to blame?  Is it simply the music?<br>
	<br>
	well, it struck me the other day... OK, OK, it struck me about a minute<br>
	ago... that I don't know the answer to this. Bear with me, though. It's<br>
	puzzling, particularly when his old backing band (The Woodentops) can<br>
	release a couple of albums, be known by about a zillion people across<br>
	the globe and even - heaven forbid - get both `proper' studio albums in<br>
	yer actual UK album chart.<br>
	<br>
	Maybe... gulp... The JBC is not all that good? Well, you have to wonder<br>
	if he's an unnoticed rough diamond in a pile of loam or whether it's<br>
	just your abherrant nature that makes you like him. (paste my<br>
	aesthetics 101 coursenotes here) (paste extended diatribe on the fickle<br>
	nature of the entertainment industry as well if you have one).<br>

	<br>
	I think the answer to that is:  What?  As in - definitely not <br>
	Crap. :)  I just (finally!) picked up Waiting For The Love Bus<br>
	(it was a US import, so I don't think it's a domestic release in<br>
	Canada still).  Great album!  I particularly like the album<br>
	versions of Sweetwater, Ghosts, and Penguins.  (I'm comparing<br>
	S and G with the versions from the Mean Fiddler gig a year ago.)<br>
	<br>
	Other things to consider about JB lack of popularity (depressing<br>
	subject, I know) - rather off-the-wall humour that may not appeal<br>
	to everyone, intelligent lyrics which do not cater to the lowest<br>
	common denominator.  What do you think?<br>

	Well, you would say that. I think we need to co-opt some brain<br>

	<br>
	Well, you may be right.... I guess a cursory listen to the earlier<br>
	stuff might give the impression that The Jazz Butcher (crazy name,<br>
	crazy guy!) is some kind of a novelty band. But we know better, huh?<br>
	<br>
	Evidence: I know when I first heard Butch (a phrase that reminds me<br>
	of Swaggart saying &quot;When I met Jesus I was a SINNER&quot;) I was young,<br>
	impressionable and *amused* by it. &quot;Funneeee songs!&quot;. I was kind of<br>
	into novelty at the time so I stuck it out.<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps there's such a thing as being too clever within the popular<br>
	medium...?<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> mojo90210@com.aol
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Why is the JBC obscure?
	<p>
	No, I'm not on the CRAP side at all... he's giving himself the freedom to<br>
	experiment &quot;artistically&quot; if you will, and artists &quot;fail&quot; now and again. I<br>
	see the merits of most everything he does (except &quot;Love Kittens&quot; and &quot;Bigfoot<br>
	Motel&quot; and &quot;Death Dentist&quot; stuff, which is, frankly, crap as only &quot;juvenalia&quot;<br>
	can be...) but I'm not sure if he should be doing art in the middle of his<br>
	otherwise accessible albums. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;Shirley Maclaine&quot; should have been the biggest hit since &quot;Hey Jude&quot; but<br>
	nobody heard it!  Is JBC as obscure in Europe? I'd guess not, but from the<br>
	recent tour diary, it is apparent that they're not playing the festival<br>
	circuit over there, either.<br>
	<br>
	Have we determined if Pat WANTS to be obscure? Kurt Cobain would have traded<br>
	places in a minute from the sound of things. Sounds like the JBC has a blast<br>
	wherever they go, and it's still something of an adventure, so maybe it's for<br>
	the best. <br>
	<br>
	Wouldn't you rather play a cozy, no-pressure set where you could be<br>
	spontaneous and wild, then party with the crowd afterward?  Or would you<br>
	rather be rehearsed to death, choreographed, synchronized, and afraid your<br>
	fans are going to tear you apart if you show your face after the show?<br>
	<br>
	So, it's NOT crap... it's artistic freedom and possibly deliberate obscurity.<br>
	(And lousy record label handling.)<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> a couple of ramblings
	<p>
	A few days ago someone (sorry, I have lost the original message) made a point<br>
	about the early JB being sort of novelty-ish and that perhaps it's possible<br>
	to be too clever for one's own good.  I think that's probably true; how many<br>
	bands of that sort do really really well?<br>
	<br>
	Another thing - on the copy of the Mean Fiddler gig tape, Pat sings a song<br>
	called Waiting for the Love Bus, which isn't on the album.  (At least, not<br>
	my copy!)  Why didn't it make it?  Anyone know if it is going to be a b-side<br>
	or something?  And are there any other tracks with the same names as albums <br>

	<br><b>From:</b> mojo90210@com.aol
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Why is the JBC obscure?
	<p>
	The JBC is obscure simply due to bad record company handling and poor<br>
	management... 99 stores out of 100 don't stock a single JBC title, all his<br>
	early work was on tough to find imports, all the Big Time stuff had a<br>
	fighting chance until the guy went south with the money, screwing several<br>
	fine acts... since, all these other labels have cautiously picked him up on<br>
	the promise of a cult following, but they don't put any promotion behind him,<br>
	so only the cult buys the records. I'd say he has a fighting chance again<br>
	with TriStar, but only if they do something for him, like release a single,<br>
	get him on a movie soundtrack, or better yet a good tour support spot (why<br>
	are the Crash Test Dummies opening for the Costello tour? Or Sheryl Crow for<br>
	Crowded House? Why not the JBC? Poor management!)  JBC should offer to play<br>
	the second stage at Lollapalooza for FREE! Something to get this fine<br>
	performer in front of the public.<br>
	<br>
	The fact that the records are usually remarkably uneven doesn't help.<br>
	&quot;Condition Blue&quot; is about the only one where all the songs are &quot;accessible&quot;<br>
	to the general listener. The new one is accessible, but not nearly as<br>
	good...no rockers on it either, and that &quot;President Chang&quot; song pisses me off<br>
	no end...<br>
	<br>
	No, the Butcher seems to be following all the instructions in the book &quot;How<br>
	to become a cult band.&quot;  And I think he knows it.<br>
	<br>
	BTW, any word out there on a new Max Eider album? &quot;Best Kisser&quot; is as good as<br>
	almost any JBC release...<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Why is the JBC obscure?
	<p>
	Update...  I stirred a bit by suggesting something along the lines that<br>
	saying:<br>
	<br>
	&gt; The fact that the records are usually remarkably uneven doesn't help.<br>
	<br>
	is a crafty way of siding with the &quot;Crap&quot; side of &quot;Crap or what?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	As a nerdy record release note, it's worth pointing out to those who don't<br>
	know that &quot;Shirley Maclaine&quot; never got a UK (Europe?) single release. &quot;Girl<br>
	Go&quot; was the last single, wasn't it?<br>
	<br>
	But ain't there a good point here? I can't imagine Pat filling or really<br>
	truly deep down wanting to fill Wembley Stadium with 35,000 adoring fans<br>
	and sell T-Shirts at $40 a piece.  Even if he were, in some parallel<br>
	universe, amazingly popular. There aren't many songs that would sit<br>
	comfortably with a Pink Floydy son et lumiere of lasers and pyrotechnics. I<br>
	can barely comprehend the possibility of a giant inflatable love kitten<br>
	floating over Battersea Power Station....<br>
	<br>
	It's maybe that the music and the teeny fan base seem so suited to each<br>
	other that I can't help but think relative obscurity is what he wants<br>
	anyway. Else maybe he'd write a stadium rocker like what James did. It<br>
	can't be *that* difficult. (No doubt he'll read that and get annoyed.)<br>
	<br>
	Time to start a &quot;keep the jbc obscure&quot; campaign.<br>

	<p>
	G'day guys,<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     The new catalogues arrived yesterday - Waiting for the Love Bus can be<br>
	ordered in Tasmania! Whee!<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     This information made me feel less bad about coming home from work early<br>
	with a stomach virus (ugh, winter). So while I'm here, a few random thoughts...<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Robyn Hitchcock: Never heard of until yesterday I found a second-hand<br>
	copy of &quot;Queen Elvis&quot;. Nice album - I really liked about three tracks on it.<br>
	I can see why Jazz Butcher fans would like it.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Cult Of The Basement: Is there an album anywhere that grows on you more<br>
	than this one? Being a self-confessed &quot;Early JBC Fan&quot;, and basically driving my<br>
	flatmates nuts by endless playing of songs like &quot;Peter Lorre&quot;, &quot;Elephant&quot;,<br>
	&quot;The Devil is my Friend&quot; and &quot;Jazz Butcher v Prime Minister&quot;, the first time<br>
	I listened to CoTB I only liked &quot;Panic In Room 109&quot; and &quot;My Zeppelin&quot;. Now I<br>
	just can't stop humming &quot;The Onion Field&quot; and &quot;Pineapple Tuesday&quot; all the<br>
	time. Does Pat ever play &quot;The Onion Field&quot; in a set? <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Western Family: OK, I remember the list dumped all over it one time, but<br>
	it has never been spotted in an Australian catalogue, and I nearly whooped when<br>
	I found a second-hand copy in Melbourne at Easter. I still like it (worth it<br>
	for the slower versions of &quot;Sister Death&quot; and &quot;Still And All&quot;) - but does<br>
	anoyne know what possessed Pat to slow down &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot; and take<br>
	out the line &quot;Thousands of people are queuing in the rain to meet the Pope&quot;<br>
	(well the whole verse)?<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Oh well, the wait is almost over. Sorry about the long rant, have fun<br>
	guys!<br>
	<br>
	The Jazz Butcher's biggest Tasmanian fan<br>
	George<br>
	<br>
	P.S. Am I ever going to get to see the band down here? Not bloody likely, I<br>

	<br>
	That's funny, just the other day I was joking to someone that I was convinced<br>
	(I use that word gratuitously) that the song was all about the movie Running<br>
	Man.  (The Butcher of Bakersfield was what they called him).  That and the<br>
	line 'I wanna be your top eliminator'.  But frankly, I really haven't listened<br>
	to the song that closely (it doesn't really do anything for me) and I don't<br>
	really know the movie all that well either.  Oh ah.<br>
	&gt; <br>
	&gt; I suppose it's a funny category, but I think that Sweetwater has to<br>
	&gt; qualify as the most &quot;up&quot; song I've heard from the Butcher.  <br>
	<br>
	I take it this song is about the joint in Los Osos?<br>
	<br>
	Someone earlier mentioned that they thought the third verse was forced.  I<br>
	re-listened and I'd sort of agree, although I'm not really sure what it means,<br>
	and it seems like more of a break than a verse cos it's only two lines, and<br>
	I can forgive a break lyric that I don't understand (see Nothing Special &amp;<br>
	neighbors)<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Let's see, Sweetwater about a place in Los Osos.  Bakersfield.  Pineapple tuesday about driving in LA (Venice, if that's the same Beethoven street I know).<br>
	Any more songs that mention places in California?  Oh yeah, Hysteria--San Francisco.<br>

	<p>
	&gt; Another thing - on the copy of the Mean Fiddler gig tape, Pat sings a song<br>
	&gt; called Waiting for the Love Bus, which isn't on the album.  (At least, not<br>
	&gt; my copy!)  Why didn't it make it?  Anyone know if it is going to be a b-side<br>
	&gt; or something?  And are there any other tracks with the same names as albums <br>
	&gt; but which aren't part of the album?<br>
	<br>
	Mmmm, on that tape, did he say it was an old song by the apartments?<br>
	Perhaps he didn't feel like naming the album after a cover that was on the<br>
	album, but didn't mind naming after the song, and the revered vehicle.<br>
	<br>
	?<br>

	<p>
	&gt; The fact that the records are usually remarkably uneven doesn't help.<br>
	&gt; &quot;Condition Blue&quot; is about the only one where all the songs are &quot;accessible&quot;<br>
	&gt; to the general listener. The new one is accessible, but not nearly as<br>
	&gt; good...no rockers on it either, and that &quot;President Chang&quot; song pisses me off<br>

	<br>
	Was the person who commented thusly about president chang privy to pat's<br>
	explanation of the song title's origin?<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	Bakersfield is a place a couple of hours<br>
	north of Los Angeles where seekers after Purity Of Tone stand in the<br>
	desert and watch drag racing before cruising the bars of this fine<br>
	and patriotic borough, and maybe stopping by at one of its lifestyle<br>
	motel complexes.  This particular tune was inspired by a conversation<br>
	in Boardner's Bar, Hollywood, with Iain O'Higgins and Col Coonce of<br>
	the Braindead Sound Machine, whose subsequent attempts to lend<br>
	decency to the whole concept are never going to wash with this writer.<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> bj835@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Tim Connors)
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Bakersfield
	<p>
	Chris Camfield asked about the significance of Bakersfield, and<br>
	Pat's discussion seemed to presume a certain familiarity with <br>
	the place as well. Here's a quickie background note:<br>
	<br>
	Bakersfield is indeed a town in California, some distance North<br>
	of LA. Bakersfield is the home to some big oil fields (I think<br>
	the oil rig scenes in _Five Easy Pieces_ are supposed to be <br>
	there. After the war a lot of Texans and other Southerners came<br>
	to Bakersfield to work in these oil fields. Because of this <br>
	migration, Bakersfield developed a country music scene with lots<br>
	of honky tonks and country bars like Pat described, and later <br>
	with a fair number of recording studios and record labels.<br>
	<br>
	During the late '50s and early '60s, as the sound coming out of<br>
	Nashville became glossier and poppier, Bakersfield became the<br>
	locus of a back-to-basics movement in country music. The <br>
	leading proponent of the &quot;Bakersfield Sound&quot; was Buck Owens, who<br>
	is probably best remembered by most in the States as one of the<br>
	hosts of &quot;Hee Haw,&quot; but who released lots of great country<br>
	records in the '50s and '60s.<br>
	<br>
	In the '70s, LA became the center of the early country rock<br>
	scene, due to the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield. Various<br>
	Byrd spinoffs like Dillard &amp; Clark and the Flying Burrito<br>
	Bros. mixed some of the California bluegrass and country <br>
	session guys into their records. These great early <br>
	experiments were later watered down into the lame country<br>
	rock of the '70s, like the Eagles and Poco.<br>
	<br>
	In the early '80s some of the &quot;cowpunk&quot; bands and fellow<br>
	travelers like Dwight Yoakam spent lots of time in <br>
	Bakersfield as well. To this day the place has a rep for<br>
	rootsy country music, as opposed to the countrypolitan<br>
	sounds that generally hold sway in Nashville.<br>
	<br>
	Sorry for any glaring errors or omissions, this is off the<br>
	top of my head. Hope it's of some interest.<br>

	1 June - London, Sound Shaft the BLACK EG LIVE DEBUT<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	the buzz about this show occurring caused (ex bassist)<br>

	${icon_blank}	the artist pascal legras is flying in from Paris for it.<br>
	<br>

	${icon_blank}	fourth member, and he will be in a wheelchair.<br>
	${icon_blank}	eggs will be worn on heads, and pat said that<br>

	${icon_blank}	while standing stone-faced at the back of the stage.<br>

	<br>
	${icon_blank}	apparently much use will be made of the 4-track,<br>
	${icon_blank}	czech samples throughout (for that authenticity factor),<br>
	${icon_blank}	and there will be little effort to leave the techno-club<br>
	${icon_blank}	audience &quot;wanting more&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	the guy who invited/challenged the Black Eg to perform<br>
	${icon_blank}	asked &quot;how are the brothers usually paid?&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	to which karel responded &quot;in diesel&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	4 June - Royal Albert Hall - JBC, Creation 10th anniv show &quot;unplugged&quot;<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	lots of Creation acts are playing, and pat feels this<br>
	${icon_blank}	will be an angry show.  he was considering how the<br>
	${icon_blank}	brothers von d&amp;auml;mmerung would perform &quot;unplugged&quot; had they<br>
	${icon_blank}	been asked...(after all, they are on Creation):<br>
	${icon_blank}	&quot;like Crosby, Stills, Nash and Dooj - sitting in rocking chairs,<br>
	${icon_blank}	wearing overalls, and each holding a jam box, fingers lifted<br>
	${icon_blank}	from pause buttons at appropriate moments.<br>
	${icon_blank}	total cost of performance: &amp;#163;5 - for batteries.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	see you at the shows, i hope.<br>
	anyone know where the Sound Shaft is?<br>
	<br>
	other stuff..<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	I've just been introduced by a friend to the world of WWW, and of course I<br>
	started with the JB pages.  Kudos to David for very fine work!  I was<br>
	flattered by the appearance of my transcription of La Mer, and delighted<br>
	to find typed-up lyrics to so many of the songs from WftLB.  I like to<br>
	know all the words, myself...  BTW David I think it's &quot;Alsation barking&quot; in<br>
	Rosemary DaviS...  or however one spells that breed of dog...<br>
	<br>
	The first time I listened to Whaddya, I thought it was a pretty song, <br>
	thought I had it worked out, and then got to the ending!  Wow!  Talk <br>
	about a change, I think my blood ran a little cooler.  Flipped the whole <br>
	song around.  Very good song IMO.<br>

	there is a story here...<br>
	<br>
	there is a wonderful little book about STRANGE things to<br>
	see when cruising the states entitled Roadside America.<br>
	(2nd edition, Paragon Press)<br>
	<br>
	the book is broken up into catagories like &quot;large concrete animals&quot;,<br>
	&quot;real live freak shows&quot;, &quot;obscure churchs&quot;, etc.<br>
	<br>
	pat came into possession of one of these books at the end of the<br>
	tour, and by the time i thumbed through it, pat had obviously<br>
	been smitten with the story about the guy (tiny) who would<br>
	stage a show where you could watch him wrestle to near-death with his<br>
	alligator (clyde) for anyone who wanted to drop by and watch.<br>
	<br>
	i say obvious, because starting with the cover of the book,<br>
	and apprearing every 5 pages or so would be things that pat had<br>
	penned in like: &quot;Also starring Tiny &amp; Clyde!&quot;  &quot;Tiny &amp; Clyde,<br>
	50 miles&quot;, &quot;next exit, Tiny &amp; Clyde&quot;, &quot;Dont miss Tiny &amp; Clyde!&quot;.<br>

	&quot;Whooaa!  you missed Tiny &amp; Clyde&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	great, great book.<br>
	<br>
	non-obvious %70 truth:  the rachel of `Racheland' is the<br>

	A reliable source in the pub told me last night that the Creation 10th<br>
	anniversary &quot;unplugged&quot; show at the Albert Hall is to be broadcast by<br>
	Radio One. I think this will be a live broadcast, but I doubt if it will<br>
	cover the whole thing. Don't be surprised  if radio listeners join the show<br>
	just AFTER the JBC set !<br>
	<br>
	At any rate, with all that broadcast equipment there you can bet anything you<br>
	like that a quality live recording will end up somewhere ( even if it doesn't<br>
	get officially released ).<br>
	<br>
	Waiting for some well-informed smart-arse to fill in the details ..........<br>

	I can now confirm that I'll be at the Black Eg debut. Not sure about the<br>
	Albert Hall thing though.<br>
	<br>
	Tomorrow is the &quot;Unplugged&quot; Jazz Butcher gig which I'm putting on in Lincoln,<br>
	and performing at. As you can imagine, I'm dead nervous about the whole thing.<br>
	I think the worst thing that can happen is too many people turning up ( it's<br>
	only a small room ). There have been quite a few phone calls asking where the<br>
	venue is, but no-one is flying in from abroad as far as I know ( Pascal<br>
	Legras has some floorboards to varnish ).<br>

	&gt; Where in London is the Sound Shaft, anybody???<br>
	<br>
	Let me demystify you on this one. (Ed finally proving to be of some use.)<br>
	<br>
	The Sound Shaft is on Hungerford Lane, off Craven Street.  For those who<br>
	lack an A-Z, you'll find this down the side of Charing Cross station. I<br>
	*think* Craven Street comes out next to Boots, but I could be wrong. It's<br>
	on that side of the station anyway and before you get to Northumberland<br>
	Avenue.<br>
	<br>
	Plans are rather dependent upon the way that overnight travel affects my<br>
	brain, but I *think* David and I and assorted unwitting volunteers who<br>
	don't know THE TRUTH might be drinking a couple of pints in the Duke of<br>
	Wellington / Wellington Tavern / &quot;that pub credited on the sleeve of<br>
	Fishcotheque&quot; up to about 8ish. That pub's to be found on Waterloo Road,<br>
	almost exactly opposite the appropriate exit from the main Waterloo<br>
	station. Hell, you know that anyway. It's only a shortish walk over<br>
	Hungerford Bridge to the venue from there.<br>
	<br>
	I mention the pub because it might be easier to spot everyone outside the<br>
	venue rather than inside... that said - the music the club plays is<br>
	ambiguously described as &quot;techno funk&quot;, whatever that is, so I guess the<br>
	JBC fans should be quite easy to spot in amongst the melee.<br>
	<br>
	Two hours until my train leaves... this had better be worth it.<br>

	Here's my analysis of the Black Eg concert.<br>
	Don't drink too much Grolsch. It makes yer head hurt.<br>
	<br>
	I hadn't heard the Black Eg album, but hadn't really heard good reports of it.<br>
	I found the live show very impressive, if perhaps a little samey after a while.<br>
	I was also getting very drunk, having already spent some time outside the<br>
	Sherlock Holmes with the Von D&amp;auml;mmerung brothers while they were spraying their<br>
	eggs. It is quite possible the performance was given under the influence<br>
	of spray-paint, but this probably helped.<br>
	<br>
	In any event, I left before the end, nothing to do with the performance but <br>
	because the friends I was staying with in London were leaving and I was <br>
	probably too out of it to find my own way back.<br>
	<br>
	It was interesting to see some faces to a few of the names on this list. It's<br>
	a pity my meeting with you was little more than a brief handshake, but there<br>
	you are.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for the tape, Dave. I was amused to hear myself described as &quot;sick <br>
	diseased and bitter&quot; on the WRAS interview.<br>
	<br>
	I apologise to those of you I led to believe that Radio One was to broadcast<br>
	the Albert Hall thing. Apparently this was the original plan, but they<br>
	broadcast live from Donnington instead. The show was recorded, but I don't<br>
	yet know when it's going out.<br>

	${icon_blank}	The barman was quite amusing.<br>
	<br>

	${icon_blank}	Repetitious<br>
	${icon_blank}	Not much bass or tune to recognise except for that &quot;Filth&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}						    bit (I'm told)<br>
	${icon_blank}	The Night Bus back	<br>
	<br>
	Actually, the biggest disappointment was that they actually tried to<br>
	make it kinda dancy and they didn't try and repeat the Black Eg album<br>
	tracks. I would have gladly paid twice as much to see the genuine,<br>
	original Eg material rather than what turned out to be a mediocre<br>
	techno attempt by people wearing silly egg hats. Particularly in that<br>
	club, to that audience. I guess that's sort of implied by the lists<br>
	above.<br>
	<br>
	I suppose it's astonishing that it happened at all and for that we<br>
	should be grateful. Glad I went to see it... honestly.<br>

	&gt; It was interesting to see some faces to a few of the names on this<br>

	catching up..<br>
	&gt; muck@elm.circa.ufl.edu<br>
	&gt; was wondering when they would return to the states?<br>
	<br>
	there may be bad news here.  i asked pat about this and he mentioned<br>
	that if distribution in north america doesnt speed up, they may sit this<br>
	tour out.  more should be known in a month or so (i *know* that is<br>
	what is always said..)<br>

	&gt; a suspicious lack of 'analysis' of the Black Eg concert.<br>
	&gt; Does anyone have any opinions or are we keeping quiet for a reason?<br>
	<br>
	yeah, well it took me several hours to plow through my mail,<br>
	and i got back from chicago this morning.  thats my excuse.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; smeats@lincoln.gpsemi.COM<br>
	&gt; Here's my analysis of the Black Eg concert.<br>
	&gt; Don't drink too much Grolsch. It makes yer head hurt.<br>
	<br>
	syd was nearly completely out of it.  at least i didnt see<br>
	him with his eyes closed like SOME people.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I found the live show very impressive,<br>
	&gt; if perhaps a little samey after a while.<br>
	<br>
	thats a good description.<br>
	<br>
	the gig was hidden in arches between buildings, and was actually<br>
	in the club Heaven.  once a week a room there turns into a disco<br>
	with DJs - one of whom is named &quot;horton jupiter&quot; - he put the show on.<br>
	<br>
	the room itself was small - about 50ft square, but it had stairs up to<br>
	another room which opened so you could see the dance floor.  it was on<br>
	this upper level that the Black Eg set up and played.  those on the dance<br>
	floor never really saw the band - if they looked up through the fog, they<br>
	may have seen some pointy black heads or thumbs.<br>
	<br>
	the show was sandwiched between sets of DJs spinning and was three tunes,<br>
	each 15 minutes long with little feed-backy bits in between.<br>
	<br>
	depending what you were expecting, this was either boring, or interesting.<br>
	the beats were just slightly less white-boy than from, say, the JBC tune<br>
	&quot;Line Of Death&quot;, but it was the right tempo to dance to.  the best part<br>
	was what was done over the top of the beats.<br>
	<br>
	kurt played guitar through delays mostly and he provided dreamy feedback<br>
	and pseudo heavy metal solos on occasion.<br>
	emil is still pig and he manned (egged?) the 4-track which had the samples<br>
	and drones and other backwards guitar parts.<br>
	otto played with a cheesy synth with which he would do LFO sweeps and<br>
	plinky sounds.<br>
	karel was in a wheelchair and did nothing but circle the room,<br>
	bumping into people.<br>
	<br>
	the interplay between the synth and the guitar was good.  even though<br>
	the dancers would have moved to nearly anything.<br>
	<br>
	horton at the end could be heard &quot;singing&quot; the stars and stripes forever<br>
	with the slogan of the night &quot;Yhet Abrdige!&quot; (well, thats phonetically<br>
	about right - it means &quot;fuck off&quot; in czech.<br>
	<br>
	horton (the club owner) would love to put out a re-mixed single of<br>
	eg material, but emil is hesitant to do so.  his accent was difficult,<br>
	but i think he was telling me that the eg do not want to play indiscrimiately,<br>
	which, i guess is why they chose to play the sound shaft - it was &quot;right&quot;<br>
	for them.  i personally think he is afraid to become popular.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Thanks for the tape, Dave. I was amused to hear myself described as &quot;sick <br>
	&gt; diseased and bitter&quot; on the WRAS interview.<br>
	<br>
	this from the man who writes tunes like<br>
	&quot;you're so indifferent (you think this song might be about you)&quot; and<br>
	&quot;the involuntary bowel movement of love&quot;.  dont even try to convince<br>
	me otherwise, syd.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; edwardc@aisb.edinburgh.ac.uk<br>
	&gt; Actually, the biggest disappointment was that they actually tried to<br>
	&gt; make it kinda dancy and they didn't try and repeat the Black Eg album<br>
	&gt; tracks.<br>
	<br>
	ed, i dont think that had they attempted an album re-creation it<br>
	would have gone over too well.  it was a dance club, what they were<br>
	doing was already on the edge of acceptability for that type of crowd.<br>
	<br>
	the recording i made is decent.  the (what i call interesting) parts<br>
	are very clear, while the boom boom boom is less so, which is fine.<br>

	<p>
	Re: Black Eg and Undrugged....<br>
	<br>
	Black Eg: Sound Shaft (mezanine of Heaven, under Charing Cross<br>
	${icon_blank}	  arches), 1st June <br>
	<br>
	I met up with David, Ed and his mate in the Duke of Wellington<br>
	resolute that I would not go to the Black Eg gig, just have a drink<br>
	and then hop on the train at Waterloo.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, one thing led to another and I was persuaded to come<br>
	along. I had already paid good money to buy the Black Eg album, listened to<br>
	it, thought it was utter crap and fortunately for humanitarian reasons<br>
	it was stolen from my car (there is a probably a deranged French thief<br>
	wandering the streets of Toulon shouting ``Emil is no pig''). I wasn't<br>
	too happy spending good money after bad, but for only &amp;#163;3 a throw, who<br>
	can grumble.<br>
	<br>
	Going to Heaven was definitely an uplifting experience - seeing at<br>
	first hand want these `young' people get up to these days. Apart from<br>
	the interminal wait, the show was far better than I expected, although<br>
	techno funk isn't really my scene. The guitar feedback certainly made<br>
	it sound like `real' music. Through exhaustion and the prospect of a<br>
	10 mile cycle ride home, I left about 1.30AM. Apparently the gig<br>
	finished shortly after I left.<br>
	<br>
	The gig was probably worth the money but probably not worth the<br>
	endless wait for the ``the first and only debut of the brothers and<br>
	their cousin Kurt''. <br>
	<br>
	Undrugged: Albert Hall, 4th June<br>
	<br>
	Mike Kelly and myself arrived about 7.30PM, just in time to see the<br>
	end of Peter Astor. In the very under populated Albert Hall, who<br>
	should be sitting in the row behind us but David! ``In all the bars,<br>
	in all the towns, etc., etc.''. It's a small world really.<br>
	<br>
	All of the early bands played only one song (Peter Astor, BMX Bandits,<br>
	etc.). The Jazz Butcher came on and there were shouts of ``Emil is not pig''<br>
	from around us - we were apparently implanted in the hot bed of JBC<br>
	supporters. They played one song - She's on Drugs, probably the best<br>
	song of the show (biased as I am) although you couldn't hear the<br>
	saxophone. David is the man to give you the full line up...<br>
	<br>
	Highlights: Oasis and one of the Reids from Jesus and Mary Chain<br>
	${icon_blank}	    saying f**k a lot<br>
	<br>
	Lowlights: The Creations (over the hill hippies), Ride (under the hill<br>
	${icon_blank}           hippies)<br>
	<br>
	Mega-lowlights: Ride and The Creations playing together! There was<br>
	${icon_blank}	this perfect synergy - take two bad bands, let them play together and<br>
	${icon_blank}	they are worse than the sum of their wholes!<br>
	<br>
	All in all not a bad evening - shame the JBC only played one song and<br>
	Oasis are probably worthing checking out.<br>
	<br>
	Later<br>
	<br>
	Your London Corresponent<br>

	<p>
	this letter is a more a report of my week than anything else.<br>
	there are a couple of facts you may find of interest..<br>
	<br>
	tues 31mar - drive to chicago, leave the car at martin's, fly, smoke,<br>
	${icon_blank}	drink, record the nice British Airlines relaxation tape,<br>
	${icon_blank}	see the nice documentary on emperor penguins (they ... head South)<br>

	${icon_blank}	CS gas canisters at local kiddie party supply store.<br>
	${icon_blank}	find joe at the wellington, walk walk eat bad pizza, walk walk<br>
	${icon_blank}	attempting to find the sound shaft, meet a stumbling syd,<br>
	${icon_blank}	re-meet matt, make my presence known to the astonished<br>
	${icon_blank}	&lt;iMG SRC=&quot;${eg_images}/segdebut.gif&quot;&gt;<br>
	${icon_blank}	von d&amp;auml;mmerungs, dance, sweat, drink, high scores at pinball,<br>
	${icon_blank}	accompay ed with my home on my back, walk at 4am past menacing cats<br>
	${icon_blank}	to the couch i will sleep on for the next 3 nights.<br>
	thu 2jun - sleep, eat, drink, sleep<br>
	fri 3jun - beautiful day! traverse london many times depositing<br>
	${icon_blank}	Vergiftung cassettes at unsuspecting record labels.<br>
	${icon_blank}	FINALLY find the Malt&amp;Hops (not on pentonville road) and<br>
	${icon_blank}	play pinball with ed.  no high scores.<br>
	sat 4jun - rain, wait outside the albert hall forever with others<br>
	${icon_blank}	for creation to deliver the magic undrugged envelopes.<br>
	${icon_blank}	the royal albert hall is BIG.  the royal albert hall is boomy.<br>
	${icon_blank}	the royal albert hall is unsuited to bands playing acoustic<br>
	${icon_blank}	guitars.  it is suited to bands with orchestras (as the boo<br>
	${icon_blank}	radleys had).  improbably, joe and mr kelly have tickets located<br>
	${icon_blank}	very near to me. joe gets scolded by the red coats for using a flash.<br>
	${icon_blank}	joe puts his camera away but later braves a cigarette.<br>
	${icon_blank}	there are 14 or 18 bands, the JBC are about 6th.  as they come<br>
	${icon_blank}	on, shouts of &quot;YHET ABRIDGE&quot; accosted them from around the auditorium.<br>
	${icon_blank}	alex green is not heard due to the over-burdened soundmen.<br>

	${icon_blank}	marvel at the idiot on the unicycle and the DJs.  dance, see paul<br>
	${icon_blank}	mulreany in the crowd, get brushed off by laurence &quot;if you're not<br>
	${icon_blank}	female don't bother talking to me&quot; o'keefe.  escort horton jupiter<br>
	${icon_blank}	(the guy who sponsored the black eg show) home along with 8 others<br>
	${icon_blank}	he picked up for a party at his home.  paid a stranger in big car<br>
	${icon_blank}	to deliver us at his door, since taxis refuse more than 4.<br>

	${icon_blank}	no sleep until weellll past dawn.<br>
	sun 5jun - awaken in quickly approaching smelly rumpled clothes, peruse and<br>
	${icon_blank}	sample some of horton's marvellous record collection and his plastic<br>
	${icon_blank}	piano before leaving late in the day for northampton.<br>
	${icon_blank}	ride the hour to the city of fish where pat is thoughtfully at the<br>
	${icon_blank}	station to pick me up on a borrowed mountain bike.  we walk to<br>
	${icon_blank}	Belgium have some Budvar, then to the home he shares with little jake<br>
	${icon_blank}	and kathie. lots of talk under the influence of alcohol, but i<br>
	${icon_blank}	vaguely remember stuff about computers and music. zzz.<br>
	mon 6jun - a sunday-like day without much walking!  re-met crazy bob, and<br>
	${icon_blank}	dave ilmore (of indy racing-car fame) both of whom stopped by for<br>
	${icon_blank}	recreational conversation. took some gratuitous pictures of pat<br>
	${icon_blank}	and kathie in front of the LuvBus.  pat was called upstairs by the<br>
	${icon_blank}	telephone - 5 minutes later he calls me up and tells me that<br>
	${icon_blank}	&quot;dev from Musician Magazine would like to talk to you&quot;  &quot;me?&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	dev was doing an article on bands and the internet and he somehow<br>
	${icon_blank}	got wind of the jbc-list. look for it at a stand near you soon.<br>
	${icon_blank}	then out to an overhot pub with spittle rattle and shrike folk<br>
	${icon_blank}	and Death Cigarettes (really, thats their name).  sleeplessly dubbed<br>
	${icon_blank}	some tapes until the taxi came to take me away.<br>
	tue 7jun - played the dupe in the &quot;spot the tourist&quot; game as i allowed the<br>
	${icon_blank}	euston tube escalator to attack my ankles. at heathrow, gawked at the<br>
	${icon_blank}	concorde and climbed on board the lowly 747.<br>
	${icon_blank}	the passenger next to me was czech.  i threw what little czech<br>
	${icon_blank}	i knew at him.  i started safe.  &quot;yees, kazak koureni means<br>
	${icon_blank}	`no smoking'&quot;, he says, smiling.  when asked what &quot;Yhet abridge&quot; means,<br>
	${icon_blank}	he quietly tells me to enjoy my meal and ignores me the rest of<br>
	${icon_blank}	the flight.<br>
	${icon_blank}	i needed the sleep anyway.<br>

	&gt; I've got to agree with Syd...Condition Blue's an awfully good record<br>
	<br>
	Heaven forfend that I should chip in to any &quot;Condition Blue: crap or what?&quot;<br>

	here first, second and probably third time round. This is the last, I hope.<br>
	<br>
	The problem that I have with this album is that it is just SO self indulgent.<br>
	For whatever reason, probably to fit the 10,000 guitarists on, the tunes are<br>
	sometimes rather reluctant to end... clipping a couple of minutes off most<br>
	tracks (see esp. &quot;harlan&quot;) might help. Basically: nice songs, but boring.<br>
	<br>
	Whether we should criticise the self indulgent *content* is a little more<br>
	open to debate. While I appreciate its status as a therapy record, there's<br>
	a little devil inside me which says &quot;Why is he releasing this? What's it<br>
	all about? Why should I care? Why should I have to listen to it?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Oh yeah, there are good bits as well. Racheland is a rare treat, that's<br>
	beyond question (I hope).<br>
	<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Condition Blue = Masterwork
	<p>
	Do people on the list generally feel that Waiting For The Love Bus is a <br>
	*letdown* after Condition Blue?  In my opinion, Pat hasn't had an uneven<br>
	album since Big Planet Scarey Planet, which got overproduced by whoever it<br>
	was (I tried to access the WWW page - is it down?).<br>
	<br>
	I'm really beginning to hate the &quot;novelty music&quot; label that gets pasted<br>
	on Pat's humorous songs.  I *would* label most of what he wrote before<br>
	Fishcoteque as novelty music, but is all music that is humorous automatically<br>
	(borderline) novelty music?  Isn't Burglar of Love a cool song?  How about<br>
	She's On Drugs?  Besides whether a song has good music and good lyrics,<br>
	what does it matter if a song makes you laugh or smile?  Sheesh.  Most<br>
	pop music is unending drivel about love, in 1001 different variations.<br>
	I'd rather have humour than yet another bad love song, how about you?<br>
	But I'm sure mainstream pop stations would choose another bad love song<br>
	over a genuinely funny JB song.  *smirk*<br>
	<br>
	It's interesting (to me) that two points of contention about Condition Blue<br>
	are paralleled in discussions on other mailing lists I read.  I won't go<br>
	into a huge amount of detail, but both Condition Blue and Sting's The Soul<br>
	Cages were inspired by pain and were self-therapy (and the fans on the <br>
	mailing list who consider it his best solo work are in the majority), and <br>
	Crowded House's Together Alone also has long instrumental endings to songs <br>
	which in its case were put there purposefully, as part of an effort to give <br>
	the album more of the live energy of the band.<br>

	john a rivers - mr &quot;distressed gentlefolk&quot;<br>
	but remember, pat also took credit for the problems with that album:<br>
	${icon_blank}	&lt;i&gt;<br>
	${icon_blank}	This was a real &quot;band&quot; album by a touring unit which<br>
	${icon_blank}	had become really quite ferocious. In choosing to work with John<br>
	${icon_blank}	A. Rivers again we felt that we were sufficiently noisy and fierce<br>
	${icon_blank}	to cope with any over- tidy production strokes he might pull.<br>
	${icon_blank}	&quot;Clean *that* up, then, ya bastard&quot; was out declared policy in the<br>
	${icon_blank}	group. <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Of course, we under-rated him.  I probably did<br>
	${icon_blank}	too much pre-production on my (new) 4-track at home, and the<br>
	${icon_blank}	whole thing sounds a bit stillborn. <br>
	${icon_blank}	&lt;/i&gt;<br>
	<br>
	i thought it a little strange that pat didnt see the irony<br>
	that the song `The Word I Was Looking For' probably contained<br>
	more words than any other.  and i *still* dont know just what<br>
	that word is.<br>

	&gt; The problem that I have with this album is that it is just SO self indulgent.<br>
	&gt; the tunes are sometimes rather reluctant to end.<br>

	ok.  i admit it.  1/2 the time i skip the long fade-outs too,<br>
	because i am familiar with them and they no longer hold the surprises<br>
	i may find in re-listening to the rest of the tune.<br>

	&gt; Perhaps it's because, for a variety of reasons, &quot;Racheland&quot; in particular<br>
	&gt; really hits home, but the emotion in the songs I believe surpasses anything<br>
	&gt; else in the catalogue.<br>
	<br>
	does that fact that several of us continue to see worth in the music<br>
	mean are we all becoming boring old farts?  `racheland' hits near my heart<br>
	too, as much as `real men' did when i was much younger.<br>
	i can see why his audience may be dwindling.  those fans of 86 are<br>
	growing up and losing contact with current JBC releases. the consumers<br>
	of &quot;indie&quot; music in general have less and less in common with a maturing<br>
	artist and what he has to say.  since pat never made the move to a location<br>
	where he would necessarily have a larger audience (llyod cole &amp; NYC),<br>
	it is probably lucky that he has been able to continue on as long as he has.<br>
	<br>
	so.. is it stupidity or integrity that he has stayed where he is<br>
	and not compromised?  (naw, thats not a loaded question!)<br>

	the back-to-back-to-back-to-back of:<br>

	the fade of angel station -&gt; rosemary davis' world of sound (reprise)<br>
	since this is a &quot;quiet&quot; record, you can hear all the little variations<br>
	in what the drummer is doing; you can hear him miss occasionally.<br>
	the small warbles in vocal pitch in rosemary davis'.<br>
	<br>
	it comes across as a very honest record, without pretense.<br>
	<br>

	&gt; I missed the boat on this whole Black Eg think... sounds like some thing the<br>

	it *could* have been the residents for all we know.<br>
	what would you like to know?  if you have mosaic access, the whole<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Those Later Albums
	<p>
	Syd speaks in defence of those later albums :<br>
	<br>
	OK, I've already mentioned Condition Blue, so what about Love Bus ?<br>
	When I first heard WFTLB I was disappointed with it, but it has grown<br>
	on me considerably with repeated listenings. Yes there ARE some cracking<br>
	good songs, and Pat's lyricism shines through as well as ever :<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I would let the handrail go if I thought anything would break my fall&quot;<br>
	( Whadaya ). The other night I bumped into an ex-girlfriend of mine and<br>
	you could have knocked me down with a Black Eg discography. I know exactly<br>
	what Pat means.<br>
	<br>
	WFTLB IS a good album in its own right. O.K., it doesn't sound like the<br>
	OLD Pat Fish stuff, but don't let that prejudice you. Give it a few more<br>
	listens before the next verbal demolition session.<br>
	<br>
	I have recently introduced a couple of friends  to some JBC albums,<br>
	and when I go round their house they always seem to be playing the<br>
	Jazz Butcher. You may be surprised to learn that they rate Love Bus quite<br>
	highly. They're not old farts either ( well, they're both under 30 anyway ).<br>
	<br>
	I too have heard comments along the lines of &quot;The Jazz Butcher, are they<br>
	still going ?&quot; The irony is that the fans of `86 have grown up and might<br>
	appreciate the later stuff more than some of the new fans if only they had<br>
	access to it. <br>

	This is funny, actually, since I have a few albums produced by this<br>
	bloke and for the most part they're alright and not this sort of shiny,<br>
	forgettable pop nonsense that he seems to turn JBC material into. See,<br>
	for instance, his work with the Brilliant Corners (? not so sure about<br>
	this now I come to think of it).<br>
	<br>
	ccamfiel@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca wonders:<br>
	&gt; live renditions of Girl Go and Burglar Of Love.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;burglar of... walrus of love...&quot; Not different enough, really.  I may<br>
	have listened with my cloth ears on, but the Girl Go live was really<br>
	rather like listening to the studio version amplified through a tea tray<br>
	and without such a good intro. Oh but the single's worth it for<br>
	&quot;Excellent!&quot;. All of this is IMHO.<br>
	<br>
	other miscellany:<br>
	<br>
	I just thought I'd chip in the most common response whenever I start<br>
	burbling about JBC or wear my T-Shirt in public, which is: &quot;The Jazz<br>
	Butcher...? Does he play Jazz?&quot; It's getting beyond a joke.<br>
	<br>
	and I have been rumbled:<br>
	<br>
	&gt; hmmm.  racheland is one of the longest.  and guitar-infested.<br>
	&gt; and lyrically self-absorbed.  all those things you hate, ed.<br>
	&gt; what salvages it for you?  visions of poison dwarves? :-)<br>
	<br>
	Those *were* the hardest times.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway it looks like I'm the only true CB basher at the moment since a<br>
	certain geologist (how apt!) admitted the other day that he can't even<br>
	remember what most of Condition Blue sounds like. Ha! His prejudice<br>
	won't keep him warm tonight.<br>

	<p>
	The reason that I barely remeber how Condition Blue goes, <br>
	Ed, is because it always seems to lose my attention <br>
	somewhere in the middle of the first song. Anyway, to be <br>
	totally fair, I played it again last night.<br>
	<br>
	I still think it's a weak album, for much the same reasons <br>
	as Ed, but I guess if you wanted to tape it, fade out every <br>
	song after about three minutes, leave off &quot;Still and all&quot;, <br>
	replace &quot;Monkeyface&quot; with &quot;The Basement&quot; and leave <br>
	&quot;Racheland&quot; as is (I was surprised to find that this was as <br>
	good as everyone has said it was) - it could be a better <br>
	album. Not great, just better.<br>

	Now I guess I'd better go and buy some asbestos trousers.<br>

	<p>
	hello all.  after 3 weeks of software updates, lightning strikes<br>
	and general chaos, it looks like the jbc-list@PASTURE.ecn.purdue.edu<br>
	is back up.<br>
	<br>
	to get things rolling...<br>
	i received a letter from pat which contained some info on upcoming gigs,<br>
	and a list of &lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_letters}/94Jun24/all_the_gigs.html&quot;&gt;EVERY JBC show ever&lt;/a&gt;.<br>
	i wont send that 700-liner to the list - it can be found on the WWW server<br>
	this gig list has been added to the existing searchable database.<br>
	<br>
	interesting things from it:<br>
	${icon_blank}        first gig: 12Jun1982, The Black Lion, Northampton, UK<br>
	${icon_blank}        max's last stand: 27Nov1986, Club 33, Zurich, Switzerland<br>
	${icon_blank}        year with most shows: 1985 (111)<br>
	<br>
	here is some current (2 weeks old) information:<br>
	<kbd>
<br>
	${icon_blank}   I have passed the time since [4Jun94] ruthlessly instilling an iron<br>
	discipline within the ranks, and things are starting to happen.<br>
	Like - would you believe?  - a live version of &quot;Our Friends The Filth&quot;!<br>
	I have seen Levitation with their new American singer (whom they all<br>
	appear to hate) - very powerful and strong, but rather pointless, in a<br>
	very &quot;modern&quot; ways and Strangelove - quite splendid!<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   Have succeeded in booking Strangelove for the second annual<br>
	&quot;It's Got To Be Belgium&quot; festival here - at a price of... NOTHING!<br>
	Ha!Ha!Ha!  It will be their first gig after the l.p. comes out.<br>
	I love doing this - it annoys the local promoters SO much! The guy came<br>
	last year when we put on Peter Astor and he just stood in the corner<br>
	asking &quot;How?&quot; Excellent!   Also lined up for the fest are Curt's mob,<br>
	&quot;Stranger Tractors&quot;, Spittle Rattle, Transambient Communications and,<br>
	coup of coups!, a band from Vienna called The Black Eg.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   This is all across 8th-10th August in the garden at Belgium.<br>
	The Eg are also playing a rave in London on 22nd July at The Fortress,<br>
	King's Cross, and they have been invited to Ibiza too!  Vibornye!<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   On Friday night Dave and I will be doing an acoustic show in Rugby.<br>
	The next proper JBC show is at La Maison Du Peuple (!) in Clermont-Ferrand,<br>
	France, on 7th July.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   We have achieved a Canadian release (Sony), and so renewed energy has<br>
	been given to the North American campaign.  We're aiming for September,<br>
	so that we can relieve all the students of the dough their loving parents<br>
	have just given them at the start of the semester.  (See? I can speak American.)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  I've begun a little writing; favourite lines at this early stage rhyme<br>
	&quot;civ ilised way&quot; with &quot;drivel I say&quot;... hmmmm...<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Here is the price of free Publicity - a list of every JBC date that I<br>
	can recall.  I think I missed one in June 1985 at a teacher-training college<br>
	in London, the night before we flew to Rome for the Foro Tevere.  Also I've<br>
	neglected to put in all the in-store type things and the legendary Clare's<br>
	Party, Hammersmith in the fall of 1985.  Apart from these errors, which<br>
	I spotted too late for the list, I think you'll find that you have<br>
	The Definitive Word on JBC live action since the year zero.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   God - what it is to have a head full of trivial cak, hey?<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   Hope that all is groovy out west and that you are having as much fun<br>
	with the World Cup as I currently am.<br>
	<kbd>
<br>
	<br>
	trivial cak?  *he's* the one who typed out 12 pages worth of gigs!<br>
	i just scanned them in :-)<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> SHIRTS!
	<p>
	Hello everyone!<br>
	<br>
	I am seriously thinking about having a shirt made based upon the B&amp;W<br>
	promotional shot of the band from Paris that was in the May 20th <br>
	promotional release, which is up on the WWW page/site.  <br>
	<br>
	&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_images}/paris.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;${jbc_images}/sparis.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>
	<br>
	For those of you who haven't seen it but can access WWW, check it out!  For <br>
	those of you who can't access WWW, maybe I can send it to you.  It shows Pat <br>
	and co crowded together wearing some weird shirts that I think they must <br>
	have decorated themselves, since they all look to be the same material<br>
	but with different (and many!) designs.  Funny, silly, and great IMO!<br>
	I'm planning on cutting off the right quarter of the picture (approximately)<br>
	so that Pat's head is near the top centre.<br>
	<br>
	I've called a couple of places, and one seemed pretty good since they work<br>
	with CorelDraw, and so I can bring in the pic on disk without having to<br>
	print it on paper, and then add lettering.  I was thinking of maybe having <br>
	two lines of text, one being &quot;The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy&quot; (what else) at<br>
	the top, and then at the bottom either &quot;Waiting For The Love Bus&quot; or (my<br>
	first thought) &quot;EXCELLENT!&quot;  Consider it my critical response. :)  I don't<br>
	know what font or text size to use yet.  Suggestions about what text to<br>
	use, font, and text size would of course be welcome!<br>
	<br>
	Why am I posting this?  Well, it would seem that I'm not going to be able<br>
	to make just one shirt, and I thought maybe some other people on the list<br>
	would be interested too.  Another band's mailing list I am on has come <br>
	up with a semi-official shirt for the mailing list, but I don't know if <br>
	we care about that.  Ideally at least ten or eleven people will be <br>
	interested in this, since the minimum order is 12.  The shirts<br>
	are going to be pretty cheap - about $7 Canadian all told, and<br>
	the shirts themselves would be good cotton Fruit Of The Loom brand.<br>
	[NB I imagine that sweatshirts might be available too, at greater cost.]<br>
	I don't know what colours the shirts are available in yet either, I<br>
	imagine lots, though I was thinking about going with &quot;classic&quot; white<br>
	since the design would be black (though I guess it could be all red,<br>
	or green, or whatever, but I think black would probably look best).  I<br>
	imagine a mixed order of shirt colours is possible.<br>
	<br>
	I guess I should point out that the shirts will cost about $7 Canadian<br>
	PLUS packaging and postage, which I hope won't be too much.  At the <br>
	current exchange rates, I'd guess that's about $5 U.S. or 4 pounds UK plus<br>
	p &amp; p.  I have enough money that I could make the order before getting <br>
	everyone's money, but if I got stuck with 6 shirts because people changed <br>
	their minds then I wouldn't be happy.<br>
	<br>
	If you are interested, or might be interested if you could see what<br>
	the design looks like when it's all together, or might be interested<br>
	if I had details about shirt colours or anything else, please let me<br>
	know!<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Harlan
	<p>
	I just wanted to mention that I recently started reading Harlan Ellison's<br>
	stories, and got a complete blast (and a bit of a chill) when I recognized<br>
	what the lines in the song about Jeffy are about (&quot;Jeffy is 5... the same<br>
	as he was in 1959...&quot; I think it goes) - one of Harlan's stories is called<br>
	Jeffy, and it's a classic.  Quite spooky.<br>
	<br>
	The other thing that flipped in my mind was what &quot;We're not alone&quot; meant.<br>
	I figured, before reading any of the stories, that it meant there were<br>
	aliens out there or something.  But Ellison writes his stories to disturb,<br>
	and to let the reader know that other people feel the same way about X,<br>
	like being mad that someone died, for example.<br>
	<br>
	Cool song!<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> Chris Camfield &lt;ccamfiel@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> shirt design
	<p>
	Well, I just letterbombed David with a preliminary design for the shirt.  (I<br>
	think a 900k uuencoded file counts as a letterbomb.  I wonder if he got it<br>
	all.)  Hopefully he will be able to put it up on the WWW page.  Please note,<br>
	anyone who sees it, that the graphic is a bit munged by going in and out<br>
	of CorelDraw 3.0 and I will be snipping out the lettering and using a<br>
	better quality copy of the picture.  Best to look at the original picture<br>
	(also on the WWW page) if you want to see it in detail.  Of course, I'm<br>
	not sure exactly how it will turn out on the shirt.<br>
	<br>
	And the costs keep going down and down and down... there are now well over 26<br>
	orders, so we qualify for a cheaper printing cost, and because there are lots<br>
	of orders, the cost/shirt for the design fee is less, and the impact of<br>
	sending 3 shirts to the JBC is also lessened.  Right now we are looking at<br>
	$8.35 for one-sided, or $9.93 for two-sided.  Since the difference is<br>
	small, I think it might be a good idea to put &quot;Excellent!&quot; on the back and <br>
	just have the band name and picture on the front.  So, when you are looking <br>
	at the design, draw an imaginary line below the picture to separate the top <br>
	from the bottom.  If I get disagreement about this, I'll rethink it, but so <br>
	far the reaction to keeping the design from being too &quot;busy&quot; has been small <br>
	but relatively positive.  I'll be finding out about postal rates real soon <br>
	now, and after that I'll start asking for money.<br>
	<br>
	People with no access to the Web who want to see the design:  if you can<br>
	handle getting a 900k uuencoded file in the mail, ask for it.  If not, <br>
	suggest an ftp site where I can put it and I will try my best.  I figure <br>
	anyone who came across the picture and wanted to use it would probably be <br>
	a diehard JBC fan anyways.<br>

	<p>
	Well, I haven't seen the file yet, since I don't have access to WWW<br>
	from this machine (though I will be sure to check it out later), but<br>
	here are some suggestions...<br>
	<br>
	Is it really going to cost any less to put &quot;Excellent&quot; on <br>
	the back than it would to put some sort of picture (yes, I know<br>
	the reference, but something about the word &quot;excellent has made<br>
	me shudder ever since Bill &amp; Ted)? Personally, I would rather have<br>
	a picture if it's about the same...  Perhaps we could even get Pat<br>
	to make up something special for it, since he's now involved and<br>
	he seems to like to do sketches (what do you think, David?).<br>
	The would really make the shirts cool, having some sort of<br>
	exclusive design.<br>
	<br>
	Also, I think putting the lettering from Waiting for the Love Bus<br>
	on it would be OK, and would probably look better than just some<br>
	randomly chosen lettering.  And after all, since the endeavour<br>
	seems to have the JBC's blessing, why not make it look official?<br>
	<br>
	Just my input, since no one else seems to be saying much of<br>
	anything...<br>

	I understand completely.  It's a weird thing, typography, but once<br>
	you've seen how it really is, there's nothgin you can do but speak up.<br>
	<br>
	Jim <br>
	<br>
	uh-huh, and here's my last message to the list, which seems to have<br>
	bounced...<br>
	<br>
	It's about shirts.<br>
	<br>
	(that's just the name of the shop. sir) <br>
	<br>
	CONVERGENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
	<br>
	Shirts: your mother is right.  I wish that I had parents whose advice<br>
	${icon_blank}        upon matters of taste was anything other than something to<br>
	${icon_blank}        avoid... but hey, that's my problem... :*)<br>
	<br>
	Text:   how about `The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy' on the front (not too<br>
	${icon_blank}        large, not too offensive, same font as the album cover,<br>
	${icon_blank}        possibly `J.B.C.' instead if you like) ???<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        and on the back... `Waiting for the Love Bus', arranged <br>
	${icon_blank}        appropriately (same font as album, again... if you go for<br>
	${icon_blank}        anything psychedelic then it could look stupid or brilliant,<br>
	${icon_blank}        difficult to say) <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        whoever made the point about `Excellent!' was quite right... <br>
	${icon_blank}        I hadn't thought of that.... nice one... etc.  let's not and <br>
	${icon_blank}        say we did.<br>
	<br>
	Picture: front only, as suggested.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC LoveBus Font
	<p>
	For those that are interested, my latest (but still far from perfect)<br>
	attempt to emulate the LoveBus coverfont by endlessly fiddling with curves<br>
	in Corel is available from my WWW server.<br>
	<br>
	Either fetch:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        http://otter.dai.ed.ac.uk:3034/jbc.tar<br>
	<br>
	or go through my brand new, under development, heavy-on-the-semiotics<br>
	homepage:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}        http://otter.dai.ed.ac.uk:3034<br>
	<br>
	and click on the very bottom left of the JBC logo there.<br>
	<br>
	Rather worryingly, I've reached the limit of my artistic abilities<br>
	re:typography, but it may just be that Corel is a crap program. Can anyone<br>
	do any better? Does anyone want to? Is there anybody there?<br>
	<br>
	The tar file contains the .GIF and the .CDR (v3) for those with Corel Draw.<br>
	<br>
	I should put the penguin back, I think.<br>

	<p>
	sez jbc-shirt-list coup leader Chris Camfield:<br>
	&gt; Has anyone thought about how Waiting For The Love Bus contains almost NO<br>
	&gt; sampled sounds, and does this mark a change?  Positive or negative?<br>
	<br>
	well, the samples on LoveBus (racecars, passing 'planes, etc) are in<br>
	the same spirit of how samples have always been used, i think.<br>
	<br>
	the JBC use samples very much like how they use lyrics, as<br>
	a piece of the narrative.  since a sample always(?) deal somewhat<br>
	with the topic/story at hand, it is just another way of saying:<br>
	&quot;see, this is what it was like&quot;.  pat once said that the reason<br>
	he used samples (during the Big Planet era) is that he can tell people:<br>
	&quot;see this is *exactly* what it was like, i dont have to describe it for you&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	so is it a change?  it isnt as if they were a pop group that suddenly<br>
	discovered samplers and indiscriminately started dropping funny sounds<br>
	into a song simply because it was hip that year.  it seems to me that<br>
	in the context of LoveBus (laid-back, mostly) it fits.  Big Planet<br>
	had more, but then, Big Planet was released in a more obnoxious time.<br>
	<br>
	can anyone tell me why all the delphi.com and aol.com accounts<br>
	are bouncing all their email?<br>
	<br>
	does anyone have a CD player handy?  how about transcribing some lyrics?<br>
	done so far: filth, penguins, ghosts, president chang,<br>

	I was typing up the lyrics for Peter Lorre earlier and a question floated into<br>

	Is the song supposed to be serious or sarcastic?  I've only seen Peter<br>
	Lorre in _Casablanca_, _The Maltese Falcon_, and _All through the night_.<br>
	In _Falcon_ and _All through..._ he is rather NOT like he's described <br>
	in the song - he's NOT the guy you'd want to trust, like the song says,<br>
	and in _Falcon_ he is scared of Sydney Greenstreet's character.  Is anyone<br>
	on the list a b&amp;w film buff, who can say a bit more about Peter Lorre? I<br>
	presume the song was written because he died not long before?  I don't know.<br>

	G'day guys,<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     &quot;Waiting For The Love Bus&quot; finally arrived in Tasmania last week! (yay<br>
	Neil from Rare Groove)<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Anyway, a drive across the island listening to &quot;Waiting For The Love Bus&quot;<br>
	involved listening to the other side of the cassette as well, which was<br>
	&quot;Western Family&quot;. The version of &quot;Angels&quot; off this CD has a reference I haven't<br>
	picked up on before until just now. In the middle of the song, Pat sings<br>
	<br>
	&quot;In heaven, everything is fine<br>
	${icon_blank} In heaven, everything is fine...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     EXACTLY the same as in &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     Yay! Now I have a link between the JBC and David Lynch as well as a<br>
	link between the JBC and Laurie Anderson<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps in penance, I should do the lyrics from &quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot;<br>

	Now *this* is scary ...<br>
	<br>
	Listening through a couple of old tapes late yesterday evening, I found a<br>
	taped radio broadcast containing a review of `Eraserhead' (which I,<br>
	shame on me, haven't yet seen). They were playing that snippet as a<br>
	backdrop. `Startled' doesn't do my reaction justice.<br>
	<br>
	Two people finding the connection from different sides, on opposite<br>
	corners of the globe, at the same time. <br>
	<br>
	Add the drought over Europe, and wonder: what's next? Locusts? Repent, I<br>
	say, repent: the end is nigh.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Shirt slogan
	<p>
	I'd STRONGLY like to voice an opinion AGAINST anything political on the<br>
	shirt.  <br>
	<br>
	Some reasons:<br>
	<br>
	1) if everyone on the list doesn't share EXACTLY the same beliefs (and show<br>
	me a diverse group that does), then you'll be asking people to buy something<br>
	they don't necessarily see eye to eye on the meaning of; and <br>
	<br>
	2) regardless of my own personal politics, which are, in fact, personal, I<br>
	must admit that even in my collegiate wild-eyed radical [sic} stage, I'd<br>
	always found Pat's occasional political pronouncement a little on the<br>
	sophomoric side. Still rankles a bit, honestly, that a man with such a keen<br>
	and heartfelt perception of issues that we might call PERSONAL politics seems<br>
	rather hamstrung when it comes to political statements of a broader nature. <br>
	<br>
	Again, it's not the side he picks that I choose to argue with--there are<br>
	always arguments for and against both, and I'm prepared to agree to disagree<br>
	with anyone with a well-thought out point of view--but the<br>
	less-than-open-minded way he has on occasion expressed those opinions --EVEN<br>
	IN JEST--that would make me less likely to wear a t-shirt with such a saying<br>
	printed on it. Indeed, in over ten years of listening to and loving his<br>
	music, this is the only truly major complaint I've ever had about him. <br>
	<br>
	Anyway, I've spouted off without presenting a solution, and in closing, I've<br>
	got to say I'm getting more and more fond of &quot;Sometimes it feels like ancient<br>
	Rome&quot;. Cos it does.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you for your time. We now return to our regularly scheduled debate on<br>
	extenders and serifs.<br>

	<p>
	Ok, it looks like we're down to &quot;Waiting for the love bus&quot;.  Nice and safe,<br>
	that.  *grumble*  *grin*  I mean the regular shirts will probably have <br>
	that.  As a last suggestion for improoooovement, how about a list of all <br>
	the albums with their years, instead?  Suitable for us JBC list members, who<br>
	are pretty hard-core fans, neh?<br>
	<br>
	Colour me confused, but the WWW site lists 9 albums, ending with WftLB.  But<br>
	for some reason I remember reading WftLB being referred to as Pat's 10th<br>
	album.  Does Western Family count?  Or Hamburg?  I'd almost consider Spooky<br>
	as another choice for &quot;10th album&quot;, even though, as Pat says in the liner, it<br>
	isn't.  &quot;We'll be spending the money on weapons and drugs.&quot;  Hehehe.<br>
	<br>
	I bought myself the Girl-Go CD single today (I think it was hiding last time<br>
	I looked, and not bought by someone else!).  I have to say that I felt<br>
	the rumours of horrid sound quality (of the live tracks) that I read here <br>
	are unfounded!  I've heard *FAR* worse.  I was rather blown away by the<br>
	live version of Burglar of Love.  Pity I won't get to see a rocking JBC now...<br>

	John, i understand your concerns - i wouldn't want anything stupid<br>
	or personally offensive to end up on my sleeve, either.<br>
	could you help by giving some citations?<br>
	<br>
	i will start by clarifying some things as i understand them..<br>
	off the top of my head, these tunes may be interpretted as being political:<br>
	${icon_blank}        Jazz Butcher -v- Prime Minister<br>
	${icon_blank}                it is taking a piss.  implies that criminals could<br>
	${icon_blank}                run the government.  same era as Death Dentist and other<br>
	${icon_blank}                sing-along tunes.<br>
	${icon_blank}        Next Move Sideways<br>
	${icon_blank}                he is bewildered with the changes due to governmental policies<br>
	${icon_blank}                occuring around him and he is powerless to change them.<br>
	${icon_blank}                no recommendation as to retribution, just observation.<br>
	${icon_blank}        Hysteria<br>
	${icon_blank}                he has a distaste for aspects of life on the West Coast.<br>
	${icon_blank}                i interviwed pat in 1989, and remember confronting him with the<br>
	${icon_blank}                visciousness of this song.  he argued that, yes, there are<br>
	${icon_blank}                bad things there, so he will tell them (book burnings, etc),<br>
	${icon_blank}                but he also tells the good (&quot;what for did we come here? i guess<br>
	${icon_blank}                we came here to learn&quot;).  although Hysteria may be a place,<br>
	${icon_blank}                it may also be his reaction: admittedly hysterical.<br>
	${icon_blank}        New Invention<br>
	${icon_blank}                thatcherite politics as a &quot;bad cover version&quot; of reganite<br>
	${icon_blank}                politics.  why import Axl Rose?<br>
	${icon_blank}        Line Of Death<br>
	${icon_blank}                this song came out BEFORE the gulf war, though just by months.<br>
	${icon_blank}        Filth<br>
	${icon_blank}                same vein.  it is obvious there is loathing for the military.<br>
	${icon_blank}                let's make generalizations about the dupe in the submarine.<br>
	${icon_blank}        Kids In The Mall<br>
	${icon_blank}                well, it reads line newspaper reports of changes to<br>
	${icon_blank}                capitalism in the old red state.  is it a good thing?<br>
	<br>
	perhaps you can count Bubonic Plague and Daycare Nation as being somewhat<br>
	political, as they fall into the standard JBC &quot;report aspects of what<br>
	we see&quot;.  he's a vegetarian, and it slips out in tunes, too.<br>
	<br>
	i would fault the guy if he were to write obvious statements<br>
	(vote Demo/Commie!).  but it appears to me that he is just &quot;reporting&quot;<br>
	(filtered, sure) life around him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;why vote for the lesser evil&quot; (and &quot;no more years&quot;) are actually taken<br>
	from a joke/radical Californian political party flyer from the previous<br>
	US election.  i was led to believe that it was not his own view, and he<br>
	wondered how these people would react when they found their beloved slogan<br>
	had been lifted.<br>
	<br>
	i think it would be good to hear pat's defense of these charges,<br>
	as others here have had issue with ambiguous lyrics (Re: President Chang).<br>

	Less-than-random musings:<br>

	See what I mean about diversity? :)))<br>
	<br>
	David, I was in particular thinking of an interview I read in the<br>
	mid-eighties --a long time ago, to be sure--in which he referred rather<br>
	even-handedly to the U.S. as 'the most evil regime the world has ever<br>
	created' (close to his exact words, though not quite....and I must say that<br>
	takes a lot of pressure off Pol Pot), while extolling the virtues of the<br>
	Soviet system (presumably under Gorbachev, where, to be sure, lots of<br>
	exciting things were happening, but so was some business as usual). <br>
	<br>
	I may still have that interview somewhere (talk about anally retentive); if I<br>
	do, I'd be happy to post the whole thing. That's what I meant by<br>
	sophomoric.....the sort of thing that, coming from a fellow as intelligent<br>
	and perceptive as Pat obviously is, would make one rather stick with the<br>
	penguins (which, in its own way, could be taken as an extremely astute<br>
	INTERPERSONAL political statement, and one which I find deeply moving). <br>
	<br>
	To be sure, in his songs, the SATIRIC aspect of his views is much more clear<br>
	(and show me a government that COULDN'T have holes poked in it), but if that<br>
	slogan comes from where I think it might--and please tell me where--it could<br>
	be even WORSE, rather than better. Rant rave blither blah blah blah.<br>
	<br>
	Ultimately, I guess my point is that as much as I love the guy's work, I'd<br>
	hate to end up as a walking advertisement for the one side I'm less proud of.<br>
	<br>
	Peace, love, and simple chord progressions,<br>

	This is mainly a test to see if my jbc mail will stop bouncing; but also, <br>
	on the shirt idea, my vote goes for simple: a white shirt with black <br>
	printing... the aforementioned picture that Chris has with &quot;Jazz Butcher <br>
	Conspiracy&quot; on the front and &quot;Waiting for the Love Bus&quot; below or on the <br>

	<br><b>From:</b> de l`abattoir &lt;del&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Gig Report from Matt Cockerill
	<p>
	Not sure if it was announced on the list, but Pat and friends played in<br>
	Northampton again on Wednesday night, inaugurating the series of gigs  to<br>
	be known as &quot;Fridge 2&quot; (Black Eg and various others upcoming).<br>
	<br>
	The gig was outdoors, in what you might call the beergarden, though it's<br>
	more like a bit of derelict ground they happenm to have access to. The band<br>
	played under a big tarpaulin, and surrounded by drapes (possibly done by<br>
	Pascal Legras) on which were projected all kind of groovy swirly patterns -<br>
	it was really quite cool, rather like an early Pink Floyd concert.<br>
	<br>
	Playing were Pat and Dooj, of course, and Gabriel on drums, and a guitarist<br>
	and saxophonist who I apologize for not knowing the names of.<br>
	<br>
	Whoever was lamenting that they would never see a really rocking JBC lineup<br>
	is in for a nice surprise. This was lively stuff, and it went down really<br>
	well with cognoscenti and newbies alike.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Set list included:<br>
	We're going to have a really good time together (VU cover)<br>
	Mr Odd  (Funny, that...)<br>
	She's On Drugs<br>
	Our Friends The Filth<br>
	Skinheads<br>
	Rosemary Davis<br>
	Ghosts<br>
	Soul Happy Hour<br>
	and Sister Death (once again described as the &quot;packed lunch&quot; version)<br>
	<br>
	It's just to be hoped that the threatened 20000 fine on Slurps for noise<br>
	pollution never materialises, and that the weather and the scaffolding hold<br>
	for the rest of August. (An adjoining building was demolished recently,<br>
	taking some rather important structural parts of Slurps with it, hence the<br>
	scaffolding).<br>
	<br>
	Next London gig confirmed to be at the Borderline on Wednesday 17th.<br>
	Also discussed with Pat the existence of a group in America called, if I<br>
	remember correctly &quot;Mothers against Jaegermeister&quot;, and the ongoing life<br>
	hassles of David J and Love and Rockets. He was mentioning something about<br>
	the real hi tech methods that went into the recording of Bela Lugosi's<br>
	dead, with David J crouching on the floor recording the sound of water<br>
	<br>
	Matt<br>
	<br>
	P.S. did anybody get my message  (it seemed to bounce around a lot) saying<br>
	that you can read stuff and get pictures from one of Pat's favourite books<br>
	(Roadside America, with Tiny the Gator etc) online, from www.wired.com.<br>
	(http://www.wired.com/Hotwired/roadside/index.html)<br>

	the USSR, albeit in the standard lighthearted novelty song format.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	IMHO he does have an astute summation of the UK political scene...<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> T-shirts!  Get yer t-shirts heeeeeere
	<p>
	Hey all,<br>
	<br>
	Well, there's still no final quote for the back, but I hope to have made<br>
	a final decision by the end of next week at the latest.  (I'd hoped for<br>
	this week, but the mailing list I think went down!??  Anyhow, I haven't<br>
	been getting any responses lately.)<br>
	<br>
	So, I think it is time that I asked for money from people!  I am freezing<br>
	the costs at the 40-shirt rate, which makes the price, conveniently, $10.50<br>
	Canadian per shirt, plus postage.  The postage is going to be higher, because<br>
	as I suspected might be the case, each shirt weighs over 250g so everything<br>
	got shifted over a price category (for postage).  When I have received<br>
	enough cheques (even if they haven't cleared) I will make the order.  Once<br>
	your cheque has cleared (and if the shirts are done) I'll send you your<br>
	shirts.<br>
	<br>
	Anyhow, here are the costs in Canadian funds:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}          US ground   US air   UK air<br>
	1 shirt   14.20       15.53    18.30<br>
	2 shirts  27.00       29.30    36.65<br>
	<br>
	And in your local currency:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}          US ground   US air   UK air<br>
	1         10.25       11.21     8.58<br>
	2         19.48       21.14    17.17<br>
	<br>
	You can either send me a postal money order or international bank cheque in<br>
	Canadian funds, or a cheque in your own currency.  Or cash, but there are<br>
	no guarantees that your money will arrive safely.  Please address your<br>
	cheques to Christopher Camfield at:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}    21 Roslin Ave. S<br>
	${icon_blank}    Waterloo, Ontario<br>
	${icon_blank}    CANADA<br>
	${icon_blank}    N2L 2G6<br>
	<br>
	Don't forget to put enough stamps on your envelope!  People in the US,<br>
	I believe it isn't quite as expensive as overseas.  If you want to wait<br>
	until a final back is decided, that's okay.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Strangelove, The Black Watch
	<p>
	A couple of non-JB notes, but clearly related:<br>
	<br>
	In the 'thank you's on The Black Watch's latest, _Amphetamines_, they thank<br>
	Butchie. Anyone know the connection? Did they open for him on his last trip<br>
	to the West Coast, where they're from? Oh, and the album is excellent, strongly<br>
	recommended.<br>
	<br>
	I'm surprised there hasn't been more talk about Strangelove. After leaving <br>
	the Blue Aeroplanes (whose new album, _Life Model_, is good but misses his<br>
	touch), Alex Lee formed Strangelove. The lead singer's vocals remind me of<br>
	that common goth sound, i.e. the Damned, Lowlife, The Cult, etc. But with<br>
	Alex's guitar behind him, the album is KILLER. It rocks much harder than the<br>
	typical goth sound, and his lyrics aren't quite the usual gloom-and-doom. I<br>
	haven't seen ANYTHING from these guys here in Boston, so when I went to <br>
	England, I managed to pick up:<br>
	_Love Hysteria_ CDEP, 4 tracks, 1992.<br>
	_Time For The Rest Of Your Life_, CDEP, 3 tracks, 1994.<br>
	_Time For The Rest Of Your Life_, CD, 13 tracks, 1994.<br>
	<br>
	I was lucky in that the full album JUST came out while I was over there.<br>
	So does anyone else have comments on this stuff? Know about any US tour<br>
	dates for Strangelove or the Blue Aeroplanes?<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC query (fwd)
	<p>
	Very interesting someone asked this today (see below). <br>
	Sister Death is one of my <br>
	favorite JBC songs and I was thinking about its inspiration just yesterday.<br>
	I picked up a copy of Anne Rice's, 'Interview with the Vampire', this <br>
	week-end and was surprised to see that the 'main' vampire, Lestat, refers <br>
	to a young vampire girl in the book as (among other names), you guessed it,<br>
	Sister Death.  Furthermore, this young girl is usually held in the arms <br>
	of the protagonist whenever they walk around town and she rarely talks <br>
	when she's around Lestat (whom she hates).  This reminded me of &quot;hold you <br>
	in my arms&quot; and &quot;there's no need to talk anymore&quot; from the song.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Finally, the line &quot;come Sister Death, get me out of here&quot; is also <br>
	familiar from the book as the protagonist also dislikes Lestat and wants <br>
	to get away from him but fears he can't leave him. But the young vampiress<br>
	tries to assure him that with her help, they can leave together.<br>
	${icon_blank}	What do other's think, am I crazy or what!  As to Gaiman's Death, <br>
	I don't know anything about it. <br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Anne Rice/&quot;Sister Death&quot;
	<p>
	Glen makes a good argument for Sister Death being inspired by<br>
	Anne Rice.  I confess it has been a few years since I read &quot;Interview<br>
	With a Vampire&quot;.  My case for Sister Death deriving from the Sandman<br>
	comic is somewhat circumstantial.  First, Death is Dream's sister, ergo<br>
	Sister Death.  Second, Death's role in Gaiman's cosmology is to escort<br>
	dying souls to their post-corporeal destinations--thus accounting for<br>
	the line &quot;Sister Death get me out of here&quot;--However, I'm inclined to agree <br>
	with Glen D.  Of course, it's possible that the J. Butcher was inspired by<br>
	his own muse, Neil Gaiman, Anne Rice or any combination of the three.<br>
	<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Looking For Lot 49
	<p>
	I just wanted to mention, on the subject of Lot 49...<br>
	<br>
	I actually read the book earlier this summer, because of the song.  (I <br>
	thought &quot;what the hey, why not&quot; when it was on the recommended reading shelf <br>
	at my local library.)  As far as I can remember, the only bit of the song <br>
	that refers to the book is the bit about the man on the corner...  I think <br>
	that it goes something like:<br>
	<br>
	There's a man on the corner with egg in his hair<br>
	(Something) and I don't like his stare<br>
	But he's only a postman so what do I care<br>
	<br>
	The book deals for the most part with some weird 19th-century postal company <br>
	and secrets concerning it... so the postman is the only tie-in.<br>
	<br>
	If I was to do a book review, I would definitely use the word &quot;strange&quot; a <br>
	lot.  It's a weird book.<br>

	<p>
	I went to the shirt company today; nothing yet, apparently because of a <br>
	delay in getting the shirts, as there is apparently a shortage of white L <br>
	shirts every year.  Anyhow, anyone who has asked for a change in shirt <br>
	colour will hopefully have gotten it, but if it doesn't work out, hopefully <br>
	white will be okay. :)<br>
	<br>
	Final, final, FINAL word on shirt backs:  After more hemming and hawing <br>
	recently, the shirt back is going to be &quot;Electrical sounds&quot;.  I should have <br>
	a copy of the artwork on Friday, hopefully.  Then the shirts should be ready <br>
	Monday or Tuesday, and I will get them out to those people whose cheques I <br>
	have received next week.  Everyone else will get theirs sent off in the <br>
	second week of September.<br>
	<br>
	I watched an old b&amp;w comedy called &quot;Beat the devil&quot; last night, with good <br>
	ol' Bogart and a rather aged-looking Peter Lorre.  Besides good old Peter, <br>
	whose character was as undependable as ever, there was also a character who <br>
	fit the English-speaking gentleman of &quot;Holiday&quot; very well - I thought of the <br>
	song as I was watching the film.  I recommend &quot;Beat the devil&quot;, if you can <br>
	find it.<br>

	<p>
	Hello everyone of the JBC list!  I recently joined the list, after Dave sent me <br>
	a nice e-mail when he saw a post I had sent to alt.music.alternative concerning <br>
	older Jazz Butcher recordings.  Nice to see a group devoted to JBC.<br>
	<br>
	I first &quot;discovered&quot; JBC when I lived in Atlanta 1987-1990.  WRAS Album 88 <br>
	(Georgia State University's radio station) played several of their tracks.  The <br>
	first to catch my attention was Nightmare Being from Big Planet Scarey Planet.  <br>
	I instantly knew I had found a band that spoke to me.  That was the first CD of <br>
	their's that I bought, and have bought every one I could find since then.  Also <br>
	got lucky and found a copy of Fishcotheque in a used record store here in <br>
	Rochester, MN.  Had a chance to see the Butcher about two years ago up in <br>
	Minneapolis during the Condition Blue tour.  He played a great song list, but <br>
	the sound quality that night was horrible!!!  The crowd became very restless and<br>
	thinned out about an hour into the show.  Too bad.  I would love to see them <br>
	again.  I will be moving to Chicago next spring, so hopefully my chances will <br>
	improve.<br>
	<br>
	Any information about a US tour?  Anytime soon?  How about a new release?  I <br>
	finally found a copy of Waiting for the Love Bus (when I was in Chicago two <br>
	months ago, imagine that!) and can't wait for the next album by JBC.<br>

	&gt; I have as of yet been able only to find one Max Eider<br>
	&gt; album entitled &quot;The best kisser in the world&quot; on Big<br>
	&gt; Time (I think) records released in the U.S. Are there any more?<br>
	<br>
	best kisser is max's only album, although you already are<br>
	aware that he hangs out with david j these days.<br>
	<br>
	i had the pleasure just before x-mas of witnessing pat<br>
	mimicing the eider bits from hoagy charmichael when they<br>
	played a duo set in northampton (pat's hometown).<br>
	he almost pulled it off (david ducks..)<br>
	<br>
	&gt; I have recently moved out to Oregon and have yet to find<br>
	&gt; anyone who has even heard of The Butcher or any related type things.<br>
	<br>
	the JBC have a decent following in the mighty northwest,<br>
	and they always play portland, seattle, and vancouver.<br>
	you are not alone, as they say.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; &quot;Jazz Butcher versus Max Eider&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	thats a fun one - it has peter lorre and the conspiracy anthem.<br>
	<br>
	for those of you who have joined in the last week...<br>
	<br>
	there is a t-shirt being made - contact ChrisC@watcom.on.ca - soon!<br>
	<br>
	also, here is the &quot;latest&quot; from fish:<br>
	<br>
	&gt; liddy@rci.ripco.com (Joe Beaulieu)<br>
	&gt; Just spoke with Pat.<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; He's not coming over here in September due to some trouble with<br>
	&gt; the Canadians. Says he's ready to go off and record another<br>
	&gt; album right now since he has already toured Europe twice off<br>
	&gt; of Love Bus.<br>
	&gt;<br>
	&gt; There is no new Black Eg release.<br>
	&gt; Fire is the label that is supposed to re-release the Glass stuff.<br>
	<br>
	so, it sounds as if the &quot;difficult 10th&quot; album is underway.<br>
	lord only knows what it will be.  i would love to see him<br>
	confuse the press with a full-length techno album - but only<br>
	if he ditches that yamaha drum machine.<br>

	Sorry about the general posting of this; but people might be interested.<br>
	Hi there fellow Oregonians and JBC fans.  You are not alone and the JBC <br>
	does have a following and even gets airplay in Oregon.  There are 2 <br>
	people on this list just up the road from you at OSU.  In Eugene, 91.9 <br>
	KVRM plays JBC at least once a week.  I've recently heard &quot;Kids in the Mall&quot;,<br>
	&quot;The Devil is My Friend&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot; and I think &quot;Bakersfield&quot; on that <br>
	rather good station.  Sundays from 3-5 pm, a guy named Ken Fusion works <br>
	and will always play JBC if asked to.<br>
	<br>
	You're not isolated just get used to it.<br>

	<p>
	i was listening to my dave kusworth lp last night and there's one<br>
	song on it &quot;the last drop of wine&quot; which has The Jazz Butcher playing<br>
	the flute. Not brilliantly, but well enough. He pops up on sax as well<br>
	a bit later. Crap album otherwise.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway: the question is: Is there no end to this man's talents? Does he<br>
	play flute on any of his own material? What other bizarre instruments <br>
	(well, bizarre as in not guitar, bass, drum) does he play?<br>
	<br>
	In tone deaf awe of renaissance man butcher.<br>
	<br>
	ed<br>
	<br>
	And while we're on the subject (which we're not), the latest Times<br>
	album which is being played to death by me at the moment has a song<br>
	written &amp; sung by butch-cohort mulreany. some have said that paul<br>
	mulreany is a bit of a dark horse with oodles of talent but no<br>
	ambition to realise it. well, on the basis of this song I'd have to<br>
	disagree. but that's only IMHO, obviously. Worth mentioning as the<br>
	first instance I have seen of a Mulreany song being recorded&amp;released.<br>

	my copy of this dave kusworth album &quot;all the heartbreak stories&quot;<br>
	is on CD, but i wonder why?  it is obviously mastered<br>
	from LP - scratches and all.  1991, creation CDECD108.<br>
	i really try to like kusworth, but his single-subject moaning<br>
	is difficult to take in larger-than-small doses.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; What other bizarre instruments does he [pat] play?<br>
	<br>
	xylophone (lots), rubber killer whales (domestic animal).<br>
	he does ok with impromptu keyboard performance, too.<br>

	i have always liked paul's voice and he is so rock-steady<br>
	that you would swear its a drum machine.  i have been unable<br>
	to determine his age, however.  it seems he has been playing<br>
	around for over a decade, but he always appears to be about 23.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Uncovering The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy
	<p>
	Greetings All!<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}     I was asked to introduce myself.  (STANDS)  &quot;My name is David Paterson<br>
	and I am a JBCoholic!&quot; &lt;G&gt;  Actually I am a researcher in the Toxicology<br>
	Dept. at Parke-Davis in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br>
	${icon_blank}     I accidently discovered the JBC one day when a friend made a compilation<br>
	tape of various alternative &quot;stuff&quot;.  We often trade such tapes to discover<br>
	new bands.  This is much cheaper than just buying everything you can get<br>
	your hands on and it lets you sort of preview music to hear what you like.<br>
	${icon_blank} Anyway there was a little song on the tape by The Jazz Butcher and I rushed<br>
	out to the local record store and they said, &quot;The Jazz section is over there!&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank} &quot;No not the Jazz section!  The Jazz Butcher!!!!&quot;  &quot;Huhh!!!!!!!&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank} So I drove a little farther to the &quot;alternative&quot; music store and lo and<br>
	behold there was Cult of the Basement!  Anyhow my quest has been long and<br>
	tedious but at last I have found this list!  I was asking for a JBC<br>
	Discography on rec.music.cd and was referred here by David Whittemore.<br>
	${icon_blank} &quot;Thanks David!&quot; (SLAPS DAVID ON THE BACK)  So far I have on cd<br>
	&quot;Cult of the Basement&quot;, &quot;Waiting for the Love Bus&quot;, &quot;Condition Blue&quot;,<br>
	and &quot;Western Family&quot;.  On vinyl I have &quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot;.<br>
	${icon_blank} What else is still in print?<br>
	${icon_blank}     I was told that several of JBC's earlier albums will soon be reprinted,<br>
	but I heard it was to be the earlier Glass recordings and that Pat was not<br>
	going to receive any royalties for this.  Fire records was to be the label.<br>
	${icon_blank} Is this true?<br>
	${icon_blank}    Well I'm glad to be here!  Perhaps now I will have some help in tracking<br>
	down more <br>
	JBC music!<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> Chris Camfield &lt;ccamfiel@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> songwriter output, albums, and the JBC
	<p>
	A long subject line, I know. But some thoughts have been running through<br>
	my head lately regarding this.<br>
	<br>
	We probably all know that the media (and us, in discussion) have referred<br>
	to the unreliable quality of the Pat's albums.  (I guess that the usual<br>
	opinion is Fishcoteque-BPSP-Cult-Condition-Waiting as good-bad-good-bad-good.<br>
	Or is it?)<br>
	<br>
	It strikes me that compared with a lot of people his age (well, I suppose it <br>
	varies), Pat writes an awful lot of songs.  To compare with arch-nemesis <br>
	Sting *grin* (joking) who I don't think is much older, Sting has put out 4 <br>
	albums since 1985 and Pat has written put out 6, I think.  Plus every couple <br>
	of albums, there seems to be a compilation released.<br>
	<br>
	Now, my question is, does anyone think Pat might do better to release albums<br>
	less frequently, so as to put an overall higher quality of songs on each album?<br>
	(Or is the average song quality just fine? :)  It seems to me that other <br>
	musicians might consign more songs to the B-side category and release fewer<br>
	albums.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, it wouldn't be a problem if the compilations got a lot of press,<br>
	but they don't.  It's a bit unfair that the media doesn't or can't take into <br>
	account the fact that Pat writes so many songs. :)<br>
	<br>
	Chris<br>
	<br>
	PS what is this &quot;Vodka girls&quot; (1994) referred to on the WWW page?  A song <br>
	released for some magazine?  (I forget the reference, though I was just <br>
	looking at it...)<br>

	<p>
	&gt; what is this &quot;Vodka girls&quot; (1994) referred to on the WWW page?<br>
	<br>
	that is off of a French magazine comp (Abus Dangereux),<br>
	and was spotted by Mr Sydney Meats when he was on the list.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Sting has put out 4 albums since 1985 and Pat has written put out 6<br>
	<br>
	mind you, Sting is up there with REM in the popularity department;<br>
	he has fans willing to wait a generation between releases.  it is<br>
	also a *necessity* that he do so - musn't annoy our fan base with<br>
	&quot;trivial cak&quot; - an album must live up to the legacy.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; anyone think Pat might do better to release albums less frequently<br>
	<br>
	&quot;market analysis!  get the boys right on it!<br>
	what?  we don't have an (market) analysis department?<br>
	fuck it, i'll just make my music instead.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	(mostly) unhindered by pop-star baggage, i doubt that he *cares*<br>
	much about that aspect of it.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Pat writes an awful lot of songs.<br>
	<br>
	`D' is an infinitely interesting chord.<br>
	<br>
	mildly related..<br>
	last week, Stereolab played chicago.  since martin stebbing<br>
	and `Lab main man tim gane go way back, i was fortunate enough<br>
	to hang out.  i was wearing my nice new JBC t-shirt, which tim<br>
	was obviously uncomfortable with.  when i asked him about it,<br>
	he admitted to really not liking the JBC.  i let it pass.<br>
	*then* they played... one song has an andlessly repeating<br>
	organ line directly from southern mark smith.  hehehe.<br>

	&gt; We probably all know that the media (and us, in discussion) have referred<br>
	&gt; to the unreliable quality of the Pat's albums.  (I guess that the usual<br>
	&gt; opinion is Fishcoteque-BPSP-Cult-Condition-Waiting as good-bad-good-bad-good.<br>
	&gt; Or is it?)<br>
	<br>
	Is it?  Geez, this opinion is almost completely contrary to mine!  I feel that <br>
	Fishcotheque and Big Planet Scarey Planet are *excellent* albums, Cult of the <br>
	Basement and Condition Blue are good albums, and I'm not too impressed with <br>
	Waiting for the Love Bus (sorry, Dave, but &quot;overprocessed&quot; is an apt <br>
	description, IMHO!).  Just goes to show, we are all different, even though we <br>
	share a passion for a particular coffee (oops, I mean song writer).<br>
	<br>
	BTW, I recently received tapes of Pat's earlier albums (thanks Eric Larson, if <br>
	you are still out there!!), and I feel that Pat has certainly evolved since his <br>
	earlier ventures.  If I had purchased Bath of Bacon or Bloody Nonsense before I <br>
	had ever heard any of his other albums, I probably would have passed on said <br>
	other albums.  However, I really enjoyed Distressed Gentlefolk...similar in tone<br>
	to Fishcotheque, which is my favorite album of the JBC.<br>

	Chris asks<br>
	-} Now, my question is, does anyone think Pat might do better to release albums<br>
	-} less frequently, so as to put an overall higher quality of songs on each album?<br>
	-} (Or is the average song quality just fine? :)  It seems to me that other <br>
	-} musicians might consign more songs to the B-side category and release fewer<br>
	-} albums.<br>
	<br>
	Many artists like to just concentrate on having fun, maybe just fling it all out<br>
	there and see what sticks (so 2 speak), at least until they receive a certain <br>
	level of notoriety/acceptance.  Personally I'm all for being given the opportunity<br>
	to hear &quot;everything&quot; and then I can always decide what I do and don't want to<br>
	listen to.  Besides, if he cut back on releases, we would be on here complaining<br>
	about too little material, no?  :)<br>

	<p>
	Let me revise what I said about differences in album quality - I myself<br>
	think that Fish and BPSP are great albums[1].  BPSP *does* I think have an<br>
	overproduction problem, and in fact just off the top of my head, I think<br>
	that this is more of a problem with the angry songs of BPSP than it is<br>
	with the more laid back WftlB.  That's my reason for assuming that BPSP<br>
	might be considered not as good.  (I think in Pat's comments about the<br>
	albums, he says something about it not being one he reaches for.)<br>
	<br>
	Chris<br>
	<br>
	[1]:  I think all of Pat's stuff is great, including the early stuff because<br>
	(to quote Alexei Sayle) &quot;I like a laugh!&quot;  What I put on the stereo to<br>
	listen to is another question.  For me, Condition Blue is probably the one<br>
	that gets the least playing time, actually...<br>

	<p>
	Oh well, in the name of don't-just-sit-there-SAY-something, here goes.....<br>
	<br>
	The question of quantity VERSUS quality is an interesting one, but<br>
	subjective. Suppose Pat only put out half as many albums as he actually has.<br>
	What if he has a different idea about what the best songs are? Hate to<br>
	mention this, and I'm tossing this out as a generality, and NOT in Pat's<br>
	case, cos I don't have a clue, but an artist isn't always the best judge of<br>
	his own material. <br>
	<br>
	I'd like to cast a vote in favor of Condition Blue in the debate, also.<br>
	Different, to be sure, and admittedly not every song works perfectly (though<br>
	I can't think of an album where every song does). If one does that, though,<br>
	the whole good-bad-good-bad-good etc rhythm gets screwed up royally, though I<br>
	should admit here that I've never cared for Distressed Gentlefolk, which<br>
	might (or might not) redress the balance, but I'm beginning to get confused<br>
	and maybe I should just lie down for a while. <br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> news
	<p>
	a gentleman on the other end of the phone passed on the following info:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	no US/Canadia tour in 94, due to Sony-CA hassles<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	the next/last album as the JBC is to be put onto tape<br>
	${icon_blank}		next month, released in january.  title unclear at this<br>
	${icon_blank}		moment, (&quot;Cort eating sheep&quot;, maybe), as pat is still<br>
	${icon_blank}		finding the &quot;mood&quot;.  song titles at this point:<br>
	${icon_blank}		&quot;Old Snakey&quot; - about a guy in an insane asylum who keeps<br>
	${icon_blank}			an old egyptian statuette which causes 4000<br>
	${icon_blank}			year-old people to come and beat him up.<br>
	${icon_blank}		&quot;Fight For A Normal Life&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}		&quot;When Eno Sings&quot; - in the James sing-along stadium-rock vein.<br>
	${icon_blank}		&quot;Nico In The Bar&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}		working lyric ideas: &quot;life's too short, but so are you&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	&quot;last album&quot;: the JBC moniker has been a &quot;millstone around<br>
	${icon_blank}		my neck for at least the last 3 years&quot;.  &quot;we want to pull<br>
	${icon_blank}		out all the stops, moreso than on Cult&quot;.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	the secret weapon for this album will be one David J manning<br>
	${icon_blank}		the knobs during the mix - it is only natural, and pat<br>
	${icon_blank}		figures it will be worth a few sales on that fact alone.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	his passport expires tomorrow, he was sealing it up in the<br>
	${icon_blank}		re-application envelope when i called. he was lamenting<br>
	${icon_blank}		having to say good-bye to the DDR visas, and the general<br>
	${icon_blank}		fact that his passport had been through it ALL.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	good news on future tours... &quot;big bazzer&quot;, the guy who did<br>
	${icon_blank}		the Blue Aeroplane's sound during the 90 US tour is starting<br>
	${icon_blank}		up his own tour-running thing, and the JBC are on board.<br>
	${icon_blank}		also under baz's wing are The Cramps.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	i had to re-assure him that Chris Camfield was NOT making<br>
	${icon_blank}		massive quantities of money off of the t-shirt thing.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	news to make edwardc happy: the Black Eg have &quot;fucked off&quot;,<br>
	${icon_blank}		and it is rumored that an outfit called the White Eggs have<br>
	${icon_blank}		begun a retaliation campaign.  the fortress rave-gig did not<br>
	${icon_blank}		happen, as the soundpeople had no way to plug the Eg in.<br>
	${icon_blank}		the Black Eg left, disgusted, and declared England full of pigs.<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	sales in Japan are &quot;rising, son&quot;<br>
	${icon_blank}	o	on Haiti - &quot;they check in, but they don't check out - you would<br>
	${icon_blank}		think at least someone in the White House would have heard<br>
	${icon_blank}		that by now!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	gigs upcoming:<br>
	${icon_blank}	12Oct94	- Its Got To Be Belgium (Slurp's Wino Bar), Northampton<br>
	${icon_blank}	21Dec94	- Its Got To Be Belgium (Slurp's Wino Bar), Northampton<br>
	<br>
	AND - waiting in the post when i got to work: another 10-pager to be typed-up<br>
	and passed onto the jbc-list.  includes gig reviews, details on the above,<br>
	and some more &quot;talk-back&quot; to previous jbc-list posts.  these should start<br>
	going out this evening and be available on the WWW server thereafter.<br>

	&gt; DAVID LYNCH AND ANGELS<br>
	${icon_blank} <br>
	${icon_blank} (snip) <br>
	<br>
	&gt; The &quot;Heaven&quot; bit on Angels is, of course, a total steal from Eraserhead. It<br>
	&gt; was Dooj's idea, and it fitted perfectly with the mood of the time. There it<br>
	&gt; is. <br>
	&gt; <br>
	&gt; See also the Twin Peaks reference in Honey on Condition Mogadon. By<br>
	&gt; the way, George, David Lynch and Laurie Anderson use the same<br>
	<br>
	Following this JBC/David Lynch thread, I was wondering about a sample I can hear<br>
	in Burglar of Love on Big Planet Scarey Planet.  Several times in the song, you <br>
	can hear a man saying &quot;He's a very sick and dangerous man&quot;.  This sounds to me <br>
	exactly like Kyle MacLaughlin in Blue Velvet, in the scene where he is telling <br>
	Laura Durn's dad (the cop) about Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).  Am I correct, or <br>
	only hallucinating?<br>

	&gt; 		the Black Eg left, disgusted, and declared England full of pigs<br>
	<br>
	Contrary to this statement, I am not at all happy that the Black Eg<br>
	have fucked off. I *enjoyed* their third album, I *liked* the first<br>

	the fact that they didn't play The Good The Bad and The Ugly (but even<br>
	then I wasn't the one sitting in the bar beforehand devising maniacal<br>
	retributions if they didn't play that one). And that photo of them en<br>

	Actually I suspect this is a really BAD one but it's funny. :)<br>

	If the next album is going to be the last released under the JBC name,<br>
	what will Pat call his band after that?  We could come up with ideas <br>

	Pat Fish and the Fish Heads<br>

	Also, David, please pass on thanks to Pat for a well thought-out response to<br>
	an issue I hoped wouldn't be too emotional (and which I'd hoped I hadn't<br>
	helped to MAKE too emotional). I hadn't really thought about the interviewer<br>
	bias issue, either, and a mid-sized mea culpa for that; in my own profession,<br>
	I get interviewed from time to time myself (ahem), and I understand only too<br>
	well the fact that the biases on the part of the person asking the questions<br>
	can often come out in print appearing more important than the answers, and<br>
	indeed that answers can be, um, &quot;improved&quot; to fit those preconceptions. I<br>
	more than most should know that, given certain unsavory experiences with<br>
	eejit journalists. NB: It's even more unpleasant to be misquoted when one has<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> The Jazz Butcher v The JBC
	<p>
	Chris sez:<br>
	${icon_blank}          <br>
	Uh uh.  Distressed Gentlefolk, at very least, was released under the monicker<br>
	of &quot;The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}    Yeah, he's right about this, but none of the earlier stuff was recorded<br>
	${icon_blank}    as the JBC.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}   I think we should interpret the next album as being the last<br>
	${icon_blank}    released under the JBC name as the last album to be released under the<br>
	${icon_blank}    name &quot;the JBC&quot; or &quot;The JB&quot;.<br>
	${icon_blank}          <br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  I really doubt that Pat is going to stop recording as the Jazz Butcher.  I<br>
	${icon_blank}    mean, even though Pat does not have a marketing department, I am sure<br>
	${icon_blank}    that he realizes that when you spend ten years releasing albums and<br>
	${icon_blank}    touring and building up a (for lack of a better term) 'cult' following,<br>
	${icon_blank}    you do not abandon name recognition.  Its what catches people's eye in<br>
	${icon_blank}    the record store and in the concert listings.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}    I dunno - what do you all think?  Might it have something to do with<br>
	${icon_blank}    being tired of being in a band with other people and wanting to go back<br>
	${icon_blank}    to being more autonomous?<br>

	Miles, I only read this on the list recently.  The &quot;real&quot; version of the<br>

	...<br>
	monkeyface<br>
	she's a yoyo<br>
	...<br>
	racheland<br>
	<br>
	i.e. Sky switched the sides of the album for some strange screwy reason.<br>
	I do like the album better when you play it in the right order.  Sky must<br>
	have forgotten that sometimes the order of songs matters, just as the<br>
	order of the notes make up a tune.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Name abandonment
	<p>
	Regardless of the merits or demerits of abandoning a name, <br>
	it seems pretty clear to me that he's talking about the name<br>
	Jazz Butcher in all its permutations, not just &quot;Jazz Butcher<br>
	Conspiracy.&quot; His post said the name has become a millstone<br>
	around his neck. It wouldn't make sense for him to say that<br>
	with respect to &quot;JBC&quot; but not intend to include &quot;JB&quot; in his<br>
	pessimistic diagnosis.<br>
	<br>
	Other bands that have done similar things... Game Theory, <br>
	boiled down to one guy in the end, became &quot;The Loud Family.&quot;<br>
	I believe he lost a lot of listeners, though a long time lag<br>
	may also have contributed. Bob Mould became Sugar and added<br>
	lots of listeners. Big Audio Dynamite became Big Audio<br>
	Dynamite II and increased their US airplay. And of course,<br>
	everyone who goes solo does this, in a manner of speaking.<br>
	He doesn't have much to lose, really, and lots to gain,<br>
	though I will miss the name too.<br>

	<p>
	Well, hardly much of a subject, but anyhow, just a personal JBC note:<br>
	<br>
	Today I was manning the display for the Science Fiction Club at &quot;Clubs<br>
	Days&quot; in the Campus Centre of UW.  Since I had manned it the two previous<br>
	days and been a bit bored by the music, I brought in Waiting For The Love<br>
	Bus and had it played once while I was manning the booth.  According to the<br>
	Turnkey, it was pretty well received, which can only mean that people<br>
	actually liked it enough to be bothered to go up to the desk to ask <br>
	what was being played.<br>
	<br>
	And Sony doesn't think it can make money on the album in Canada.  Hmph.<br>

	i was just giving my copy of that canadian compilation Unconditional<br>
	a listen (thanks chris! any chance you can get more of those - it<br>
	really is an excellect compilation)<br>
	<br>
	aside from finally being able to hear some old tunes again<br>
	(all my vinyl is in storage), i was amazed how long The Human Jungle<br>
	is - 7:20.<br>
	<br>
	i know a couple of songs on Condition Blue or maybe Big Planet<br>
	may approach that length, but i always remembered Human Jungle<br>
	as being the typical pop-single lengthed ditty.  nope.<br>
	<br>
	i anticipate quite a bit of warm-fuzzy posting when the<br>
	re-issues of the Glass records finally comes about.<br>
	<br>
	Southern Mark Smith, despite being over 10 years old<br>
	really stands out respectably - it is quite a bit &quot;nicer&quot; than<br>
	the raucous live versions i am have become used to.<br>
	the newly-reformatted lyric information on the WWW server show<br>
	that Southern Mark Smith appears on more releases than any other JBC tune -<br>
	7 times:<br>
	A Scandal In Bohemia, Southern Mark Smith single, Real Men single,<br>
	The Gift Of Music, Bloody Nonsense, Unconditional, and Western Family<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> oh dear (shirts)
	<p>
	Did anyone receive a L natural shirt that they didn't order, and then NOT<br>
	complain to me about it?  I have a problem between what I have left on<br>
	paper, and what I actually have.  Methinks someone may be disappointed and/or<br>
	a new order will have to be placed.<br>
	<br>
	For those of you who are new to the list and don't know, after much <br>
	discussion on the list about designs etc I had some Jazz Butcher shirts<br>
	made up, and almost everyone who ordered a shirt now has theirs.  (Some<br>
	people took longer to send their cheques than others.)  I have a few<br>
	unclaimed shirts - a couple of XL whites for sure - and if you are<br>
	interested in some other size or colour I can take your name and<br>
	preference and maybe when a dozen shirts are wanted, I'll do another<br>
	run.  (Or sooner if I can't resolve the problem above.)<br>
	<br>
	ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ORDER MORE SHIRTS (there, that should have gotten<br>
	the attention of people who dozed off after &quot;For those of you who are<br>
	new...&quot;) let me know that you're interested.  For anyone who cares,<br>
	there is a lot more info on the shirts available by WWW now - you can<br>
	either go to the list's WWW page, go to the shirts page, and then<br>
	click on my name, or go directly to<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> 15 Nov 94 - Greenpeace Benefit at the Roadmender's, Northampton
	<p>
	&gt; From: m_cockerill@icrf.icnet.uk (Matt Cockerill)<br>
	<br>
	***David, can you forward this to the list, thanks, Matt*****<br>
	<br>
	Yes, it's come and gone. I made it along though, and was rewarded with the<br>
	opportunity to hear Mr Odd, Sister Death, President Chang, She's a Yo-yo,<br>
	She's on Drugs, Our Friends the Filth, and Bakersfield. i.e. the same old<br>
	set list they've been playing for 18 months.<br>
	<br>
	Chiefly notable thing about this particular performance was Dooj dressed up<br>
	in a very convincing &quot;Grim Reaper&quot; outfit, with scythe, cape and silly<br>
	makeup. Something to do with the Mexican Day of the Dead, apparently.<br>
	<br>
	My brother Sam and I accosted Pat and co. afterwards, and asked why they<br>
	never play &quot;Chickentown&quot; in Northampton. Pat seemed to think it was a good<br>
	idea. Very doubtful wheter anyone in Northampton would twig what he was<br>
	singing about.<br>
	<br>
	Gabriel admirably said he had been in favour of not playing Mr Odd this<br>
	time out, but he had been over-ruled by Pat. That makes it about 9 gigs<br>
	I've been to, and they've played Mr Odd at every one. (And Sister Death<br>
	too, come to think of it, but that's fair enough)<br>
	<br>
	News on the recording front is good. David J is said to be hard at work<br>
	mixing the 17 tracks Pat and the gang laid down over the last few weeks.<br>
	Pat says it's very upbeat. Plenty of songs in the Pineapple<br>
	Tuesday/Penguins mode.<br>
	<br>
	Other thing Pat mentioned was that he has managed to visit the WWW site,<br>
	and was very disappointed not to be able to find the sample of the audience<br>
	at Creation's Albert Hall gig shouting &quot;Fuck Off&quot; in Czech.<br>
	<br>
	The rest of the benefit was pretty interesting: a college band with a<br>
	would-be John Lydon lead singer trying desperately to impress the record<br>
	industry types who may or may  not have been there, and a punk-noise band<br>
	(not unlike Rollins Band, I suspect) who were excellently loud and<br>
	mindless.<br>
	<br>
	Pat sensibly declined the offer to headline after these guys, but had a<br>
	great time beforehand  playing over their fuck loud P.A. . Makes a change<br>
	from Slurps, at least. President Chang became a theatrical noise experience<br>
	not a million miles from Sonic Youth (almost).<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> &quot;Gary Hunter&quot; &lt;ghunter@science.watstar.uwaterloo.ca&gt;
	<br><b>Subject:</b> Has anyone bought these lately...?
	<p>
	Chris sez:<br>
	<br>
	&gt;Hell, Gary, if you have seen any of these for sale, for heavens sake BUY THEM!<br>
	&gt;Particularly Scandal/Sex &amp; Travel.<br>
	&gt;We are talking about VERY VERY rare here!!  Possible Fire rereleases<br>
	&gt;sometime but...<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Then Eric sez:<br>
	<br>
	&gt;I've been looking for A Scandal in Bohemia, either on LP or CD, for about<br>
	&gt;4 years now.  I've yet to see it.  My local Virgin Megastore lists a CD<br>
	&gt;of A Scandal in Bohemia as having been released at one time (this shocked<br>
	&gt;me), but it must be out of print.<br>
	&gt;I've got G of M 1&amp;2 on vynil, but have never seen them on CD.<br>
	&gt;This is embarrassing, but what's Sex and Travel?  What's on it?<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Plus, John (who had trouble posting) sez:<br>
	<br>
	&gt;As far as I know, these records have never been available in the United States<br>
	&gt;(and while a few were undoubtably imported, I've never seen them in the import<br>
	&gt;bins). Until this message, I wasn't aware they were still available anywhere.<br>
	&gt;If anyone knows how I might get them (or perhaps has a current address for<br>
	&gt;Glass Records), please drop me a line! I prefer CDs, but will also buy vinyl<br>
	&gt;and tapes.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Hmm, yes they seem quite rare.  I asked about those CDs 'cause I've only<br>
	managed to buy Distressed Gentlefolk on CD, which is looking more and more<br>
	valuable as time goes by! (it's an original Glass Records import).<br>
	${icon_blank}  Chris sez there maybe some re-releases on the way, BONUS!!!.<br>
	${icon_blank}  And Eric is embarrassed.  Don't worry, just get your FAQs straight.<br>
	${icon_blank}  Finally John, your posting trouble _may_ be due to sending to the the wrong<br>
	address.  Don't forget, it's jbc-list@pasture.ecn.purdue.edu .  :)  Plus I'll<br>
	go home and get you the address I have (it might not be current though).  But<br>
	didn't Glass Records go bankrupt?  I'm not sure if they even exist anymore.<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}  Zero else, Toast and Gare<br>

	<br><b>From:</b> greg0003@gold.tc.umn.edu
	<br><b>Subject:</b> a new one
	<p>
	Tried to send this earlier, but forgot the &quot;pasture&quot; . . .<br>
	<br>
	Glad to be here . . . found the address in the Ultimate Music listing <br>
	(whatever it's called) on the WWW (very attractive home page too!).  I'm <br>
	partial to &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;Condition Blue,&quot; if I had to <br>
	declare; have seen the Conspiracy twice at First Avenue here in <br>
	Minneapolis, once in like 1986 (just before &quot;Distressed Gentlefolk&quot; came <br>
	out, I think . . . got to chat with Mr Fish afterward, what a personable <br>
	fellow) and once just a couple years ago, when &quot;Condition Blue&quot; was <br>
	pretty new.  *That was the darkest, saddest, most potent concert I've <br>
	ever seen . . . nearly all bitter, slow, distorted tunes . . . opened <br>
	with (if I remember correctly) &quot;Racheland;&quot; the crowd was rather <br>
	unresponsive until the band kicked into one of the &quot;She's . . .&quot; songs, <br>
	both of which had been in heavy rotation on our slim-pickins alternative <br>
	radio station.  The audience moshed and flailed and all, and after the <br>
	wild applause Pat fairly sneered, &quot;So, the kiddies wanna rock, huh?  <br>
	Well, bite on *this, kiddies!&quot; and played &quot;Sister Death.&quot;  Ahahahaha.<br>
	<br>
	Other than that . . . I suppose you all here have been through the matter <br>
	of the early Jazz Butcher albums' unavailability on cd . . . my co-worker <br>
	at th'record store has the Glass &quot;Scandal/Sex&amp;Travel&quot; cd, but that's <br>
	actually the only copy I've ever seen.  Someone here must know the latest, <br>
	and will perhaps <br>
	bear with me if this is heavily-trodden ground.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Thank you.<br>
	<br>
	So others are curious about the old records.  I bought the &quot;G of M&quot; cd some <br>
	six years ago in Mpls; the lps were available up until about then, and show <br>
	up in the used bins every so often nowadays.  I think I've got all the lps:  <br>
	&quot;Bath of Bacon,&quot; &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia,&quot; &quot;Sex and Travel&quot; (six song ep), <br>
	&quot;The Gift of Music,&quot; (only vol 1 though), &quot;Live in Hamburg&quot; . . . that may <br>
	be all.  Plus a few assorted 12&quot;ers.  What I really want is the 7&quot; that came <br>
	with &quot;Big Questions (The Gift of Music vol 2).&quot;  With the exquisite parodic <br>
	thrust against Mr. David J (he does that a lot, doesn't he?), &quot;The Hairbrush <br>
	and the Tank.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	She said she liked The Soft Boys best . . .<br>

	No, wait, they started the show with &quot;Still and All.&quot;  I knew it couldn't be <br>
	something so cheerful as &quot;Racheland.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	I think Glass did go under.  What a magnificent label.  I remember being <br>
	seventeen and buying &quot;50,000 Glass Fans Can't Be Wrong&quot; (on clear vinyl, no <br>
	less!), then writing them a letter begging to be some sort of American <br>
	correspondent.  Butcher, Eider, Sudden, Kusworth, Spacemen 3, Mayo Thompson, <br>
	Pastels, David J, Outskirts . . . and a band I've never heard from again, <br>
	Peter Sellers and the Hollywood Party.  A supergroup one-off?  A joke?  A <br>
	damn fine song, in any case.  &quot;Chaotic Shampoo and Strange Rock 'n' Roll&quot; or <br>
	something along those lines.<br>

	Could it be that Glass only pressed ONE copy of each release? Seems like<br>

	`KCRW Santa Monica (1988?)'. Speedy Gonzales I can't find, which makes<br>

	Also, let me retract the attribution for `Speedy Gonzales' -- my brain<br>
	was misfiring. *Roadrunner* is, of course, the tune written by <br>
	Mr.  Richman, and covered by Pat on (amongst possibly other places) the <br>
	`Hamburg' live album. <br>
	<br>
	Digging through the tapes revealed a couple of more tunes:<br>
	<br>
	&gt;From the DavidJ - Pat Fish show in Northampton, December 1993:<br>
	${icon_blank}  Little Red Corvette		(yes, the Prince tune)<br>

	I tend to prefer the Ramones' version over Pat's, as Pat sort of sucked the life<br>

	<br>
	Consider my off-hand remark as an acknowledgment that both albums have<br>
	both devout followers and outspoken critics, combine this with the fact that<br>
	they're both down-on-the-floor-but-not-quite-out albums, and you'll do<br>

	Personalities (well, he did a single before that, but the band was <br>
	called Teen 78 or something). If you don't know them, may I recommend <br>
	the albums &quot;And Don't the Kids Just Love It,&quot; &quot;They Could Have Been <br>
	Bigger Than The Beatles,&quot; or &quot;Privilege.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	At the time they recorded Part Time Punks, the TVPs also included Ed <br>
	Ball, who would later be responsible for the equally wonderful band The <br>
	Times.<br>
	<br>
	We now return you to your regularly scheduled debate as to whether <br>
	Condition Blue's crap or gold--no surprise, by the way, is it, that <br>
	CB's the album which generates the most intensely PERSONAL feelings? (By <br>
	the way, it's a GEM. So there.)<br>

	<p>
	Wow! Am I ever glad I found this mailing list! I first heard Jazz <br>
	Butcher back in the mid to late 80's. I bought one of their tapes and <br>
	LOVED it! Well, as fate would have it, that tape was lost years ago <br>
	and I never got around to getting it and now I have forgotten the <br>
	name of it and the name of most of the songs on it. <br>
	${icon_blank}    Anyway, I want to get it again before I start getting the rest. I <br>
	got the impression that it was a compilation album. Some of the songs <br>
	were Big Saturday?, Real Men?, So and so's Birthday present(it was a <br>
	womans name, contained lines about a fish and an elevator?), a song <br>
	about the devil- Devil is my Friend? etc. <br>
	${icon_blank}    I really want this record again! Any help mas to what it is <br>
	called and if it is avaliable would be great. It would have come out <br>
	1988 or earlier.<br>
	${icon_blank}    Thanks alot,<br>

	Mark E. Smith is the off-centre genius behind The Fall.<br>
	He comes from Manchester, which counts as The North.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> Southern Mark E. Smith
	<p>
	I don't believe when Fishy says that &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot; isn't a <br>
	reference to Mark E. Smith.  It's his first single.  At the time he was <br>
	probably just getting serious about trying to devote his life to his <br>
	music.  The song is about people finding out what's important to them in <br>
	life, like the Pope.  Mark E. Smith is a very serious (pretentious?) <br>
	musician who has clearly found out what makes his heart sing.  Fish is a <br>
	very lighthearted musician who has found out what makes his heart sing.  <br>
	Smith is (or was, until the &quot;Manchester&quot; thing) very strongly associated <br>
	with Northern music.  So Fish wants to be a Southern, lighthearted <br>
	version of Mark Smith.  The line on the _Scandal_ version of &quot;Southern <br>
	Mark Smith,&quot; &quot;hey, don't you know they only make pop records out of <br>
	plastic&quot; tells listeners to not take pop music too seriously, as Mark E. <br>
	Smith, or at least his serious fans, do.  Fish also sings about coming <br>
	out to clubs, being trendy (&quot;put on your best friend's anorak), and <br>
	checking out the music.  He is suggesting that listeners make the music <br>
	scene a part of their life, as Smith has done in a rather serious way, <br>
	and Fish has done in a much more lighthearted way.<br>
	<br>
	Sorry, I have no life, and thus spend too much time thinking about pop <br>
	songs.  Hopefully I'd fall into the Southern school and not the Northern <br>
	school.<br>
	<br>
	Hmm, I think I'll have another of those . . . <br>

	&gt; I don't believe when Fishy says that &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot; isn't a <br>
	&gt; reference to Mark E. Smith.  It's his first single.<br>
	<br>
	on the WWW server see<br>
	&lt;a href=&quot;${jbc_letters}/93Oct19/fall.html&quot;&gt;the following document&lt;/a&gt;<br>
	where pat talked about this:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}	We put out the single Southern Mark Smith in the<br>
	${icon_blank}	autumn of 1983. The Fall's C.R.E.E.P., with Pat,<br>
	${icon_blank}	Trip Dispenser on the b-side, came out about the<br>
	${icon_blank}	same time. Therefore, I feel that it must have been<br>
	${icon_blank}	recorded some time BEFORE the Fall could have<br>
	${icon_blank}	heard our single. Our bassist at the time (and on the<br>
	${icon_blank}	single) was none other than Rolo (woodentops)<br>
	${icon_blank}	McGinty. Accordingly, the combination of the Fall title<br>
	${icon_blank}	and Smith's strangled cries of &quot;McGinty!&quot; on the<br>
	${icon_blank}	record did make for rather spooky listening, but I<br>
	${icon_blank}	believe it's just a co-incidence. A little later we<br>
	${icon_blank}	received a letter from The Fall, from which we<br>
	${icon_blank}	gathered that they dug our record, and later we did<br>
	${icon_blank}	quite a few dates supporting them.<br>
	<br>
	if pat told someone that he was *not* refering to Mr Fall,<br>
	he was probably not being truthful.<br>

	<p>
	This is probably re-hashed news to most of you who have been around this list <br>
	for a while, but since I just joined recently, I thought I'd throw out my latest<br>
	JBC discovery.  While listening closely to Cult of the Basement this evening, I <br>
	finally paid attention to the sample at the beginning of The Basement, that <br>
	funky little Mediterranean instrumental that appetizes the ears for the fine <br>
	musical feast that follows.  The sample goes:<br>
	<br>
	What satellite is it coming from?<br>
	Snooker, I think.<br>
	Country of origin?<br>
	<br>
	That struck a chord with my failing memory.  I rushed to my little video <br>
	library, sifted through the dusty stacks and pulled out Videodrome, that early <br>
	80's David Cronenberg film starring James Woods and good ol' Blondie.  Yes, yes,<br>
	I had it pinned, it was from the early scene where James Woods' character was <br>
	asking his video pirate friend about the origin of his pirate Videodrome tapes! <br>
	<br>
	Like I said, you all probably have known this since Cult was released.  However,<br>
	nothing like the feeling of conquest on a Tuesday evening!<br>
	<br>
	Leads me to wonder how many film dialogues have been dubbed in JBC songs.  I <br>
	know on Big Planet Scarey Planet, in Burglar of Love, that Kyle MacLaughlin is <br>
	dubbed saying &quot;He is a very sick and dangerous man&quot; from the film Blue Velvet.  <br>
	There are also some very humorous samples in Do the Bubonic Plague which I do <br>
	not recognize.  (He passed out?  My God!!)  Anyone know where these are from?  <br>
	And, even more importantly, what is the business with Way Best Chicken?  Is this<br>
	some inside Brit joke?   :) <br>

	<p>
	As the list's resident Fall-head, I have to reply.<br>
	<br>
	Stephen Larsen writes:<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Mark E. Smith is a very serious (pretentious?) <br>
	&gt; musician who has clearly found out what makes his heart sing.  Fish is a <br>
	&gt; very lighthearted musician who has found out what makes his heart sing.  <br>
	<br>
	Erm, I think you've completely misread the Fall. Few bands are as funny, few <br>
	singers as bitingly funny as Smith. The difference between Pat and Mark's humor <br>
	is the difference between, say, the Marx Brothers and Kubrick's Dr. <br>
	Strangelove: One is more obviously humorous, more directly lighthearted. The <br>
	other is much darker, much more bitter, but every bit as funny. And absolutely <br>
	intended to be so.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Smith is (or was, until the &quot;Manchester&quot; thing) very strongly associated <br>
	&gt; with Northern music.  So Fish wants to be a Southern, lighthearted <br>
	&gt; version of Mark Smith.  The line on the _Scandal_ version of &quot;Southern <br>
	&gt; Mark Smith,&quot; &quot;hey, don't you know they only make pop records out of <br>
	&gt; plastic&quot; tells listeners to not take pop music too seriously, as Mark E. <br>
	&gt; Smith, or at least his serious fans, do.  <br>
	<br>
	I'd argue Pat is making light of the very _notion_ of a Southern Mark Smith <br>
	being possible. Being Mancunian is so completely part of what Smith is. . . .<br>

	&gt; Southern Mark Smith is indeed one of my JBC favorites (either version!)...<br>
	&gt; But I have *never* been able to extract from anyone, be they English, or<br>
	&gt; English Majors, exactly what *is* a Southern Mark Smith?<br>
	&gt; Surely someone in the online JBC brain-trust can help!<br>

	I've often wondered if it's a reference to Mark E. Smith of the Fall, who<br>
	is after all from the Midlands.  But that's only a guess...<br>

	<p>
	Fearless Leader says he, too, thinks Pat was being disingenuous when he denied <br>
	&quot;SMS&quot; is about the Fall. I agree, as I had very much the same conversation with <br>
	Pat about two years ago. However, there's one thing that seems mista'en in the <br>

	<br>
	${icon_blank}	Accordingly, the combination of the Fall title<br>
	${icon_blank}	and Smith's strangled cries of &quot;McGinty!&quot; on the<br>

	${icon_blank}	believe it's just a co-incidence.<br>
	<br>
	Actually, Smith's rant isn't all that strangled:<br>
	<br>
	${icon_blank}    	McGinty thought he could fool the fall <br>
	${icon_blank}    	with his imitation speeds<br>
	${icon_blank}        But he could not know the psychic nose. . . .<br>
	<br>
	Damn. Should've asked Brixie Smith about that when she was last in Chi. <br>
	<br>
	Last word: Anyone who hasn't should check out Fall's _458489 A-Sides_, an<br>
	ace retrospective that's just been reissued. Delightfully warped pop.<br>

	<p>
	Golly. Oi`m just a country lad, me, so you`ll excuse me if my<br>
	communication suffers from chronic future-shock mind-fuck scenario...<br>
	&quot;Oh no, not C.F.S.M.F.S.,&quot; I hear you squawk, &quot;Not that old sucker.&quot;<br>
	Hello, Turner here, tuning in and freaking out (not to mention<br>
	passing out... the facilities for...erm...maintaining the students at<br>
	this here seat of learning are to be recommended) on the orgy of<br>
	facts, figures and fun that is ButcherFunk International. And,<br>
	frankly, I`m impressed (not to say a little bewildered at the sheer<br>
	volume of shit contained herein).<br>
	<br>
	I guess that, seeing as I`m here now, I ought to contribute some<br>
	information which may be deemed as of some interest, but I hear<br>
	(through slightly more conventional means of communication... the<br>
	British Royal Mail is a wonderful thing) that Fishy himself has<br>
	already been in telecommunicational enlightenment mode and, being the<br>
	technological ingenue that I am, I cannot find said missive myself,<br>
	so you`ll have to forgive me if I repeat (or wildly contradict) shit<br>
	contributed by the big B. I s`pose I`d also better think of something<br>
	to say (heck, I just wanted to dial up, I didn`t realise you actually<br>
	had to have things to say)...<br>
	<br>
	Also (in strictly Teutonic terms)... It seems to have filtered<br>
	through that we`ve now finished recording the new waxing... I have a<br>
	cassette of it in my pocket right at this moment... and, to tell the<br>
	honest, I (at least) think it`s a damned fine record (I`m allowed to<br>
	say shit like that... I`m just the drummer and, as such, am permitted<br>
	neither pride nor modesty nor blame for the sonic dribblings of the,<br>
	uh, artistic members of the band). Whilst sat at the desk, quietly<br>
	muttering to himself in the `eccentric` manner of all producers,<br>
	David J. was heard to mutter the epithet `definitive`, and I for one<br>
	would like to think that he wasn`t entirely talking drug-addled<br>
	hyperbole. It does a rather fine job of encapsulating most of the<br>
	spectrum of Butcher recordings (i.e. bits of it are almost as<br>
	miserable as Condition Blue, and other bits are, in all candour,<br>
	stupid). McGee is letting us have a single (a rarity in this country,<br>
	I believe &quot;Girl Go&quot; was the last), and the current concensus seems to<br>
	have a song called Sixteen Years&quot; marked out as prime contender<br>
	(broadly, I have to say that I agree... it pulss off a trick<br>
	essential in a good pop single, namely that it sounds at it`s very<br>
	best on one`s first listening). I think Pat might favour &quot;Cute<br>
	Submarines&quot; as the choice, but it bothers me that, although it`s<br>
	certainly one of the stronger tracks we`ve recorded, it`s precisely<br>
	the kind of thing that has us branded &quot;risible&quot; in some<br>
	(unenlightened) corners. Still, he`s the Butcher. Whatev....<br>
	<br>
	We`re still looking for a title for the album (all suggestions<br>
	gratefully ridiculed)... pace-setters from the brainstorming session<br>
	include &quot;The Bad Neighbourhood&quot;, &quot;Church of Snakes&quot;, &quot;Your Kids Are<br>
	All Evil&quot;, &quot;Punk Punk Punk Punk Punk&quot; and, considering that this is<br>
	the Butcher`s (difficult) tenth album, &quot;One More Than Beethoven&quot;. Oh<br>
	and Pat likes &quot;Progressive&quot;. Me? I want to call the record<br>
	&quot;Doojophilia&quot;, but I think I`m gonna be overruled on the grounds that<br>
	it`s a fucking dumb idea. Dooj has played a blinder on this outing,<br>
	burbling away like a trooper. DOOJ IS COOL, as the studio catchphrase<br>
	had it. And so say all of us. This slogan should be added to his<br>
	biog. Do it now, you know it makes sense.<br>
	<br>
	Um... I think that`s about as much recording gossip as I can be doing<br>
	with (largely on the grounds that, in the face of the magnificent and<br>
	replete Butch-fest that I find myself presently linked to, I can`t<br>
	believe that anybody finds us THAT interesting). Previous communiques<br>
	seem to indicate that you are after a bit of other information, which<br>
	reads as follows:<br>
	<br>
	GABRIEL ALEXANDER (Yowsa, not another one) TURNER (The Bishop):<br>
	Drumming, singing, smoking, drinking.<br>
	The only regular patron of the Love Bus under thirty (like by ten<br>
	years, as it goes). Joined J.B.C. through pure serendipity in spring<br>
	1994 (The story briefly: Gabriel is JBC fan. Gabriel goes to see JBC<br>
	perform in London - New Cross Venue, November 27th 1993. Gabriel<br>
	notices that JBC are drumless (I`m disappointed that there is no<br>
	mention of COLIN - JBC drum machine, spritual mentor and, unlike the<br>
	rest of the band, also in The Black Eg - in your list of<br>

	makes mental note to speak to Butcher post gig. Butcher plays gig.<br>
	Butcher breaks guitar. Gabriel decides this not right time to speak<br>
	to Butcher. Gabriel goes home and writes Butcher letter. Butcher<br>
	calls Gabriel. &quot;Fancy playing drums for us,&quot; asks Butcher. &quot;Yowsa,&quot;<br>
	replies Gabriel. And the rest is disturbingly extensively documented<br>
	elsewhere in technoland).<br>
	Turner keywords: Jagermeister, Maxwin, Yokel.<br>
	<br>
	I had more to dribble, but I`m being forcibly ejected...<br>

	New JBC lp duly completed in secure Northampton location.1994 live line-up<br>
	stumbled through a series of tunes and such under Butcher's direction, aided<br>
	and abetted by a number of the usual suspects; Alex Lee on guitar, Alex Green<br>
	on saxes, that sort of thing.Max Read was engineer for the session, and he also<br>
	contributed a lot of the backing vocals.He is a good looking chap, non-smoker,<br>
	very able and agreable.Judge Curtis was on hand to play the Hungarian<br>
	Stock Whip.<br>
	&quot;Where did you get that?&quot;<br>
	&quot;I got it from Jane.&quot;<br>
	&quot;Jane who?&quot;<br>
	&quot;Jane the Pain, who do you think?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	A chap from Stranger Tractors called Bolly played dijeridoo on one number.<br>
	Writer currently unable to establish JBC motives behind this.<br>
	Musical Dave, of Northampton combo Ubu Swirl (Do they know that the JBC call<br>
	them &quot;Hobo Swill&quot;?), contributed a spiffy guitar,and there were further vocal<br>
	contributions by friends and family.The WOLFS, I am assured, are not a sample.<br>
	The Butcher mixed one or two of the shorter tracks, but the vast majority of<br>
	the mixing was handled - in his own inimitable style -  by producer DAVID J.<br>
	David gave the impression that he was having a whale of a time.<br>

	The JBC themselves are agreed that &quot;Man 0f The Match&quot; on this record has to<br>
	be Dooj.Apart from dismissing his bass parts in about 36 minutes, he also<br>
	contributed guitar and some astonishing backing singing....and he plays the<br>
	SYNTHESISER!Moves instituted by the drummer to entitle the album &quot;DOOJ IS COOL&quot; were, <br>
	however, swiftly and brutally suppressed by the ruling junta.The title remains a<br>
	mystery.<br>
	<br>
	Songs (and stuff) on the record are as follows, though no definitive order has<br>
	yet been established.(The Butcher won't let any of the band have a cassette copy.)<br>
	A GREAT VISITATION OF ELEPHANTS<br>
	WHEN ENO SINGS<br>
	THE UGLIEST SONG IN THE WORLD<br>
	SCARLETT<br>
	BEETLE GEORGE<br>
	COPS AND HOSPITALS<br>
	TRUCK OF FEAR<br>
	BLUES FOR DEAN READ<br>
	WAITING FOR SUMO<br>
	OLD SNAKEY<br>
	LAND<br>
	LULU'S NIGHTMARE<br>
	CUTE SUBMARINES<br>
	SURF GEAR IN IDAHO<br>
	16 YEARS<br>
	TRUE STORIES<br>
	<br>
	There are supposed to be a couple of out-takes floating around too.<br>
	The idea is that Creation in London will be issuing a single of &quot;16 Years&quot; in<br>
	January 1995, and then releasing the LP in February, after which the JBC will<br>
	be gratefully dusting off their passports and going back to Full Employment<br>
	within the EU and beyond.<br>
	<br>
	Northampton-area residents may be entranced to know about the<br>
	JBC CHRISTMAS IN THE FRIDGE event which will be taking place on Weds. 21st December<br>
	in a LARGE TENT in back of Slurps Bar. Bridge Street, Northampton.<br>
	The 5-piece JBC will appear (it is not known whether Dooj or his<br>
	grisly substitute will be on bass), supported by D.J.s and Judge<br>
	Curtis' excellent Stranger Tractors.- <br>
	<br>
	That's your lot from the Sports Desk.<br>

	<br>
	&gt; Keith Jones &lt;keithj@lodgstud.demon.co.uk&gt;<br>
	&gt; New JBC lp duly completed in secure Northampton location.  1994<br>
	&gt; live line-up stumbled through a series of tunes and such under<br>
	&gt; Butcher's direction, aided and abetted by a number of the usual<br>
	&gt; suspects; Alex Lee on guitar, Alex Green on saxes, that sort of<br>
	&gt; thing.Max Read was engineer for the session, and he also<br>
	&gt; contributed a lot of the backing vocals.He is a good looking<br>
	&gt; chap, non-smoker, very able and agreable.Judge Curtis was on hand<br>
	&gt; to play the Hungarian Stock Whip.<br>
	<br>
	i think i have reason to accost pat by phone..<br>
	even though that post was from &quot;Keith Jones&quot;, such a person<br>
	is not even on the mailing list.<br>
	<br>
	my guess is that pat finally managed his way around a non-typewriting<br>
	keyboard.  should we all feel humble or scared to death is my question.<br>
	<br>
	i think that it is hilarious that Gabriel beat him to the honor<br>
	of being &quot;First Cyber Conspirator&quot; by about 6 hours.<br>
	<br>
	&gt; There are supposed to be a couple of out-takes floating around<br>
	&gt; too.   The idea is that Creation in London will be issuing a<br>
	&gt; single of &quot;16 Years&quot; in January 1995, and then releasing the LP<br>
	&gt; in February, after which the JBC will be gratefully dusting off<br>
	&gt; their passports and going back to Full Employment within the EU<br>
	&gt; and beyond.<br>
	&gt; (The Butcher won't let any of the band have a cassette copy.)<br>
	<br>
	this sounds good.  the part about the single, i mean.<br>
	&quot;Full Employment&quot;? since when were the brothers employed?<br>
	<br>
	and from Gabriel via his friend (M &quot;not Mitch&quot; Jenkins):<br>
	&gt; M.G.J.Jenkins@exeter.ac.uk<br>
	&gt; It seems to have filtered through that we`ve now finished<br>
	&gt; recording the new waxing...  I have a cassette of it in my pocket<br>
	&gt; right at this moment...<br>
	<br>
	better not let pat know - course, I won't tell him if you send a copy :-)<br>
	<br>
	Gabriel, could you keep us up-to-date on gig dates and stuff?<br>
	thanks..<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> JBC (pat post?) WAS NOT FROM PAT
	<p>
	I am sorry to have misled anyone, but the post<br>
	from Keith Jones &lt;keithj@lodgstud.demon.co.uk&gt; was not Pat.<br>
	Although all of the information is accurate, at this time,<br>
	it is a mystery who is posing as &quot;Keith Jones&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Keith Jones&quot; is what the Spanish-speaking fan base of the<br>
	JBC believe Pat's real name to be.  He told me that in early years,<br>
	someone during tour must have (jokingly) told a reporter in Spain<br>
	that the singer's name is Keith Jones, and the media continue<br>
	to use that pseudo-fact.<br>
	<br>
	Whoever submitted that message knows this - in addition to<br>
	their ability to quote in-studio conversations.  Pat is on the case.<br>
	<br>
	JBC-v-Internet:<br>
	${icon_blank}	While the band were in the studio, they had the opportunity<br>
	${icon_blank}	to look at the WWW pages.  Pat seems to have a keen interest<br>
	${icon_blank}	on being able to communicate more directly with y'all, so<br>
	${icon_blank}	do not be surprised if he eventually shows up here.<br>
	${icon_blank}	I predict ImmanentDeathOfTheJBC-List.<br>
	<br>
	About the new album:<br>
	${icon_blank}	Out in February.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Still no title. (Gabriel - could you scan your cover art for us?)<br>
	${icon_blank}	Unless the world recognizes this one as something special,<br>
	${icon_blank}	come this time next year, the party will truly be over.<br>
	${icon_blank}	(at least under the name Jazz Butcher).<br>
	<br>
	Some Tunes:<br>
	${icon_blank}	The Ugliest Song In The World<br>
	${icon_blank}		this is NOT about the Blue Aeroplanes.<br>
	${icon_blank}		David J agreed with Pat that Dooj's vocals<br>
	${icon_blank}		at the end sound &quot;just like Max&quot;.<br>
	${icon_blank}	Truck Of Fear<br>
	${icon_blank}		wolf sounds are actually Pat and Dave howling<br>
	${icon_blank}		(with the door open so that they can see the moon,<br>
	${icon_blank}		much to the bewilderment of the Hell's Angels<br>
	${icon_blank}		next door)<br>
	${icon_blank}	True Stories<br>
	${icon_blank}		not a cover<br>
	<br>
	Western Family master tape:<br>
	${icon_blank}	Until I protested my case, he suggested that I pay<br>
	${icon_blank}	him royalties for these dubs I am making!  He is piiiig.<br>

	<p>
	I'd like to see the JBC do &quot;Outdoor Miner&quot; . . . seems a natural, <br>
	soundwise.  I've only ever heard one cover of that sublime favorite, and <br>
	it sucked a lot.  It was by The Grays.  Ack Pft.<br>
	<br>
	AND, I find myself singing &quot;Our Friends the Filth&quot; and &quot;Shirley <br>
	Maclaine,&quot; neither of which hit home immediately.<br>
	<br>
	and (argh), re: this mortal coil's request, all but one of the songs you <br>
	listed (&quot;Real Men&quot;) are on the collection _Bloody Nonsense_, on (r.i.p.) <br>
	BigTime records.  All but a different song you listed (&quot;The Devil is My <br>
	Friend&quot;) are on _A Scandal in Bohemia_, on (ditto) Glass Records.  Or <br>
	maybe they're all on the _Big Questions_ compilation, which did, I think, <br>
	come out in '87.<br>
	<br>
	My dad likes to say that you haven't lived until you've heard &quot;Caroline <br>
	Wheeler's Birthday Present.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	you know what happens if you leave a fish too long in an elevator?  You <br>
	don't?  Well here's a clue:  fish is biodegradable.<br>

	&gt;&quot;Antiquated, let it go: `consent is success'.<br>
	&gt; I've seen the future and it's birdlime, When girls say 'yes'.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	I think it's important to take the lyrics in context, and the first verse<br>
	describes first meeting and things going well. (Doesn't birdlime also mean<br>
	birdsh*t? Not very positive, especially in context.) Here's my reading on<br>
	it... for what it's worth.<br>
	<br>
	She bends her head just right, so very gracefully, <br>
	Everybody's watching her, everybody smiles,<br>
	Those special lights shine hot on her bare shoulders,<br>
	She never felt so happy in her life,<br>
	Abdicating and letting go, consent is success,<br>
	I've seen the future and it's birdlike, when girls say 'yes'.<br>
	<br>
	The word &quot;success&quot; almost sounds like exceess, and &quot;birdlike&quot; almost sounds<br>
	like &quot;bird-light&quot; as in euphoria and abandon, consistent with the rest of the<br>
	verse.  Either way, I think &quot;bird&quot; should be taken in the context of Brit<br>
	slang for young women, as well as taking wing and soaring to the great<br>
	heights that lead to the inevitable plummet experienced in verses 2 and 3.<br>
	Also note that at the beginning of verse 2, she's &quot;stepping right off an<br>
	airplane&quot;, no doubt beginning the descent. I knew that English degree would<br>
	pay off someday.<br>
	<br>
	And yes, the hole in the roof IS a mess... and Condition Blue rules.<br>
	<br>
	And you kids thought I wasn't paying attention.<br>

	Isn't this fun?<br>
	<br>
	I do agree that it's important to take the lyrics in context.  The question<br>
	is, does the first verse end with &quot;She never felt so happy in her life&quot; or<br>
	not?  I've been reading it as yes, it DOES end the first, and so the two<br>
	lines that I hear &quot;Antiquated...&quot; are separate and a contrast from the<br>
	first four.<br>
	<br>
	Depends on how you see the song; I see it as essentially describing the <br>
	contrast between the happy and beautiful girl and the guy who is going to <br>
	get his insides kicked out, &gt;from the word go&lt;, rather than having an<br>
	ascent and descent.  But I will have a listen to the song again with your<br>
	interpretation in mind, Gary.<br>

	&gt; Somewhat belatedly, for the comprehensive covers list:<br>
	&gt; &quot;Stereo Queen&quot; by Pat's Austrian friend Wolfgang.  Pat's<br>

	<br>
	Wolfgang Stegg (maybe spelt differently) indeed does have<br>
	a recording out, and pat has a copy - whether or not Stereo Queen<br>
	is on it, i cannot recall.  nor do i remember the label, etc.<br>
	there is a simple line drawing on the blue sleeve, though..<br>
	sounds like an pre/after show question for pat.<br>
	<br>
	what i do know is that the album is marvelously STRANGE.<br>
	stuffed with simple acoustic tunes, recorded in a church<br>
	for its natural reverb.  has lots of bassoons and stuff.<br>
	dreamy - and it is all just wolfgang.<br>

	<br><b>Subject:</b> stray steg(g) and other creatures
	<p>
	On the subject of the stray steg / birdleg / from Winnipeg (excuse the<br>
	spelling) I was under the impression that it was a stray Stegosaurus, I<br>
	suppose as Mr Odd is a man out of his time, though the exploits of a stray<br>
	Austrian musician might conceivably be comparable. <br>
	<br>
	Back on the subject of Girls Say Yes, Pete Crouch (one time schoolfriend<br>
	in Henley on Thames) said that it was about &quot;falling in love in Los<br>
	Angeles and getting f***ed up by it&quot;.  Perhaps his guitar playing is more<br>
	eloquent than his plot summaries.   Another person, like Gabriel, who <br>
	joined the JBC by following them around for months on end.   He used to <br>
	be in a band round Henley and Reading called Peter's Walnut Whirls, round <br>
	about 1986-88.   They did covers of Dire Straits and early JBC - hence <br>
	the guitar break on Girls Say Yes sounds like the beautiful lovechild of <br>
	Max Eider and Mark Knopfler.<br>

	All this pop trivia may be on the WWW but I've still not figured out how to <br>

	&gt; What the HELL is the bit they <br>
	&gt; repeat throughout &quot;Big Bad Thing&quot; at the breaks?<br>
	<br>
	It is a fake accent applied to the phrase<br>
	&quot;What You Want?&quot;  (&quot;Vhot You Vhant?&quot;)<br>
	<br>
	(I hardly ever listen to Gentlefolk, but am now,<br>
	and Nothing Special is a really great tune!)<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Is this the alleged &quot;stray Stegg&quot; (&quot;Mr. Odd&quot;)?<br>
	<br>
	nope.<br>
	As far as I know, Mr Fish only knows of Wolfgang Stegg<br>
	since early in 1993 (when he opened for the JBC in Vienna)<br>
	as Pat reported:<br>
	${icon_blank}    11.3 Vienna - Szene Wien 300 people (more?)<br>
	${icon_blank}    Opening act is one &quot;Jac&quot;, a lone 19 year old Austrian<br>
	${icon_blank}    who is brilliant. JBC follow him on and open with<br>
	${icon_blank}    Girls Say Yes, which Lix has just remembered a few minutes<br>
	${icon_blank}    ago. It, and all that follows it, walks a charmed route<br>
	${icon_blank}    through chaos, and by the end of the night I am fairly<br>
	${icon_blank}    sure that this was the best JBC show ever. Many<br>
	${icon_blank}    drunks, nightclubs. Kathie, Lix and I end up in the hotel<br>
	${icon_blank}    manager's apartment.<br>
	<br>
	The phrase &quot;Stray Stegg&quot; dates from the Cult days - 1989<br>
	<br>
	&gt; Michael H Whitworth &lt;michael.whitworth@st-annes.oxford.ac.uk&gt;<br>
	&gt; Thu, 22 Dec 1994 11:04:57 +0000 (GMT)<br>
	&gt; I was under the impression that it was a stray Stegosaurus<br>
	<br>
	true.<br>
	During the 1989 US tour, the JBC were rather enamored with<br>
	saurians - they had sheets and sheets of colorful dinosaur<br>
	stickers from a Highlifes kids magazine which they left stuck<br>
	to dressing room walls across the states.  The animal of the tour<br>
	was a foot-long green plastic stegosaurus, named Spinach.<br>
	At the end of the 89 tour, I was bequeathed ownership, and he<br>
	made a ferocious watch-thing for my apartment for the next year.<br>
	I checked him back onto the JBC tour bus in 1990 and that was<br>
	the last he was heard of.  I hope he is doing well.<br>
	<br>
	The butcher-man recently finished his 37th year.<br>
	Keep it going, old man..<br>
	<br>
	This has been a very active year for the jbc-list!<br>
	&gt;From then to now, the number of posts per year:<br>
	${icon_blank}	1989 - 22<br>
	${icon_blank}	1990 - 61<br>
	${icon_blank}	1991 - 78<br>
	${icon_blank}	1992 - 53<br>
	${icon_blank}	1993 - 119<br>
	${icon_blank}	1994 - 330<br>
	This probably says more about Internet accessibility<br>
	than about the JBC fan-base, but still, it is encouraging.<br>
	<br>
	And, since the WWW server started up in March 1994,<br>
	4781 people have visited the JBC Web site.<br>
	Who knows how many had heard of the group before?<br>
	The fact that people occasionally search for things like<br>
	&quot;Charlie Parker&quot; makes me smile, but still, it is encouraging.<br>
