collection recorded in Lyon (France) between 1982-1990. \n\t\tThe JAZZ BUTCHER were recorded for ZAP FM at the Rail Th&eacute;atre in Lyon in spring 1988. \n\t\tThe complete show was recorded on-the-fly with my usual way of mixing sdb outputs with 4 ambiance mikes to a HiFi video tape \n\t\trecorder. \n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p> \n\t\tFor this night, I've placed 2 ambience mikes (Sennheiser MD441) on each side of the stage and another couple (Sennheiser \n\t\tcardoids) close to the soundboard. \n\t\tThat night, I've a 16 tracks soundboard for recording... \n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p> \n\t\tI took usual sdb outputs on 2 tracks and some individual instruments outputs (from band sdb)... \n\t\tbass drum/snare/bass guitar/2 guitars/vocals completing the last 4 tracks with my 4 microphones. \n\t\tBy this way, you have more than a pure sdb, and, very important, on the recording you have the effects (reverb/delay/etc...) \n\t\tused by the soundman. \n\t\tThis is the main difference with the incomplete recording done on a multitracks recorder and mixed in studio afterwards (LTC \n\t\t216). \n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p> \n\t\tSo this new recording sounds as it was naturally in the venue... and the songs are in the right order... yep!! \n\t\tBad souvenir!!! \n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p> \n\t\tAt the end of the show, I saw a guy steal one of my big Sennheiser on the right side of the stage... \n\t\tI was at the other side of the venue... impossible to catch him. \n\t\tI've recorded a ton of concerts in Lyon, it was the only time I've lost something...

(+ 1 extra track) \n \nVery sad to hear that Pat Fish passed away suddenly. A great talent, passionate about music and a cracking sense of humour. Paying my own tribute by sharing a live gig I recorded when both he and the band I was playing in (Jowe Head's Infernal Contraption) supported The Bevis Frond. Track 8 is taken from when he guested with Television Personalities at a benefit gig for Dan Treacy later that year at the same venue - which for me was the highlight of the night.

Much of this would become the 'Fishcotheque' chapter of 'Miracles and Wonders', the book Pat and I wrote, which I finished and published after he shuffled off on 5th October 2021.\nIt was a lovely, if emotional day.  We ate bagels and smoked cheese at my house, watched the Tottenham game (they lost 3-0 to Brighton), aborted an intended trip to Uppingham, before arriving at the Plough, Shutlanger.  After the recording we went on a little pub crawl, witnessed a skein of geese fly noisily overhead (\"I don't think I've ever seen that before\", said Pat), and consumed a takeaway back at Fishy Mansions.","mediaurl":"https://www.youtube.com//embed/zYpruNL9Rr0","mediacredit":"Philip Snow","mediacrediturl":"https://www.youtube.com/@philipsnow6393"},{"gigsong_id":"1969-12-31
