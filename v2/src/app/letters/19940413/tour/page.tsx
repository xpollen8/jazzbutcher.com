		Day 1 : Travel
		<blockquote>
		The JBC wake up at Michael&apos;s parents&apos; house in Ramsgate.
		The Butcher wrestles with Lemmings on the video game
		machine while everyone else runs around in small circles,
		trying to find a replacement for the tyre on the Love
		Bus that blew out last night.  Eventually one is located
		and we rumble onto a boat bound for Dunkirk.  The boat
		is virtually deserted, but there is a DJ in the bar who
		spins an unbelievable succession R & B and soul classics.
		The trip is over too soon, we land and make our way drunkenly
		to Breda in Holland, where we spend the night with our
		friend Marty.  At about 11:30pm I start teaching Curtis
		the songs.  Right up until last night we were anticipating
		that Richard would be able to disentangle his studio
		commitments, but it was not to be, so Curt was recruited
		this morning, and will now be doing without sleep as
		I march him through about two hours&apos; worth of tunes.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb1.html">Day 2 : Hamburg - <b>Logo</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		Great joy as we reach Germany and have our first proper
		hot meal since leaving Northampton.  Our soundcheck in
		the Logo is long, but Curt is acting like a trouper.
		{owen} stops by and declares himself in favour of this
		diminiutive Scots-Nigerian skinhead.  The Butcher succeeds in
		getting the bus lost in Hamburg (no, I mean, come ON...)
		and Kathie manages to get arrested for running a red
		light on the way to the show.  Somehow she charms her
		way out of trouble and we get to begin the set with
		{wheel} and a brace of truly spectacular timing mistakes.
		The show is at times wildly inaccurate, but high on action
		and good vibrations; we end up playing two encores to
		the home crowd, and retire for a delicious dinner with
		Jones, our German guide, Uli, and a lady from Sony, who
		doesn&apos;t seem to understand that we&apos;re usually a tad tighter
		than that.  She thinks we&apos;re really professional - we
		think we got away with murder!  Several drinks later,
		I leave my beret in a bar and retire to bed.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb2.html">Day 3 : Berlin - <b>Loft</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		Curt, having been equipped with maps of the songs on
		the long journey to Berlin, plays a lot tighter tonight,
		to a slightly larger crowd than Hamburg.  There is a
		vibration of quiet satisfaction on the bus, but not on
		the stage, where the show is once again wild and aggressive.
		Support act Clive Product, a genial English ex-pat, gives
		us one of the most totally vapid fanzines ever written,
		and Steve Winkler, the East German DJ, takes us out for
		an incredible dinner at 2:30 in the morning.  It&apos;s starting
		to look good out here.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb3.html">Day 4: Bremen - <b>Roemer</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		We had spoken too soon.  A small crowd in a vibe-free
		club with a poor P.A. get to see the worst JBC performance
		in about 5 years!  Curt and Nick are all over the shop,
		Dooj and I soon start to follow.  We still get called
		back for more, but it would have taken more than that
		to avert the inevitable and lengthly post-mortem, delivered
		with remarkable taste and decency by yours truly.  It
		does, however, go on and on and on...  Curt goes to bed
		early with a cassette player, and I hit the Jagermeister.
		Early in the evening, however, I did at least get to
		do rather a sweet little solo set on the local radio,
		including - for no very good reason - a cover of {rodney}&apos;s
		<i>Disney Head</i>.  Disney Head, bloody nose...
		and a lot in between.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb4.html">Day 5 : Dortmund -
		<b>Livestation</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		Curt refuses to come out of his headphones until well
		into the soundcheck.  Meanwhile, the rest of us have
		decided that a calmer beginning to the show would make
		it easier for him to fit in.  And so we stumble upon
		the set that we will play - with hardly any variation
		- for the rest of the tour.  Curt, now seated, starts
		on the acoustic guitar for {sweet} and {party} before we
		begin, ever so gently, to crank the set up.  It works
		like a dream.  Although the crowd looks disappointingly
		small in this big, beautiful club, every last one of
		them sucked into the sequence of songs, and the show
		goes like a dream.  &quot;That&quot;, I announce as we leave the
		stage, &quot;That&apos;s my band.&quot;  And it was.  Uli has us on
		the sambucca (he calls Jagermeister &quot;Leiberkleister&quot;
		- &quot;liver glue&quot;) and we have a massive dressing room party
		with an interesting bunch of people from Muenster.
		Cool.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb5.html">Day 6 : Bielefeld - <b>Kamp</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		It&apos;s a beautiful morning in Dortmund Beer City as we
		pull in to buy gas.  As the bus pulls away, a small and
		gentle green furry brontosaurus climbs onto the dash;
		it&apos;s Gerti, our new tour pet, a gentle soul with a fondness
		for yoghurt chocolate.  After a short drive we check
		into our beautiful hotel on the top of a high hill over
		the town and have another delicious lunch.  Tonight we
		have the largest crowd yet, partly because the promoter
		has worked really hard for us, and partly because dozens
		of people have followed us up from Dortmund.  The show
		is as good, or better, than last night, the party afterwards
		quite deranged, including the invention of a device called
		the Elektronische Handbefeuchter, an item which looks
		suspiciously like a kettle.  Perhaps you had to be there.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb6.html">Day 7 : Frankfurt -
		<b>Nachtleben</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		On the way to Frankfurt I realise - quite by chance -
		that tonight will be my hundredth show in Germany.  The
		club has a brilliant innovation, the backstage toaster.
		Not only does this enable you to have backstage toast,
		it also allows you to have a major backstage laugh as
		everybody steals Nick&apos;s toast as soon as it is done.
		We play a set that is not as fine as the last two, but
		remains well up to standard, which is just as well as
		the representatives of our Tokyo paymasters, Sony, are
		here to check out what sort of cak McGee has been sending
		them.  Actually, I recognise two of the Sony folk from
		earlier times, when they were just-fans, so the diplomacy
		thing isn&apos;t too demanding, after all.  We also do two
		very silly interviews for various US Forces networks.
		Tonight was the first show to sell out completely.  We&apos;d
		been a little concerned that the crowds of around 200
		were a bit on the thin side, but were deeply reassured
		when Uli told us about what had been happening to other,
		supposedly more &quot;happening&quot; British groups on this front.
		Cater, we were delighted to learn, had played more than
		one German show recently to a crowd of about thirty people!
		Oh JOY! Our German dates done, we say a lengthly and
		emotional farewell to Uli and clatter off into the night.
		</blockquote>
		Day 8 : Day off in Freiburg
		<blockquote>
		We get up, drink up (another unreal lunch, this time
		at Frankfurt&apos;s Cafe Palm) and point ourselves south.
		Our next date is in Geneva, but we figure life is less
		costly in Germany, so we spend the night (as we did last
		year) in the lovely old town of Freiburg, where we guzzle
		pizzas, watch &quot;Married With Children&quot; in German, and
		introduce Michael to the joys of Gluhwein.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb8.html">Day 9 : Geneva - <b>L&apos;Usine</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		On the Swiss border, Michael and I are incapable of avoiding
		the local cigarette called &quot;Marocaine&quot;.  On the assumption
		that they must have something good going for them we
		buy a pack of 200.  Eurobabble begins as we switch from
		German to French and narrowly avoid ordering horse for
		dinner.  The Usine is a huge place full of dodgy &quot;youth&quot;
		activities, including us.  We do one of those &quot;special&quot;
		radio interviews, with a large hairy man who wants to
		know if I have a stairway to heaven.  I tell him I take
		the elevator.  The show is competent, but a bit dull,
		but you could never say that of the Hotel Beau Site.
		Yeah, the site might be great (actually, it&apos;s on a huge
		grey stone boulevard that reminds us of Moscow) but the
		furnishings have to be seen to be believed.  And the
		drains have to be heard!  Curt and Nick convince me that
		the peculiar bakelite radios in the rooms are actually
		bugging devices, and within seconds we are IN MOSCOW,
		HELP US - WE&apos;RE IN MOSCOW!  Later Curt and Nick&apos;s room
		will fill up with teenage Canadian boys, on a sports
		tour.  I hide in my room.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb9.html">Day 10 : Fribourg -
		<b>Cafe Des Grandes Places</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		This was always going to be a weird one.  Rather than
		put up with a day off in a expensive Switzerland, we
		had accepted the offer of an &quot;unplugged&quot; show (no, don&apos;t
		laugh...)  What we hadn&apos;t been warned about was the owner
		of the club, a genial Moroccan called Samba (!), who
		acts as if he is angling for the job of Radio 1 DJ, or
		Ibiza party host.  In between trying to calm Samba down
		and get him to do his job, not ours, and avoiding slow
		poisoning from the world&apos;s most lard-infested &quot;mushroom
		pate&quot;, we do, in fact, assemble a rather splendid JBC
		Acoustic Soul Revue.  Curtis opened up, playing his own
		numbers and a couple of blues classics.  Michael then
		delivered half a dozen songs from his wonderful Spittle
		Rattle repertoire before the JBC took over, doing two
		band sets sandwiched around a bunch of solo numbers from
		the big fella.  All in all we delivered about three hours
		of non-stop music to an appreciative house.  Fashion
		note: Nick&apos;s shameless appropriation of Alpine styles
		were regarded as a major JBC sartorial breakthrough,
		and would later win him the Best Dressed Man Of The Tour
		award.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb10.html">Day 11 : Zurich -
		<b>Palais Extra</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		The drives in Switzerland are really short!  All the
		more time to enjoy our excellent hotel, although the
		Austrian TV did make me feel a bit homesick.  We succeeded
		in losing Curt before the soundcheck, and Michael during
		it.  On the other hand, we did find a fridge full of
		Czech Budweiser, which lifted the game a little, as you
		can imagine.  A wonderful dinner in an Italian restaurant
		staffed entirely by Pakistanis, and a fine show, perhaps
		the best we had delivered to date.  After the show we
		partied severely with some stray American gentlemen,
		the charming lady from Sony Zurich, who gave us all neat
		little Sony key-rings (corporate!) and showed me how
		to sing the Company Song (&quot;I made it up, fool...&quot;), a
		stray Polish jazz band and a couple of huge Italian chaps
		who appeared to be paid to finish off the food that we
		couldn&apos;t manage ourselves.  Bit of a night, son.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb11.html">Day 12 : Bern - <b>I.S.C.</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		Yet another short trip to beautiful Bern.  The house
		soundman plays Sting at the soundcheck until Curt explains
		his little mistake.  Today it becomes clear that Nick
		has somehow failed to collect his Sony key-ring.  This
		plunges him into a state of rage and despair, and enables
		us to take the piss ruthlessly for hours, not least because
		Kathie has actually got his key-ring on her!  We finally
		relent, and present him with his key-ring on stage, along
		with a hastily-contrived cardboard birthday cake.  The
		show is good, not great, the promoter is a young goth
		who has modeled his appearance on Coppola&apos;s Dracula,
		we are still having fun.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb12.html">Day 13 : Moudon -
		<b>Anciennes Prisons</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		At last!  The JBC got to jail!  Pausing only to offload
		a huge rider backlog of fruit on the bears of Bern, we
		make our way deep into the countryside to play this rich-but-draughty
		venue.  Michael and I skip dinner (we have eaten SOOOO
		much on this trip) and sit in the bar worrying about
		all the rich teenagers sitting around listening to what
		Curtis will later call &quot;acid crap&quot; or &quot;crap jazz&quot; depending
		on who&apos;s asking.  No need to worry - the show goes down
		really well, and we have a fine old time until the police
		show up.  Then we go home.
		</blockquote>
		Day 14 : Travel
		<blockquote>
		I wake up and leave my hotel room to find a large dog
		turd in the hotel corridor - this is A First.  Stopping
		for a lunch of curried banana near Geneva, we pass into
		France and drive through a blizzard before coming into
		the Rhone valley.  We pass a drunken night in Montelimar
		in the south of France.  It snows.
		</blockquote>
		Day 15 : Travel
		<blockquote>
		The worst weather of the tour, and it&apos;s on the Mediterranean
		coast! Michael bravely navigates the Love Bus through
		appalling storms and equally appalling French driving.
		Finally, things start to clear up as we approach Toulouse,
		where we check into the Hotel Guillaume Tell (a little
		Helvetic irony there, kids).  Kathie, Dooj, Michael and
		I find a curry house and dine extensively.  Curt and
		Nick fail to get any couscous.  Later that night, a seedy-looking
		individual appears at Nick&apos;s door, asking if he has anything
		wict which he can wipe his needles!
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb15.html">Day 16 : Toulouse -
		<b>Le Bikini</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		I get downstairs to find the JBC in a state of high excitement.
		Apparently the old lady in charge of the breakfast cafe
		is stone deaf, and is delivering stuff entirely at random:
		&quot;Is it on the trolley?&quot; is the rallying call.  A lazy
		day, wherein we remove to the Hotel Ibis, then off to
		the show.  Le Bikini is a huge, spanish-style discotheque.
		Tomorrow Wet Wet Wet are playing here; &quot;Ah, but that
		is not my promotion&quot;, says the promoter and club-owner,
		&quot;I prefer having you.&quot;  Judging by the cartoons on the
		dressing room wall, he may not be talking about the concert.
		You can tell we&apos;re near Spain from the amount of free
		liquor that we are supposed to consume before dinner.
		<p />
		Michael opens the show with a Spittle Rattle set, which
		is well received by a small but perfectly formed audience.
		We go on and deliver a good set and a lot of free fruit
		from the rider.  There may not be very many people here
		(and such a big room!), but they are, without exception,
		well into what we are doing, so we count the show a success
		and have a big old party with The French.  Much bus-surfing
		in the hotel car park, then bed.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb16.html">Day 17 : Clermont-Ferrand -
		<b>Club 3000</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		The drive to Clermont-Ferrand is long and winding, over
		many hills.  At a place called Cahors Kathie saves us
		from certain death on the road when a moronic Frenchman
		tries to pull onto a narrow road that is already full
		of vehicles.  Leaving the miscreant to think over the
		consequences of his actions in a ditch by the side of
		road, the Love Bus speeds on.  The drive goes on forever,
		enlivened only by Nick&apos;s asking the driver if she was
		still awake.  Things start to look up when, on arrival
		in Clermont, we are taken to play an acoustic set in
		a record store called &quot;Spliff&quot;!  We then get taken to
		a Pakistani restaurant of utter brilliance.  Its name
		is Kalash - you have to eat there.  Stuffed full of curry
		we play a rockin&apos; set to a stuffed club, and are duly
		loved.  After the show there is a disco that was clearly
		devised soley for the benefit of Mr Dooj, who bestrode
		the dance floor like a glam-rock colossus.  After several
		hours of partying we became aware that the club has filled
		up with some of the most squalid junkies we&apos;ve ever seen,
		so we split.  We have already received our invitation
		to return for a festival later in the year.
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb17.html">Day 18 : Paris - <b>Arapaho</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		<Link href="https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/images/paris.jpg">
			<Image className="float-right m-3" width={250} height={250} alt="[image]"
			src="https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/images/paris.jpg" /></Link>
		{loony} has been busy; as
		soon as we arrive in the venue he is on the phone: &quot;I&apos;ve
		made you a backdrop - can you pick it up?&quot;  It&apos;s huge,
		and covered in penguins.  We&apos;d hoped to have Michael
		open again here, but unfortunately a dirty hippy youth
		had already been booked to do his Kurt Cobain impressions.
		Nonetheless, the JBC show is a monster, the best Paris
		for years.  The Love Bus throws an after-gig tantrum,
		but is soon re-animated.  Perhaps an hour later we finally
		find the hotel - very nice, but a little discreet, non?
		<p className="clear_float" />
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb18.html">Day 19 : Dordrecht -
		<b>Odd Balls</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		Paris was, officially, the last date of the tour, but
		we were having too much fun to stop there, so we&apos;d asked
		Marthy to sort us out a couple of little bar concerts
		in Holland.  This one was notable for three things: we
		finally found some food in Holland (very nice, too!);
		the audience, when we began, was 80% black; and Curtis,
		having delivered a wildly stoned opening set, managed
		a more than respectable impersonation of Michael Schenker
		during {zombie}.  We played for hours and hours, doing
		covers that included the {space}&apos;s <i>Walking With Jesus</i>
		and the best-ever version of {punks}.  It all went down
		very well, so once again we partied hard.  So hard, in
		fact, that I think it rather alarmed our Dutch hosts.
		I don&apos;t think they believed we had it in us.  Well, now they know!
		</blockquote>
		<Link href="/gigs/1994/Feb19.html">Day 20 : Breda -
		<b>Zinetti</b></Link>
		<blockquote>
		After a long sleep we drive the 30-odd kilometers to
		Breda and join Marthy and his band, The Four One And
		Onlies, at their tiny but beautifully-decorated studio.
		They are recording a version of {richman}&apos;s
		<i>UFO Man</i> for some dubious &quot;tribute album&quot;, so we
		join in with handclaps and backing vocals.  We have some
		beers.  Those that are interested in this kind of thing
		are advised to look for the LP on Alienor Records, an
		independent out of Bordeaux{FR}, in the near future.
		<p />
		In the evening, after an introduction to the World Of
		Roti (tasty!), we descend on what is fast becoming the
		JBC&apos;s Euro-base, <b>Zinetti</b>.  Establishing ourselves
		on the balcony (well, we hadn&apos;t played up there before)
		we play two lengthly acoustic sets to a full house.  For
		the last time Curt delivers his ragga-skinhead rap on
		{cvb}&apos;s wonderful tune, and that is that.  Back
		to Marthy&apos;s to watch The Monks on ancient euro-videos, then bed.
		</blockquote>
		Day 21 : Travel
		<blockquote>
		Catch the boat, sort out the money, do the tour awards,
		drive home, got to bed for ever.
