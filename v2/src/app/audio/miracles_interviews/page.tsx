		The late Pat Fish in conversation with me on 5th October 2019.
		<p />Much of this would become the &apos;Fishcotheque&apos; chapter of &apos;Miracles and Wonders&apos;, the book Pat and I wrote, which I finished and published after he shuffled off on 5th October 2021.  
		<p />
		It was a lovely, if emotional day.  We ate bagels and smoked cheese at my house, watched the Tottenham game (they lost 3-0 to Brighton), aborted an intended trip to Uppingham, before arriving at the Plough, Shutlanger. 
		<p />After the recording we went on a little pub crawl, witnessed a skein of geese fly noisily overhead (&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen that before&quot;, said Pat), and consumed a takeaway back at Fishy Mansions.

Testing. Testing. Hola. Hola. We're for forums.

Yeah. Yeah. All good. Yeah. So I'm The ram.

The ram. The goat. The goat. Yeah. It wasn't uncle Dave's goat.

It was uncle Dave's pub at the time. He had this place, and, uncle Dave, like me, he likes a bit of spliff. And he had a quarter lying around his flat upstairs at the pub. And he must have grabbed it and put it down in the wrong place. But this goat that was residing temporarily here in this yard ate the quarter.

Dave, of course, was furious with the goat, but he did he you know, before he could get around to organizing any kind of chastisement for the goat, The goat freaked out having eaten a quarter of hash and started butting the wall of that shed repeatedly. And Dave decided, well, it's beating itself up. I don't need to take any further action. So today, we are going to bridge eighty six to eighty eight tour. Whilst we're in this pub, we have to talk about living in a village.

Kit. But, we also need to talk about because we didn't we didn't touch on the first US and Canadian gigs of '86. No. I mean, that was an interesting time. One of the last gigs we did before America was a massive, massive thing in Naples.

It was the Italian young communist's national knees up. And I don't know if you're familiar with the Bay Of Naples, but on the Bay Of Naples is an enormous seafront. And that was absolutely heaving with people. There are, I would say, at least 20,000 people now. And, we had to go and play at this lot.

And it went very well. It was a lovely evening. But at some point in the evening, I was being interviewed by this, keen young Italian socialist, and he goes, and and when is your next where is your next concert? And I found myself compelled to tell him that it was in New Jersey. I felt like a right klutz.

Yeah. It was it was mad because that was the '86, of course. And right out on the horizon at the edge of the bay, you could see the bloody great American warship from which the planes were taking off to murder children in Libya. And how did you feel when your first week was here in America? Well, you know, we were all good good little Eurocommists as our Italian adventure rather suggests, and our initial reaction on landing in America was to do a lot of bristling.

But we landed in New York, which made it kinda easier because, of course, you know, you get that drive in from JFK, and you sit there looking at it, and you go, New York City just like I pictured it. And you get to do all that. And, of course, you know, it's like Velvet Underground City and Yeah. Greenwich Village City. So, like, you're kind of cool.

You're kind of interested. And the very first night that we were there, of all the things to be happening around the corner, Rolo's mob were playing. So we went to see them and hung out with them. Remember coming back about four, five in the morning, heading for the hotel. We got me, Rolo, and Frank.

He's bass player, Frank de Freres. And, there's a dude sort of lurking in a in a dark dark sort of corner going, hey. Hey, bro. Bro, that guy, what you need? Giving all this out.

And Frank, being Frank from this terribly sort of well brought up artistic family, Frank goes toddling over. Say, really? What do you do? And we're going, Francis. It's, yeah.

It so there was that. And then the first gig we did was in a place called Maxwell's in Hoboken, which is just over the water, so it's New Jersey. And then the next gig we did was in a place called the Cat Club on the Lower East Side. Oh, yes. So we have your picture taken with you, Your guitar's over your shoulder.

That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alastair and Robin had come from the Sound Sky.

They'd come out to see some gigs out on the East Coast. And, yeah, the Cat Club was, like, at one end of the street, and at the other end of street, there was a theater where Lou Reed was playing the same night. So the fact that anyone turned up was kind of a delight to us. And when we ended up doing sweet Jane for an encore, knowing that he was probably doing exactly the same thing 300 yards up the street, that was quite a buzz. So the crowds were quite decent then?

Well, we I mean, it doesn't take a lot to sell out Maxwell's. It's not that big a place. Couple of 100. You know? But when we hit New York, it was in the middle of this thing called CMJ conference.

And this is basically every last alternative music twat in the nation descends upon New York City. So it was impossible to move around the cat club without someone leaping in your way and going, hi. I'm Jodie from Colorado. Can you give me a station ID? I'm sorry.

A station what? What do you want? Do you want my ticket? You know? You have to say KXPW Colorado with the alternative sound.

I have to say what? And, you know, by the time we've got that far into the conversation, there's three others going, hey. Hey. Hey. I'm Joanie from XPWQ.

And it just never stops. It was it was impossible to move around. Fortunately, we ran into some girls that we knew from New York who'd met us in London, and they kind of became our small, snappy protectors. One of whom I later married briefly. And, yeah.

So it was it was a mad start, and it took us two or three days to get our heads around it at all. We couldn't understand why there was only Heineken to drink and things like that. And, I can remember we got as far as Boston, Massachusetts, and, oh god. The Cape Cod incident. We're gonna have to do the I mean, I don't know.

Look. I mean, what are we doing here? We're not doing a biography, are we? We're trying to do the work rather. Yeah.

Nonetheless, I do feel I should tell the Cape Cod incident. If it's useful connecting material. I don't know. I don't know. It's just cultural context, I suppose.

But we had a day off just before Boston, Massachusetts. And there's a fellow called Eric Lindgren, who's on the music scene out that way, who Dave Barkanew. And, Eric had arranged for us to stay. I think it must have been his grandmother's house rather than just his mom. Given the age we were, it must have been his grandma.

This old lady right out on Cape Cod with a house, like, 20 yards from the sea. Just, you know, no fences or anything. Just a house by the road, a porch, a beach. I mean, we got to this place not knowing what was going on and being very sort of sweetly eyed and suspicious. And, we were greeted by missus Lindgren with incredible hospitality and kindness.

She let us sit there in our house and smoke dope and drink beer. And the Avengers was on TV, and we were happy and not sad. The next morning, we awoke. It was a beautiful summer stay on Cape Cod down by the beach. Owen and I went into the kitchen, and there was old grandma Lindgren.

And from the freezer, she pulls an enormous lobster. We pay this no mind. We figure that this thing, you know, it's just a lobster from the fridge. What she then does is she puts it in the sink and starts running water on it. And to our utter horror, the thing starts to move.

But it can't do too much moving because its claws have been taped shut. And it's a big old thing, and it's waking up, and we're sort of just being quietly horrified. And she goes, here's my birthday lunch. And like this old lady, she's gotta be, like, 82 if she's a date, right, and it's her birthday. Here's my birthday lunch.

I reckon he could be 25 years old. 25 years old. You gotta understand as we drove out to this place, every 100 yards, there's a lobster shack. This place is lobster Auschwitz. Just a constant lobster holocaust going on.

Right? And somehow, this wily old so and so has managed to reach the age of 25 years old only to be caught by grandma Lindgren and queued up for lunch. So she goes pottering off. Lobster sits there twitching in the old sink. And Owen and I are mortified.

And we go running out onto the front porch where Max is sitting with the journalist guys. And we report the situation, and everyone's feeling very, very uncomfortable. And, of course, we start working out. It's like, you know, all you've gotta do she's an old lady. All you've gotta do is pick him up and run 20 yards to the beach and let him go.

That's all we've gotta do. But she's been so nice to us, and it's her birthday lunch. What are we gonna do? What's the contract? Mental anguish.

In the end, we left him to his fate. We thought, well, she better have her lunch. And, jumping over the eighty six tour of The US and Canada fairly quickly because we're gonna move on to the Well, we killed it. We killed it. We had no we had no idea.

I mean, you know, three months before we went, we'd never dreamed we'd be playing America. We got there, and this CMJ thing was on. And CMJ was one of three alternative charts they used to have. And on that, we were number two behind Sonic Youth. On another chart at the same time, of the same type, we were number two behind The Ramones.

And no one had told us the damn thing. So we walked into this kind of, you know, there were just kids everywhere. Loads of the gigs sold out. Lots of radio radio played by then. You know?

College radio play. Lot of college radio play. Tiny bit of commercial as well. And then it got worse. Then we got into Canada, and no one had told us, but we were on a major label.

And so the Mercury machine went into effect, which meant that I was handed sheets of paper that began with the words nine and AM, you know, so I could sit in my hotel bed and talk to the Winnipeg supergrass or whatever. That was pretty dire. And you've told us a bit about Canada before. Maybe later tours where, where, you know, the the guitar case incident what's in the guitar case? Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

The, yes. The great airport event. Yeah. That was enough. Which was probably a tour or two late.

Yeah. And then Two or three tours later, I think. And then back to back to Europe continuing to gig. In '86, you played over a 100, I think. Yeah.

I mean, the big thing that happened between America and Europe was that we, we finally sort of shared Graham. There was a moment in the middle of the American tour in Detroit where Owen and I were sitting, some hotel somewhere, and we're talking about the state of Graham. And Owen said, you know, I feel I know him less well now than when he joined the band. And, yeah, the guy just had some really weird coping strategies for touring. You told us about bathrooms.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was the the that, you know, that actually becomes a genuine practical nightmare when you're living on the road.

And I I probably told you about Ida's sardian moment where he decided that the way he would express this was by moving him to Graham. So by the end of the tour, we were pretty much Max, Noane, and I pretty much resolved that, you know, Graham needed something needed to be done. And in fact, in the last desperate days in LA while we were piling around being hostile to everything that came near us, Graham came shuffling up to me and said, I think I think I'm going to leave the group. And I thought, oh, well, saves me a job then. Because I wasn't looking for I'd you know, I'd They had a slight inkling by then.

I'm not into the business of sacking people. No. No. No. No.

No. I mean, give you some idea, right, of how out of touch Graham is with reality. Many, many, many, many, many years later, I bumped into him in the road mender. It's probably about 2000 and something. And he says to me, Pat.

I said, Graham. He said, Pat, sex and travel, the album title. Yes, Graham. Yes. That's like sex and travel.

It's like, fuck off, isn't it? Yes, Graham. So like the penny dropped. Okay. Yeah.

And then he goes on to say, so, like, you were, like, telling Dave Jade to fuck off. Subject places, palm, over face, and acts as though he's lost the will to live. Yeah. Unbelievable. So you're, like, telling Dave to fuck off then?

Just no connection with the facts at all. He's probably voting for Boris Johnson there. And then, I wonder, at some point during autumn eighty six, Max disappears for fourteen years. Oh, good. Oh, good.

But we we haven't we haven't got to that yet. We haven't even replaced Graham yet. And that's the real problem. Yes. In the in the methodology of it, things started to go wrong in the dressing room.

Graham went. We didn't quite know what to do about that. We didn't know who to get, but we knew we got a whopping great big, European tour coming. Alex Green had returned from living in Sweden, so we took him on to play sax. And in the end, we decided to go for a bloke who Max probably knew best.

We all knew him a little bit from Oxford. A guy called Richard Lawn, who was really a guitar player, but he could play a bit of bass. So we got him in. And he was a disruptive influence in the dressing room. He's very and he's tremendously able guy, tremendously good player, but he had that sort of upper middle class confidence and self assurance that can really grate when you're all trying to pull together.

And, yeah, he he just used to drive me to levels of irritation. And I think Max got irritated at my being irritated. We weren't particularly irritated with each other. But, by then, he was working up he used to sit he used to work on, that song My Other Life and a couple of the other earlier solo album songs. He was his head was there already on that autumn tour.

He was like he got the chance to do the solo record, and he was really starting to think about it. And I really needed him more to be there for me so that I could deal with these two new recruits. One of him wasn't really any trouble at all, bless. You know, Alex. I mean, he's he's he was made to be in that band for a while.

That's, the Richard question. Yeah. Yeah. He annoyed me. And, really, all that famous blow up with me and Max that everyone talks about, which wasn't really that big a deal, It was, as far as I remember it, all the animosity that evening really started stemming from the activities of Richard the night before.

But, I mean, this isn't this isn't on the record stuff, really. No. K. So but it wasn't some Gallagher Brothers violent buster? We sat there the next morning.

Him and me, we'd be we sort of went off to have a little fucking conference. You know? And we sat in this bar in Switzerland together. And it's like, so are you off then? Yeah.

I'm gonna get the train back. Alrighty. You'll be alright. Yeah. I know.

Yeah. Stupid. Yeah. And then he goes, well, at least it didn't turn violent. I went, yeah.

And we dropped him at the railway station, and we set off, and everyone was a little bit in shock. At least it didn't turn violent. That's when I remembered the table. The table with about a 130 glasses and bottles on it being thrown at me. But we don't like to talk about it in for the public because they just scurrilous.

But I have in my investigations, you can see it on the encyclopedic abc.com. Yeah. Zurich 11/27/1986. Yeah. Oh.

Is that Yeah. The next gig, Schaffhausen, November 28. Mhmm. He's absent. He's just gone.

Yeah. He's just gone. Yeah. He got he got on the train. You're playing the gig the next night without without guitar.

Yeah. Fortunately, we had Alex. And, fortunately, by then, I'd learned to play guitar a little bit. So, I've actually I certainly had a bootleg of a gig in Vienna a couple of nights after the boy went. We're we're sounding great.

I mean, there was a a shift in the sound. It wasn't quite so hard, but it was, yeah, it was alright. And we went on. We did Austria and a bunch of Italian dates and then a couple of German dates, and then we came home. And then almost about two days later, we were straight out to Spain.

And, then I got a flu. Is this the year you end up in New York in a basement before you're then called out for the eighty seven tour with Alex? Well, that's right. Went home for Christmas. Obviously, I had quite a fair bit of money in my pocket at that point.

And, so I thought I'll go and see that girl in New York, which I duly did. So I was just sitting in a basement in Queens passing the time, and Mike Inc phones me up and goes, you know you're supposed to be in Norway in four days, don't you? I'm like, no. You know I've got no band, don't you? No.

So, yeah, Alex and I just set off and played those dates. Just the two of us. And then, well, what happened on that string of dates, of course, was that we got as far as Paris. And that was the night that they made us sing La Mer over and over and over again. Yeah.

You must know. Yeah. And came off, came up the stairs into the dressing room, and there was McGee. Then I've gone to sign you. I was like, you what?

Your contract's up with glass. I hadn't even noticed. What's when when was this? What's the date? It would've been February.

So he's chasing you? Who's chasing me? McGee. Can I help you? To a degree, it's after you.

Yeah. Yeah. He said a very flattering thing. He said he wanted, he'd always wanted three artists for the label. One was, Lawrence at Felt, one was Julian Cope, and one was me.

And he said, well, two out of three ain't bad. But, you know, if ever if ever proof was required that Alan Magee just spends his time pursuing nutters and sociopaths, I mean, it's right there, isn't it? And then you sort of have to start to assemble a band, but you're still playing gigs. And and gig, Kizzy, I think, turns up first gig. Kizz turns up straight away because, like, he used to In the '87, I spotted the the first gig.

I thought he appears in Sheffield Uni. Oh, was that Super Cosmic Joy? These were organized by two geezers, one called Zig and one called Horton Jupiter. These days, Horton Jupiter is, sort of anarchist chef and DJ in South London. And Zig is Mark Webber, the other guitar player in Pulp.

In those days, they were both about 16. They had sort of weird matching off art anoraks. And they used to organize these gigs. They'd phone up Sonic, and they go, Sonic, Sonic, Jason says you're gonna play our gig. And then very quickly, they'd phone up Jason and go, Jason, Jason, Sonic says you're gonna play our gig.

Then they'd phoned me up and say, Pat, Pat, Spaceman three are doing this gig. And cheeky little songs, they weren't even old enough to get into their own promotions. You know? But they used to, like, play us off against each other. And next thing you know, they've got, like, half a dozen bands assembled.

That's where I first ran into Inspiral Carpets. They were always on first at these things. Funny little band from Rochdale. You know? Him him with the hair, we used to call it.

So, you know, I've probably actually spent time around Noel Gallagher to at that point when he was rode in for him, of course, but didn't know it at the time. They're just back in Northern Monkees. And, yeah, that very first gig with me at Sheffield, it was just me and KISS, and we went on and we started with the song, and playing away. And, this is a bit where KISS gets to have a bit of a guitar solo, and it was the strangest sounding thing. It was like there was like there was like some kind of limiter on the guitar or something really strange.

There was no sustain on it at all. And we got to the end of the first number, and he realized he'd been playing the guitar with the plectrum stuck in between the strings to wait, you know, like, where you put them just to keep them there. And, yeah, the silly sort of just picked up the guitar and started playing it with the pick still wedged under the strings. The start of an illustrious career. And, and O'Keefe and Maureen sort of arrived by the '87?

Yeah. Lawrence arrived initially. We answered an ad in the Melody Maker, a sort of stupid surrealist box ad for a rhythm section. Mhmm. And Lawrence arrived with a fellow called Budge who had, like, this incredibly expensive smart car and was really sort of, like, rugged type.

Righty ho. Yes. Let's play the drums. And he was quite a nice chap, but he was like, he clearly had far too good a job to be able to join a professional rock and roll band. You know?

It was just obvious from the car and everything. So he lasted fucking five minutes really. Poor old Budge. And then yeah. Yes.

Then would be Mulraney. And he was recommended by Alan and Dick, Dick Green. And I'd I remember Paul's told me since that Dick used to bang on at him. Oh, you're gonna love them. You're gonna love them.

They got a song about chicken. They're mental. And Paul's like, oh, I don't know about all this. But pretty much from day one, it was clear that Mulraney and me were gonna get on. Yeah.

What a geyser. What a man. Were there sort of terms to the creation signing, or is it a gentleman's handshake? Was that proper legal stuff? What's the paperwork going on?

Expectations. I think I mean, possibly part of a new order, But I think I probably had the last handshake deal in history. Because round about '92 when Sony got involved, suddenly everyone went around, and everyone was being forced to sign new contracts, you know, for Sony's sake. And, I remember the scream wriggling like mad. They didn't they didn't wanna do that because they'd always been on a handshake as well.

But, of course, they were worth too much money, so they got nailed to a contract of some kind. But somehow, I think simply by just not being around, I never got to sign any paper, which meant, of course, that when creation fell over, there was really nothing to stop me claiming all that back catalog, which, of course, I have now done and sold it to fire for money. So, you know, that was always that was always a great a great thing for me was that there's no paperwork, no paper trail on any of that. It's just you know? And all those records, it's not like I'm robbing anyone.

All those records made their money back and the rest. So, you know, they are just mine. And the, the lapse from blocks was there. It was Dave. Is there a sort of forced separation from No.

I wasn't crazy about it, but, I mean, I obviously, I went and talked after my gear turned up and after I got back from tour, obviously, I went and talked to Dave about this. But from where I was sitting, it looked like creation was gonna be a much better deal just in terms of, like, getting attention and credibility. The interesting You've been lifted, Jamie Vardy liked, haven't you all? Was there a sense of that? Sort of rise rising a division or two?

What was it? That was that was that was how we perceived it from where we were, but gotta bear in mind that we live in England. And what what became apparent quite quickly was that although Dave Barker was just a bloke with a telephone, he was actually much better at foreign markets than creation were. Yeah. They look like pop stars to us because they're always in the English press.

But in terms of actually doing things on the ground in foreign countries, they weren't actually that well equipped to do that. Again, there was only a couple of them. You know, I mean, the when I signed, there was Alan and Dick. And after a while, there was Ed Ball. And Jeff Barrett would help out with the press, and Emma would help him.

Emma, who ended up in Lush, Emma Anderson. But that was it. That was the entire staff of the operation. And, like, really, there were only three or three full ones, Alan, Dick, and Ed. Cue loads of juvenile jokes.

Matt, Alan, Dick, Ed. And then we get into '88 and, and recording fish fish kitec. I'm not sure what, what month. Well, fish kitec was done over the '87. Oh, was it?

Yeah. You see, we didn't we didn't have the rhythm section at that point. We didn't get Mulraney until December '87. I can remember the rehearsal stand in Greenwich. When I see these guys on the on the credits, Greenwood Goulding and Dave Moore Yeah.

The Weather Prophets. Weather Prophets Rhythm section. We were thrilled to get them. There was a lot of doubt about that because there's a lot of maneuvering going on. Alan had come up with this sort of weird crossover label called Elevation.

He did a single for Edwin Collins on it, and it was his plan to put The Scream on it and The Weather Prophets. And the idea was that this would kind of bridge between creation and the majors. I think there was major money behind it. It was one of these proto fake indie labels. You know?

But it all went tits up. It didn't really work. The Edwin Collins record stiffed. The weather profits stiffed. And you see, as long as the as long as the profits were on this elevation label I think there's Warners who were involved or someone like that.

As long as they were on this label, we couldn't say who they were. We could use them on the record, but they had to be secret. We were gonna credit them as Bang and Olafsson, as a matter of fact. But by the time the record was done and cut and mastered, the whole elevation thing had collapsed and fallen through. And so we can actually call them by their names, which was nice because they're lovely blokes and lovely players.

So, yeah, we made the majority of the record with them. Lawrence is on one track, and there's a couple of other chaps who played for about ten minutes in the '87. They're on Lot 49. It's quite good for them, actually, because, like, that's about the only thing they got recorded with us. And, it's actually been one of the more popular songs, so they can sort of feel they there was some point getting involved.

You know? And, tell me about Alaska Studios, Waterloo. Alaska. Before we get into the song. Yeah.

Well, Alaska is the studio of Pat Collier, who was in the vibrators. And there's rehearsal rooms and a couple of recording studios. It's under the arches down by Waterloo, as you probably know. It's funky. It's down and dirty.

And after Distress, it felt like the perfect place to go and make the record that I actually wanted to make that had some sort of, like, you know, a bit of amplifier noise on it. Bit of fucking. And so yeah. And it was cheap. And it came with O'Higgins.

You know, we just walked in, and there he was, sitting there looking like Bob Geldof eating his vegans, whatever that stuff is. He just always had this enormous Tupperware bowl of just, like, salad weird salad y stuff. Fruit falafel, aren't they? In which he'd scoop up by the handful while he was working. Much disconcerting.

And he looked and sounded just like Geldof. Let me get you a pint of that, whatever it was. Oh, the union. Yes, please. 44.

Do you wanna stop that guy or We'll keep it running. Okay. Because that'll give I'll give Maureen a break in the middle. Maureen. Maureen.

Maureen. Maureen. Get some Maureen down here all the time. Don't leave my my work laptop unlocked in the pub garden. Never mind.

I survived. I should have locked it. That's terribly bad, you know, civil service etiquette, leaving your machine unlocked. Been drummed into me over the years. You got you got a lovely little, Dortmund Union glass there as well.

Ah. Which prompts, you know Oh, happiness. And it will take a little picture of you. Maybe a proper there Hopiness. Hopiness.

I mean, this phone is just ridiculous. Hang on a minute. That's two phones. Yeah. That's Ethan's old phone Uh-huh.

That I use for recording. I see your two phones. And I have my antique. Yeah. That's a poor picture of you, but it's Gary's picture of the beer.

That's amazing. You're look looking, what's the word, lovingly. So, thinking about the record and what's on. Shrisek. There's a lot of mention of buses.

Because are you so is and and and a mention of so I think Next Move Sideways is a mention of there's reference, I think, to the to some Next move sideways is a howl of protest. Against the next move forward. Mhmm. Yes. Oh, that was some sort of That was their nonsense they were talking at the time.

You have to understand that when I was living here, and by 8788, I was living here, in order to go anywhere, I had to pick up my guitar and my amplifier or my suitcase or all three. And I had to walk a mile and a half over a hill in that direction until I met up with the a 43. And at the end of that street that came out on the A 43, on the other side of the road was the bus stop. I then take the bus into Northampton. I then get on a train to London.

I then get a tube train up to Mackenzie Road, and then I would be taken care of. So one day, I set out to do this in '87, and I arrived at the bus stop to find that there was no bus stop. It had been dug up. I was therefore obliged to walk another mile and a half along the A 43 as far as Tifield, where I stood outside the bad lads home until a bus finally came and took me where I wanted to go. Well, I wasn't having that.

Is a new is is a new road being built somewhere? Yeah. It was when they were building the, you know, what now passes for the Oxford Road. Yeah. Yeah.

Basically, it's it's like the second verse says. It's like they've got their pretty little toaster with all their nice little old buildings and the rest of it, and they don't want scum like us getting in there. So they they they root us around. Yeah. So, I mean, that's certainly the first two verses.

So that are pretty much just a literal description of what the hell is going on. And as for the old Romanian saying that was kids tiptoeing through the road manager's living room sometime in the middle of the '87, we'd we'd become so skinned at this point that because, you know, we hadn't done any work. We'd become so skinned that we'd become stuck at the tour manager's house in Wandsworth. We couldn't get out. We didn't have enough money to get back to an end.

And, yeah, in the middle of that sometime, I I sort of half half woke up in the middle of the night, and I just saw kids shuffling past, carrying a chessboard in the middle of the night. Smoking on the bridge like a tourist by the houses of Harlem? Well, third verse, things get a little bit inside out, don't they? Like, some songs sound like they're about girls, but they're not. And other songs sound about there's sound like they're about politics, but they sound out to be about girls.

Having a very emotional day one way or another. That's lovely. Yeah. So that's, yeah, it all goes gets turned a bit inside out. She was I mean, she's actually there in the second chorus.

What do you do when potential is your favorite word? You know, I was still a young man in those days. I was just pushing 30. And one thing that you used to hear a lot of in the eighties, if you were youngish, was people using this word, potential. I don't know what the equivalent would be now.

Brexit, perhaps. Anyway, you still have much the same feelings in me as Brexit. You know, the answer the answer to this whole potential nonsense that the English middle classes go whinging on about all day long. Two words, Peter and Cook. He's gone to his potential.

He had his own nightclub and his own magazine by the time he was 25. Where was he supposed to go? He'd done it all, mate. He was done with you. He was done with you.

You could not follow him. You fill me with inertia. Yeah. I think I should've shown you another sort of book I picked up probably at a charity sale somewhere with the the complete Pete and Doug sort of scripts, I think. I have it.

Yeah. I have it. Yeah. No. I I'm I'm very divisive about this.

I'm very pro cook and cannot even stand the thought of Dudley Moore. But at some point, there's no separating the two. Yeah. I suppose. I'd like to strike a happy medium.

Well, I suppose, it's worth saying that, you know, the the whole album sounds different because there's no maps on it. Oh, for sure. Yeah. And and he and he, I think I read somewhere, will openly sort of say that some of your best stuff is during the fourteen year hiatus. You know?

I don't think it was as long as fourteen years. Eighty six. So you knew We were we were playing again by '91. Oh, really? Okay.

Yeah. I mean, you know, this is the this is the thing. When you not recording again until February. Oh, we didn't record again for a long time, but that was just circumstance, you know, like, get the opportunity to record. But it was January 1990 while we were making Cult of the Basement.

He invited me to his birthday party down in London. And I thought, oh, there's a turn up. So I went I took the night off, went down. And, yeah, we ended up doing some playing at the party that night. So that's only, like, four years.

And, like, by the mid nineties, we were doing things. There was this little bar in Northampton that Imaj used to have called Slurps. Yeah. I think he saw you at Slurps. Yeah.

Right? Yeah. He was awful. He when I I saw him there. Quite possibly.

Yeah. But, yeah, he used to come up and do things there sometimes. And, yeah, by '96, we were like even though you know, the band broke up in '95. And then by the end of '96, the band was kinda like him and me again. It was all very doesn't doesn't make any sense.

Never did. Oh, the song Out of Touch? Out of Touch is Oh, before oh, shoot. Before we get on to that, I just wanted to mention the the the laugh at the start of next move sideways. Nice nice to start another with a laugh, I thought.

I like it. It was such a nice cackle that I thought I'll just leave it there. Yeah. I like little details like that. So, you know, on on records, like, sometimes at the end of a song, you might hear the drum stool move as he gets up or something like that.

You know, it's it's just lets you know that it was made by people and not by a pack of robots working as a committee. Out of touch then. Sorry. Out of touch. Perfect Disaster had a guitar player called Danny Cross or sexy Daniel Cross as I used to call him.

And he introduced me to a very simple game. And you take your notebook, and you fold the page in half. But before you do, you make some sort of cross lines all the way down the page, then you fold it in half. And you take one side of that paper and you just write random words down. Bell.

Hopeless. Fish. Sad. Breakfast. Toilet.

Arthritis. You fold it over so that your mate can't see and you hand it to him and he writes down horse, biscuit, Jennifer, all the way down. And then you open it up and you see what you've got. And I would estimate that about 60% of the lyrics on Out of Touch were built using the JBC lyric generator. Milk bohemian, devious plant.

Oh, and here's Fishy to come up with the rhyme. I'm sure he'd like to take his place in history, but everybody knows assures me he can't. But I don't know. I've been out of touch. I just dropped by to say hello.

It's talking about having a life that goes work work work work work work work work and then 1997. Off the edge of a cliff almost. Well, it wasn't off the edge of a cliff. It was just like, what are we gonna do now? And, you know, what's going on out there?

Because you gotta bear in mind, I wasn't living in London at this point. I was living right here that summer, you know, with a bewildered girl from the Lower East Side. I said to her, I said, welcome to the British Midwest. So, yeah, out of touch is about that, really. Kinda self evident.

But David Bowie did some sort of, had had some sort of, lyric generator like that. He he followed the Burrows cut ups technique. Yeah. Yeah. Cut up.

Yeah. And, I mean, we've we've done that too. I mean, I don't I don't think there's anyone who's ever heard of those techniques who hasn't tried them out. You know? And we later on, we got into using oblique strategies quite a lot.

Yeah. You're good. Yeah. But, yeah, the old lyric generator actually is is quite good fun. And there was an interesting development in 2015 where we I was showing you know, to the quartet, I was showing them this.

We were out on on tour in France, and, Graham's boy, Leighton, had come out with us. Lovely chap. And Leighton got unbelievably taken with this game. He really he really took a shine to it. And Leighton, it was, who introduced the triple fold.

So suddenly, you could get three words assembled at random. And pretty much the first time we tried this, we unfolded the page, and one of the results we got was wet nurse world. And this delighted Leighton so much. For about twenty four hours, he cackled about Wet Nurse World. That sounds like a dodgy magazine.

Doesn't it, though? Get It Wrong. Is that about infidelity? Is that just about infidelity? Well, I mean, Get It Wrong is basically a very obvious joke.

I think when Alex and I were touring in '87, we were playing a lot of because we'd kind of done the hip places before Christmas with the band. And, like, the the places that we were doing in early eighty seven just as a duo were largely places that hadn't quite caught on yet, so they weren't that hip. So you'd quite often find ourselves late at night in these, like, French nightclubs where the music was really a little bit anodyne or a little bit sort of safe. You know? And I think that is how poor old Marvin got it in the neck for that.

I think the idea is just to sort of, like, parody parody the, like, let's have a shag songs, which I've never really liked. But oddly enough, given the state of my personal life at that stage of the game, there are lines in that that are actually sort of quite considered. Alright. So if any jealousy is only messed up pride, it only twists you up inside, we don't need it. We don't feel it.

So and bear in mind, this is all before I got married. This is all before I was, like, involved in any of that. So oddly enough, although it's quite it's just it's, you know, it's a poor excuse for a song, basically. But I really enjoyed doing it, and I enjoyed doing the singing on it because, you know, I do actually love soul music, and it was kind of fun to do that Marvin thing with loads and loads of the same voice going around all bouncing off each other. I enjoyed doing that.

And I really I really enjoy, Bitchy and Ritchie. You know? That That's one of those lines. Yeah. Been back couldn't have been done before or since.

Well, it's just one of those it's one of those ones where you sort of it pops into your head and you you can't do that. And the trouble with me is whenever I say to myself, you can't do that, I go, oh, yes. I bloody can, and probably write it down with a biro. And a lot of, Fishketak was written in isolation just up the hill in Schuttlanger in a tiny, tiny room with a cassette player. And there was a lot of that, you can't do that.

Yes. I can. And there was also a lot of drinking because, of course, we'd had, like, two years of, like, free drink every night. And, we'd all developed really quite serious drinking habits. So when I was writing Fischlottetech, I was, a, very isolated and alone, and, b, largely pissed.

And, you know, lines like that, Bitchy, Lionel Richie. You can't. Yes. I can. No.

You can't. Yes. I can. You can. You know?

Just these these arguments you have with yourself. Like the time that I dug out the old tape of, Caroline Wheeler's birthday present, and I said to the cat, we know a classic when we hear one still. The, you know, the internal dialogue that goes on quite often out loud is absolutely laughable. You wouldn't believe it. You really wouldn't.

But I do. You know, I have shouting matches with myself. Which takes us inevitably to living in it. Yeah. Well, I mean, that I've written right here.

Written right here. I've probably been in this pub that very night. You know? And, yeah, it began with the the locution. You're living in a village.

And I don't know. Like, just that Graceland stuff, just that Zulu music got into my head. You know? Is it is it a calypso style? Would you would you say it's a calypso?

It wasn't what I was aiming for. I was aiming for a sort of South African, Zimbabwean pop style. Oddly enough, we never quite got that until Stevie Greffler. Yeah. I saw that And he just had a he had a real he had a real facility for that beat.

I I I was saying to the band, I said, well, we could try this one. It's very simple chords, but I don't know about the beat. I don't really know because it's an African beat, and I don't know as a as a musician quite how to describe it. Do you know what I'm talking about, Steve? And he just played it.

And I yeah. That's it. That's it. Right. You got GCD.

Come on. And so we did it for a while. It's kind of fun. Also, because I'd learned to play a nice sort of African guitar part for it. It was fun to be able to play that as well.

It was just nice to be able to, enjoy the playing. Is is there affection or more need to get out? Because there's definite lines of gotta get out of this village. Yeah. Yeah.

Goober, goober, goober, get out of this village. Yeah. I mean, that was very much the vibe because it's not so much talking you know, it's not really the village's fault, but it's the fact. Again, you know, of having been grounded here for several months. And it's like, no.

Transport being poor and Well, yeah. Once literally, once the bus had gone. Yeah. Because because they say, isn't it? You'd rush right to the city, but the bus don't come this way because you're living in a village.

You know? So, yeah, I mean, that that that poured out in about three and a half minutes, I should think. Let me tell you the, funny thing about Sutlanger's Wikipedia entry, which I think has been infiltrated. It has one? I think it's been infiltrated.

Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know, if you could work if you could work at Wikipedia, you might have done it yourself. But there is a line in Shudnoyne's Wikipedia entry which says Friday. There is also an abandoned double decker red bus Either at the Brad Lawn.

Train tracks and a large collection of vintage porn from the seventies. Famous residents include ancestors of the Bridgerton Gap. Now that's not for me, is it? Someone's inserted that. I've no idea.

I don't know about any double decker bus. There's old railway tracks and parts of Paul in the woods for sure, but, you know, you show me an old railway track with woods that hasn't got parts of Paul in it. We're talking about this just the other night, actually, Duran and I. It's been like white dog shit. You know, in the seventies, every ticket had born in it.

Famous residents include ancestors of the Richardson gang. I it just it just it just stinks of fake light, and someone's just stuck in for a laugh, I think. But that's I have no idea. I mean, the only people I know that came from here that were famous, Derek Redmond, the Olympic runner. And I often wonder if he might possibly be Nathan Redmond's dad, you know, Nathan who plays for Southampton Football Club.

I don't know, but, you know, they're just black men called Redmond. There are probably quite a lot of those, but, yeah, they were they were the first black people to move into the Shuttlanger, the Redmonds. And, yeah, Derek was just a a little boy, you know, nine years old. He ended up being an Olympian. Embraced by the Midwest.

The black kids in the village, embraced by the Midwestern white folk. I don't think there was any difficulty. No. It's good. No.

I know a bit of a novelty, I think. Yeah. We already had Indian people living here. But, yeah, no. I don't I don't remember any animosity towards them at all.

They're nice people. Talking of black dogs here, there's there's obviously a mention in living in a village. Oh, well, I mean Walking on stilts in those days. No. It wasn't dog shit.

It was the in. They used to march the up and down the roads when I was in Nipper, and the roads would really you know, they'd be, like, two or three inches deep in cow shit everywhere. That's what that is. I mean, most villages were like that in the sixties and the seventies, I think. You know?

Just mook house walking about. Yeah. And I like mook house a lot, but they're a bit careless where they dump. Swell is this week's song, I think. Yeah.

That was written for the tie in the angry American wife. Although there's no actual literal stealing from it, a lot of the vibe from that comes from a Velvet Underground song called It's Alright. You know, It's Alright the Way That You Live, which at the time was only on bootlegs. It's come out a 100 times now on various bits and pieces, but Lou had a very nice song about it's just one of those sort of arm around the shoulder songs. It's just like, don't worry about it.

It's supposed to be one of those. And so I guess, you know and again, I mean, what what are my experiences of songs that put arms around my shoulder? Well, a lot of them are from Lou Reed. You know? And the chick's from New York, and the whole thing gets that vibe.

I wasn't particularly happy about the rendition. We tried it with that same rhythm section of Preacher and Errol that did, lot 49. But Errol in particular really wasn't quite up to it. So in the end, we canned the rhythm track and just rebuilt it with, one of those cheapo sort of home entertainment drum machines. We wanted it to sound cheap.

You know? And then Lawrence came in and put bass over that. That's the first thing he recorded with us. Doesn't matter what time you get home. Yeah.

All that it doesn't matter stuff was very much that was the vibe of it's alright the way that you live. I think that if there is a grow up and shut up. If there is a direct lift in there, it may well be that line that it doesn't matter about the streets you're walking down. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that turn up in it's alright the way that you live. But, again, you know, that that was it it did matter at the time because half the time we were in Manhattan and half the time we were right here.

And that's quite a strange thing to do. You know? So to say that doesn't matter, it's a sort of, you know, saying there's more important things. Looking for not 49. Well, it's pretty obvious.

I haven't read any Pynchon. Mhmm. Do I need to go away and read the book? It's as good a way into Pynchon as any because it's quite short, and it's very funny. It was it was the first thing of his that I read, and it made such an impression.

Because lot 49 in the book is all about a sinister alternative ancient postal service. I know that sounds ridiculous in an age where, like, we've got Whistle and UPS and all these different people. But in the old days, when we just had the post office to read about this sinister underground post office network, you know, it was it was it was crazy shit. And, it was at a time, 8687, when we were starting to get quite a lot of mail. 50 Banks Lane, wasn't it?

Yes. Sikorsky's house. Whose house? Earl Sikorsky. Yeah, how much I've written?

I must I'm sure I've written that. Yeah. There was a there was a We we would little fans even. Also, what's Yeah. Whatever.

Yeah. Well, Dave Dave Barker said. Right? All proper pop stars have a fan club. And so we did.

And then what we what we hadn't expected was that anyone was gonna write in. We thought it would just be a cool thing to put on the record sleeve as though we had a fan club. And then suddenly, because we put that there, we did. And like these letters would, they would lift your game, especially in that '87 when nothing was happening. You know, it was it was a real lift.

Some some bloke suddenly writes in from, like, Switzerland or something. You know, it's, it gives you a lift, and that's what I wanted to say in the song. Plus, of course, there's a load of hilarity because Alex, the saxophone player, despite the melody maker routinely describing him as a session sax player at the time, was actually a postman. So, you know, there's that man on the side with egg in his hair. He's got hands like Des Nilsen.

I don't like his stare. Every time I look out of my window, he's there. But he's under the postman. Yeah. Yeah.

It's it's getting all sinister. Right? But, oh, of course, it's sinister. It's Alex, the postman. Didn't realize that.

Yeah. Yeah. There was this weird thing for about three live reviews in a row. The melody maker just moaned and said, oh, they'd be better off without that session sax player. And I used to write him letters.

Like, he's not a session sax player, you muppets. He's a fucking postman. Quite like, cold light of day and the heat of the night. Makes me wonder if languages turned out quite right. Yeah.

And I think the thing that makes that is the that makes the song is the sort of manicness of it, but then the then the break, you may want want to carry on. The break there. That that's Yeah. So Which I'm sure it's it's tried and tested, and it's it's been done lots of times before. I know, but it's it's, it makes it stand out.

Yeah. It has effective, I think. Yeah. It allows the lyric to sort of jump in and take center stage. Which yeah.

It's it's startling, you know, in a way. Yeah. Alan last night, Alan Moore had a couple of hours on BBC six music with Richard Norris from the grid, and he was talking about Patti Smith, the song break it up. And he was saying there's a moment where she says, and I broke on through. And he says it's it's almost like there's a beat that misses before she does it.

I don't know, but it's it's it's a real moment. And it went by. You know, I heard the moment, and I went, oh, well. And he's just squelched the high hat. That's all.

It's just for effect. But, you know, this is this is the thing. For us, like, it's nuts and bolts. It's just like putting a motorcycle together in your garage on a Saturday morning. But even for someone like Alan, it makes all the difference.

You know? So you mentioned Patty, who is now obviously in the in the naughties. She's she's picking poems from the the anthologies. Yeah. But back then, she's, well, she's there for some girl, some fictional girl called Susie.

Some, you've already mentioned her being a Susie the cipher. Yeah. The cipher. Yeah. Yeah.

But when she was Pissing on AT. Pissing on so many middle aged ladies in America's dreams there, but it's a cipher lady. Sorry. But she's, I've I've had women walk up to me after gigs and say, hi. I'm Susie.

That's literally happened to me. But I quite like that it paints a picture even if it's fiction. It may not be entirely fiction of when she was 18, see what sort of paint No. That's me. That's me.

When I was 18, I saw the Patti Smith group on TV, and it changed what I wanted to be. It's you know? Yeah. As I say, she's just a a mechanism. And the whole song was, like, conceived as a sort of cowl of self justification.

And I was still feeling really paranoid, and I didn't know if I was gonna get back in with this record that I was writing. I didn't know if it was gonna be enough to put me back where I'd been. And if it wasn't, what the bloody hell was I gonna do with the rest of my life? You know? Go back.

So I was the lawyers. It was quite a not a not a chance. It's not that I couldn't do it, but there's no way to earn a living, is it? Making money out of other people's problems. No.

I I really like the baseline in Susie. I think it sort of trots along. Oh. Underneath everything. Oh, Greenwood.

Yeah. He came he came up with that by himself. It's it it it kinda tickled me because it's quite purple. You know, it's it's quite portentous. Yeah.

But it kinda sits alright. Kinda sits alright. I've been I've been flirting with doing Susie now for several months, and I thought I might get it out in Paris, but I ended up to have I just had too many songs to fit in, so it had to go. What's the bit about, you have to you just believe your own publicity. You have to live somewhere, don't you see?

Yeah. Well, I mean, this is the thing. It's 1987. I've been doing it for about three years properly, professionally. I've had this little hiatus, and I'm looking over my shoulder.

I'm looking over my shoulder. I think I'm I think it's quite possibly I might be finished. You know? And there's that line, if you don't know what's so good about candy, don't ask Susie and me. Well, earlier that same evening, I put on the John Peel show, and I heard these idiots from Stowbridge going, what's so fucking good?

What's so fucking good about candy? And I said, well, if you don't know, you know, if if you don't have drugs in Stourbridge, then I can't help you. Pathetic. And then people ask me the strangest questions, such a fate and such a illusion. Yeah.

I mean, that's that's just yeah. That is just like, you know experience you felt that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

That people would would would, you know, there's a bit of an element of pedestal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, people yeah.

Of course. People come and then, you know, they go like, oh, it's so great. This is such great art. You're thinking, well, love is just dog rule and multitracking. You know?

It's it's no big deal. But then as that verse rolls on, then you get the the money dies on it, and suddenly it becomes a product and it becomes you know, someone's got this touching faith in a transparent illusion, and somebody else is going like, yeah. Right. That's it. You're not seeing your friends.

You're doing this. And, you know, it's just it's just a sort of Just like Morris dances. Well, yeah. Again, that's looking over your shoulder. It's like, mate, you finished.

You're out you're out of date. This is this is old hat, you know, what you're doing here. And in fact, if you look at where we are historically at the dawn of '88, you know, we've only got four months to go until acid house suddenly explodes and middle wall of guzzling ecstasy, you know. So I wasn't I wasn't that far off with that. But, yeah, it's just, And, of course, the sort of sock is is is made in a way by Sonix.

You can describe it as an outburst. You know? It's quite, Yeah. Quite an effective outburst. Yeah.

No. He was he was always gonna be the man for the job. He was always gonna be the man to do that. So should so he just comes in to stick his guitar? Yeah.

You know, I can't remember if he came down back. I don't remember if he came down to just socialize and hang out or if he came down specifically to do that. He must have brought his back with him, so he probably came deliberately. Yeah. But, yeah, I knew I wanted him to do that.

So how does he how does he actually, engineer that noise? He turns it up chronically loud. He hits the appropriate bits, and then he goes mad with the old whammy bar. So you get, like, stuff. He's really good at that.

But there was an amusing moment. We got him in the studio, and I'm sitting in the controller, and I'm coming down and talk back. I go, alright. So all you gotta do, man, is just wig out. It's just d.

And he goes right here, and it goes quiet, and we're, like, queuing it up. And then he comes back down to talk back. He goes, Pat, I got Sonic. He goes, which string's d? I shit you not.

I shit you not. That guy you know, he got two albums in the can at this point. Which string's d? Show me again. Show me again.

Yeah. Yeah. But as as you see, it kinda turned out for the best. Yeah. It was a very social session there because Perfect Disaster were working in one of the other studios nearby, and we got them in do some daft backing vocals on the Chicken song.

And, yeah, they were there. And, oh, there's all sorts of people. Knox came in. He was working with Charlie Harper next door with The UK subs. It was great to meet Knox.

He sat there and he went, I'm thinking about Charlie. Right? He's kind of a genius. And, you know, I suppose he is. And I think also sort of what makes the end of that record, of these, lines, what could I do but care?

I think it's quite Issue payoff. Yeah. Cool. And, of course, Sonic had those away. There was kind of his payment for doing the feedback was when he did that song Angel on his solo LP.

And you actually hear him going. He goes, hey, Pat. What could I do but care? So it's like a little payback thing. This is this is the moment where it starts to get complicated between Sonic, Jason, Phil Parfit, and me because we're all nicking bits out of each other's songs and then giving each other little, what's the word, acknowledgements.

You know? So, yeah, I once turned up at this radio station in, LA, at Loyola University, And the guy there was obviously completely uninterested in this band that had been sent for him to interview. And the first thing we did, he was going into the sort of record racks and just nosing around the records and paying me really no mind at all. And I pulled out Sonic's 12 inch of angel, which had just come out since we'd left the country. And I was like, oh, yeah.

I'm on this. He's like, oh, really? Yeah. I'm doing the finger pops. And, well, play the record, and I'll show you.

So we had Pete singing what can I do but care on that? And then I found that he had, Asylum Road by Perfect Disaster. And we were doing Girl Go on the tour, and I said, well, you see, you gotta understand. This Girl Go here, right, this is stolen from this on Perfect Disaster. And if you listen to the French sample at the top end of Girl Go, you'll hear her saying, which is to say, have you seen All the Stars, which is the title of the Perfect Disaster song we're ripping off.

Yeah. An hour later, we were still at it. Because, like, he went from, like, not knowing who the fuck we were, like, get this off my shoe, to, like, putting together all these connections, and he was just fascinated. It just it just didn't stop. And that's what it was like around that period.

We're all just vibing off each other and hanging out and you know? Anything that anyone said could end up in somebody else's song. We'll we'll go back to the chicken songs in a bit. But thinking about the sort of nice way to wrap up the album with, keeping the curtains closed and which is Dal Vitsy again, I guess. Mentioned as a bus stop again.

There's a recurring bus stop thing. Yeah. Because when he comes around, he'll be as happy as a boy can be. Yeah. But he's not coming around.

That's the trouble. We've established that on track one, side one. You know? This is the problem. So what's he doing?

Oh, he's doing that thing again. He's walking away again just like Love Kittens, just like mine, like a playgroup, just like my desert. He's walking away again, and he's keeping the curtains closed. You couldn't make it clearer, could you? Yeah.

Nice nice little song. Yeah. We played it the other night. Me and Tim, it's the first time I'd ever played it out live. The the way best chicken.

I always saw until I looked it up, with Orson Welles. It sounds like an Orson Welles app, doesn't it? And it turns out to be some guy called Hello? What's that? Turns out to be some guy called Bob Steele, a Connecticut radio.

That's him. Yeah. So you must have reported it somehow when you're in America, or you got a hold of it somehow? I got a hold of it from Barry Hale, who runs Threshold Studios. It's a film thing.

We go he's he's the same generation as me, Dave Jay, Northampton Geezer. And he was always great on collecting just mad tapes and assembling mad cassette assemblages and so forth. And, yeah, he he had this guy rambling on about chickens, and I don't know what inspired it. I think it might have been the noises that I was making as I started putting down the backing track. I just you know, I'm just jack doing a jam in d minor.

I mean, it might as well be, like, careful with the axe Eugene by the Pink Floyd or something. And I'm just doing this jam, but something in it put chickens in my head. I think possibly just the sound of some of the guitars going. I don't know. But then it all came tumbling out.

You know, chicken over here, dead hanging under what? Mhmm. I wonder what that's about. It's pretty straightforward, isn't it, really? Yeah.

It got used. They did a film called Meathead, which was like one of these sort of radical vegetarian video cassettes, of course, in those days. And Captain Sensible did some stuff on it, and they they used our stuff. And it was brilliant because, like, someone had just, like, sneaked a camera into one of these horrible battery chicken sheds. And the tune is starting, and it's sort of the beat is just grinding.

You know? So and the camera's just panning out, and it's just a carpet of chickens as far as the eye can see. There's no floor visible. They're packed in so hard. So that easy.

They eat their own legs. Yeah. They do well, actually, what they do is they chew their feet off, but it was close enough for close enough for a dog roll. Rhymes with eggs. And rhymes with eggs.

I only know two words that rhyme with eggs. One is legs, and the other one is steaks. So given that I suppose you could say, you know, they go so damn crazy because they used to be steggs. It would be kinda true. But They're like pigs.

The legs, aren't they? Oh, yeah. They're pigs, I suppose, as in peg leg. Yeah. Yeah.

And segs, they're things that go on the end of clogs, and they steal bits on the end of your clogs. JPEGs these days. Yeah. Didn't really have access to that bit of vocabulary back then. Limited vocabulary artist.

But this, Bob Steele in, what I don't know where. What's the town in Connecticut? Rhode Island. There's a there's a famous town. It's not Ridgeport.

I know Rhode Island's a state in itself, isn't it? Anyway Bridgeport? His his hometown. There's a plaque in a wall. There's a whole thing on this guy, and he mentions this, philosopher Ken Morrister.

Yes. Who isn't, really? There's another Villa Thomas? Yeah. Cutting parts.

Yeah. Ridiculous. I mean, you know, when I was around these parts as a kid and even as an adult, you'd never see me walking on or by the road. I'd always be out there. So why are they on animals in the road?

Because they're fucking entitled bourgeois filth. That's right. I want to bring everyone to a bleeding standstill for their own personal convenience. And then the last thing on the album we haven't mentioned is Chicken Town that the thing must be half murdered by that band. It's not the only thing those poor souls half murdered.

But you've got, you know, you gotta give him points for trying. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I It takes a nasty picture of Chicken Town. So Yeah.

I mean, to some extent, it's justified. I used to like that line where people where people look upset because the weather's bad again. That was that was from direct personal experience on the Market Square one morning, these people just walking around scowling because the weather's bad again. He said, well, what do you think? It's England.

It's November. You know? Grow up. I said to my wife before, you know, embrace the rain. Come on.

Cheer up. Yeah. It's only water. Yeah. Yeah.

I've, I went on a long tramping walk at one point. You know? I don't know who I thought I was. Eric Blair or someone. I thought, you know, I can pretend to be a tramp for a few days.

So you hit the road? So I walked about a 100 miles in three days Wow. Which is which is a pace that no tramp would would ever make. Stupid stupid paste. And I ripped my shoes to shreds.

Yeah. Feet to shreds. Yeah. And and I and I had and there was a day where I got wet and dried walking and got wet and three times over, which is which is what happens when you're tramping. Yeah.

You you you get wet, but then thoroughly wet, and then you dry out through the walking, and you thoroughly dry Fluff up. And then all over again. One night, I slept in, the away dugout of a village, a village, football ground. Very appropriate that you should choose the away dugout, I think. So four, when did you?

Yeah. Yeah. You'd probably find the home one's much more comfortable. I think this is the trouble with the Spurs losing away at the minute is, like, they just, you know, they just now they've got their new super baths at the new super stadium. It's like anything else.

It's like, boss, boss, I can't I can't work with this. Yeah. There is there's a whole thing about psychology of of away dressing rooms, isn't there? Mhmm. Being uncomfortable and, in hospitable places.

Oh, very much so. Palatial. And I've seen I've seen it at the I I went on a tour of the Leicester ground, I think, once when I worked in Leicester. Oh, yeah. And that's very much like that.

Yeah. No. They it's a deliberate it's a deliberate thing. When, there was a many years ago now, Manchester United were drawn in the third round of the FA Cup at Northampton Town. And, of course, United had our glory glory song away.

Right? They always sing glory glory man united. And about six weeks before the game, my mate Curtis showed up, and he had got hold of a CD copy of that lost Joe Meek album, I Hear a New World. And in amongst the daft outer space instrumentals was the weirdest version of Glory Glory you've ever heard. It's a Woah.

Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah.

Mental space age Joe Meek music, right, of the Glory Glory song. And I thought if we could get that to Northampton Town and they could play that as United come out, that would really mess with their heads. You know? It's it's your tune, but as you've never heard it before. But sadly, we didn't pull it off, and United won the game.

Well, we finished off, chicken town. German shepherd. I like some of the references, some of the lyrics in that German shepherd man. Yeah. And as I said before, the filling out with drone.

Got empty fertilizer bags and so on. Yeah. Empty fertilizer bags would be part of my youth. Used to sit on them and slide them down the side of the old railway embankments. So, like, empty fertilizer bags were our sort of toboggans.

You know? Yeah. I like some lyrics in it. It's not I sometimes feel a bit churlish for writing it because, you know, I'm quite fond of Northampton. Yeah.

But when you get up to the sort of administrative end of things, if you get, you know, you get up to the people who are actually allegedly running the show. Yeah. That's deplorable. It's been happening. Yeah.

They're they're a bunch of corrupt filth. You know, chicken town maneuvers keep the punters on their toes in a small town, don't they? And, you know, the the police protect the villains because the villains know the law. I'm gonna hold up in my living room and lean against the door. You know, you you gotta understand.

If you if you're gonna move into Northampton, it's gonna take them twenty five, thirty years before they talk to you. And they weren't talking to me yet at this point. And this was before they were, you know, spending millions of pounds on, on fictional football signs and all sorts of stuff and and generally bankrupting the place. Well, the the Cardozers are yet to sink their teeth into the town's money. Yeah.

But it's just really I mean, it's it's just a general criticism of, like, corrupt small town bourgeoisie thinking. You know? And also that kind of preemptive, scornful, resentful thinking among the supposedly working classes that allows the knobs to get away with their outrages. You know, if if people sit and go, and they're all in the same man and all that sort of nonsense, then yeah. Yeah.

Well, there you go. You've just voted to be shafted right there. You know, if you really think that you if you really can't distinguish between, like, Dennis Skinner and Michael Heseltine, if you really can't tell the difference between David Lammy and fucking Laura Goonsperk. You know, you're talking nonsense, my friend. You're you're you're just throwing in the towel.

You're just you're just voting for you're just voting for the far right, if that's what you think. What's the what did you say in Paris about your parents and the bourgeoisie? Oh, I I I said I was eternally grateful to them for giving me a silly hard mistrust of the bourgeoisie. And then Tim bless him and goes, yeah. Right on.

I said, they didn't do it on purpose. Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's just hanging around with some of the people my mother used to associate with around here.

It's just very educational. Likewise, getting sent to the fucking Rutland. Being around the children of the nineteen seventies bourgeoisie, that, you know, that turned me more lefty than anything could have done. Which is why you didn't wanna go back that far. I don't want anything to do with it.

Don't want anything to do with it. I've done enough drives up there. Tell us about the, as we're in Shutlanger, tell us about the other the other song that's about Shutlanger. Eviva Schuttlanger? Oh, this year, I'm looking for a change.

Eviva Schuttlanger. Down where the cats have got the mange. Eviva Schatlanger. If you fancy a spot of something If you fancy a spot of Hesketh's game, perhaps, or cold bacon clanger. Or Hesketh's pheasants by the score.

Yeah. We used to sing it right in there. It was quite when Dave had it, there was a lot of folk singers who used to come down. And, one night, Max and I, we came in, and we were a little bit unsure of ourselves. So we went in the posh downstairs bar, and we found ourselves sharing the posh downstairs bar with 13 accordionists.

That'll be a murder of Yeah. Oh, it was it was a catastrophe. It was a it was a mass murder. It was, yeah, it was a mass murder in a multi story car park. It was just oh, man.

It was insane. Because, like, you know, they wouldn't all be playing the same tune. There'd be two or three gathered around learning one tune, and then there'd be couple over there learning another tune. And we'd just be sitting there going, I can't stand it. But, yeah, it used to be a jolly spot in those days.

And, yeah, on a couple of occasions, people drank so hard that they came out at, like, two in the morning and were found dead the next morning by the bus shower, which eventually, sadly, of course, led to Dave not having the pub anymore. So this other shot language song is of your invention? No. I didn't write it. No.

It's it's it's, as we put it, Trad r. No. I don't I don't know who came up with that. But, Well, it's copyright free then. I suppose.

Yeah. Not so sure about the tune. Right. Before we finish, tell me where where about spooky came along. When was that recorded?

Is that between, That was recorded in fish fish go tap and the It was recorded in May at a place called Greenhouse, which was also belonged to Pat Collier, but it was this sort of new upwardly mobile fancy studio. And we went up there. We took our Higgins again. It's up near Old Street near the city. Lovely, lovely facility, and it was absolutely running with hummus.

I don't know how much hummus me and Kizzy got through in that session. But then it got a bit ugly for me because I got toothache. While we were mixing it, I got toothache, and it was really severe. So I took these things called paracodol. And it they fizz up in your glass, and you drink them.

And they're quite effective at stunning a toothache, but I took so many of them that they began to hurt my kidneys. I can actually feel the pain in my kidneys. So the the end of that session was actually quite stressful. And then you made a video. Oh, we did that at the college at Booth Lane in Northampton with Mitch and Barry.

Barry was involved in that as well. It's before Mitch and Barry fell out. And a big smoke machine. Well, yeah. A smoke machine.

And the camera lingering lovingly on my American wife's behind. Oh, so you married your American wife by that stage? I married her in September in Toaster at a party up the street. Must have spent all of £75 on my wedding. Those were the days.

Well, you know, I mean That's all you need. Weren't we weren't deluded. All our mates came. We had as good a time as we had a good a time as we would have done if we'd spent $40 on it. So we didn't have $40 to spend.

Nobody did. So it's a very jolly day. We've had a couple of people over from New York. That was comical. Phil Parfit from The Perfect Disaster kept chasing this girl, Sabrina, from New York, who's sort of like I once heard Sabrina in, 1986 in New York complaining because she was only on $70,000 a year.

And, yeah, she came over here for the wedding and spent most of her time being chased around the woods by Phil Popfit. Oh, how we laughed. But then again, me and me and the missus got out fairly early in the evening and headed for Amsterdam. What carnage was left behind, I will never know. My parents are far too diplomatic to tell me what happened later.

So it's a proper family family do too. Parents were around. Yeah. And her parents came over as well. I think they were thoroughly bewildered by the whole thing.

Or has she got herself into it? Yeah. Vintage motorbikes. Maybe time to think about getting a less vintage exhaust, though. That'll do, I think.

Yeah.

Bingo. Hello. Clarity and waveforms, science and magic. Oh, rounds and catches. Haste the nymph.

Don't type all this out. Sacred songs. Transcripts that maybe you're getting too worried about. They are they are transcripts. So Yeah.

I I I was thinking that I think I'm right in saying that with Microsoft Word, there's a a thing where you can, like, get it to pull out a single word, and whatever you do to that word, you can macro it right across the thing. Right? Okay. First advice, remove all kinda. Remove all fucking.

I'll put them back in where I feel like it. But kinda and fucking can fuck off. And it'd be really nice if because could turn into because. Yes. I with that and those are the sorts of things that we we do need to agree on.

And I and I was thinking about that. It's gotta be in English. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not I'm not keen on the kind as in cause.

It's just the way you know? Yeah. It's just the transcript. Absolutely. It's just a transcript.

Yeah. I understand that. You know? Same with the punctuation. I know.

I understand why it's all over the place. It's just turns out to be a hell of a sweeping up job. I quite like the I quite like the swearing. Yeah. But it needs to be judiciously deployed.

Yeah. Measured, I guess. Yeah. Otherwise, there's little impact. Yeah.

You know, I mean, my conversational style, especially when I'm trying to explain things and sometimes backtracking and repeating, It's not really fit for putting down on paper. But there's still some there's some there's some nuggets there still. There's there's a few moments I spotted. Made me chuckle. Yeah.

Yeah. So I think, what I will probably do after transcribing this last one is to then have a go at one or two. You and I can share our thoughts having had Compare notes. Yeah. Yeah.

And and and Yeah. It'll it'll finesse a bit. I'm sure. Well, I mean, there's there's there's no alternative as missus Thatcher would have it. It's got to.

Yes. That's, that's why Oh, we we wanna put out my physical team. You know? There was no alternative. Yeah.

There was no alternative other than to stay while until the insurance was sorted out, regardless of whether I had a an important appointment. Oh, yeah. This is I'd be calling this an important appointment. So, I mean, I suppose with every new ton of work that we throw up for ourselves, it grows more important to us at least. But I did a little bit of, before we had the, insurance department.

Yeah. I was, doing finding some fun Jasper Churchill facts in numbers Oh, yes. Just to reflect on a bit. So Jasper Conspiracy has been in existence for thirty eight years. Has it?

Yes. Well, if you're saying eight, '82 and the twenty year the twenty year anniversary tour was 02/2002. And so Max and Max and I see the sort of foundation of the project from '82, really. Yeah. That's when we started making bath of bacon and so forth.

I suppose that for me, anyway, in my memory, the trigger date is the day after the Sonic Tonics reunion in the '82. And a lot, you know, a lot of the jazz butcher songs were written at that point and demoed on sort of, like, bedroom tapes. But it was pretty much just me doing it solitary. And it was like, I can remember taking the bus up to our place in Northampton the day after that tonics thing, taking the bus up with Ida and him going, like, what's with all these songs? And then that's that's pretty much the day that I would say that he and I sort of accidentally founded something that we thought was gonna last a couple of months.

So, yeah, I suppose '82. But the conspiracy itself, the actual existence of a band, that didn't really come about until early eighty four when we got Owen in on the drums and the first of a lengthy and complicated succession of bass players. I know we've talked before about the imperfections of the website, but I'm using it for reference quite a bit. Mhmm. And I counted up the total number of gigs.

Uh-huh. Just for fun, you know. And, this includes the solo gig. Yeah. Does he not run does he not run a count of that somewhere on the website himself?

Yeah. He does a yearly yearly count. Yeah. Yeah. How many do you think in total according to him in that record?

Somewhat I would think with Dave's rankings about between seventeen fifty and two thousand. No. That's a bit high. 1,200 he's listed. Really?

Yeah. 1,200. Eight four five of which were listed as JBC. Right. I'll look to see what because I I was I was thinking, there was something about thousandth appearance of something recently.

Was there? Yeah. That does ring a dim a dim and distant bell, but of no great significance to me to me, to be honest, because, obviously, there's so many different ways of doing things and so many different formats and groups of people that I don't really think of it in overall terms like that. The thousandth, according to his reckoning, was playing just in front of 15 people at the White Horse in Woodford with Steve Wilson. That was a night.

I don't even know how that gig happened. I think Steve must have booked it. How? I have no idea. I used to go to the White Horse quite a bit.

Well, probably a decade ago. Yeah. Whatever it was. There was it was a thoroughly moribund event. And do you have the name of the village that the white horse was in there?

It's in Woodford. Yeah. Woodford. Yeah. You see, that gate got moved.

Initially, I think it was supposed to be in a place called Isham. Either that or it was supposed to be in Woodford, and it actually happened in Isham. Did you go? No. I think so.

I did, but all I remember was that I was in the Badlands. And I can remember Steve Wilson properly freaking out. It's like, oh my god. We're going in the woods. Oh, what's gonna happen to us?

Oh, well, we'll probably get raped and eaten, Steve. Why do you ask? Yeah. Oh, Christ. What a, oh, what a thoroughly moribund evening.

Exactly what you'd expect of a pub in the out in the Badlands. You know? There was band on there, and, unbelievably, I remember their name. They were called Dave Boy Fish and the Wheel. And I think the idea with Dave Boy Fish and the Hiel was that they were supposed to be in some way comedic or or chummy or funny or something.

I don't know. I it's not for me to judge. I paid them no mind. Until at the end of this set, they started performing master master of the universe from the album Space Ritual by Hawkwind. Now, actually, me and this song have history.

You've mentioned Hawkwind before, I think. And we'll make we may possibly mention them again. Yeah. No. So as it happens, me and Master of the Universe have history.

But, on this occasion, Dave Boy Fish and his heel were performing this thing. And they'd really sort of when I did it a 100,000,000 ago in some band in school, not a real band, but just some sort of school jam session, I can remember doing it because that was the moment I met Rolo. Yes. And you've mentioned that. Yeah.

You've talked Should be a bit meaner, shouldn't it? Yeah. That's it. Yeah. But we were basically playing it quite sort of open and just because we were, like, 16 years old and didn't know anything.

So we were playing it to, like, like that. Whereas Dave Boy Fish and his eel, they pulled out the syncopation in the whole Queen version much more. They're kind. Pulling it out like that. And they did that for a few bars, and then Steve Wilson just looked at me across the table and went, is Vic there?

And that was it. We couldn't stop laughing after that. It's just like they were trying to sing the Hawkwind number, and there were these drunks at the back going, it's Victor. And that was our thousandth gig. Was it bloody Christ.

Well, according to the record, the the record. It it'd be much it'd be much nicer if we just forgot about that one and went to the next sort of nice gig with some people there and some money in the stage and some lights and shit. And no Dave Boyfisher. He'll doing his bit there. And then according to the record, there have been a 181 JBC songs or Jasper Butchers songs.

Mhmm. Plus the 14 Seymour's on it, plus the 13 Wilson. 208 in all. And we have mentioned in some detail most of them. Yeah.

Apart from 12 that I've listed. So I meticulously went through that list. I see. Just checked checked the ones that we had not covered and and arrived at the number 12. Oh, it's gonna be so much fun to see if you've got them all.

Well, yeah. Well, I've I've checked all the others. I'm pretty sure all the others are in. The ones that I think this I'm trying I've tried to list them roughly in chronological order, but, again, I may have got this wrong. Sure.

Cowgirl Fever. It's a Marnie b side. Yes. That owes a lot to the violent femmes. And what it owes to the violent femmes is the line, up the air.

There was a particular day in 1983 that turned into a very important day. The violent films were in London. Rolo and I were both very taken with their first LP. We thought it was a real sort of, like, return to basics, you know, and and really good songs as well and a good vibe. So we were we were right into them at the time.

And, they were in London, and they decided to you know, being able to do it with their instrumentation, they decided to go on a busking tour of the city. And we caught up with them in, Covent Garden, where they were singing a song called Girl Trouble Up the Ass. And so the Cowgirl Feeder thing was just really a piss takeout on that. It was, a wee tipo that. And there's large chunks of, It's Just Too Much by the Velvets of Live sixty nine in the middle as well.

Yeah. Yeah. Not not what I would describe as an exercise in serious songwriting. JB versus PM. Oh, just a minute.

I said that was an important day, didn't I? And it wasn't important because I managed to steal the words up, v, and arse of the violent femmes. That wasn't what was important at all. Once the violent femmes had expressed themselves in Sharpe and moved on, Rose said to me, have you heard the new John K LLP? I went, no.

He said, it's important. Come with me. We left Covent Garden, and we got on a train, and we went all down to, sort of North Clapham, Stockwell where he lived. And we went into his living room, and he put on Music for a New Society. And, he was not wrong.

He was not wrong. Bless him. That is a very, very important record. I was thinking of, John Kale songs or interpretations anyway. Yeah.

We've done a few, I guess. Sprint. But that's relating, to the 2020 Ida release. Oh, because yeah. Yeah.

Because Cahill does the, does the general Thomas, doesn't he? On Words for the Dying. Yeah. Do not go general. Yes.

You know, and Ida has taken that, throttled all the throttled all the fight out of it And it's and presented it as something beautiful. Very gentle. I I did you know, the the cruel streak in me did think, when he was posting this release, you know, that I must just write rage. Rage. Yeah.

In in a comments bar, but I I resisted. We should no. We should do better than that. We should, on a nice day in the summer, we should hire a bus from, Country Lion, and we should get a whole bunch of our mates on it. And we should make sure there's loads of booze and drugs on this bus.

And then having first carefully established that Ida is at home and not his girlfriend's house at the other end of the nation, we should drive this thing up in sort of football football outing sort of mode, everybody getting plastered on the bus. And when we arrive in, Spital, which is the name of the place where he lives, unbelievably, yeah, when we arrive in Spital, we just form a ring around his house just chanting rage, rage, rage, rage, and actually have an Ida riot. See what the Northumbria can stab for the remakes of that. It's the bloody worst thing since those Spurs fans invaded Carlisle. JVVPM?

Yeah. It is. Again, it's, it's sort of of that, era of rain and other things, isn't it? It was quite sort of tight, David j on bass and just that sort of, It is Dave on bass. Yeah.

It was recorded at the Scandal in Bohemia sessions. Yeah. What I really remember about it is, Owen doing his Neil Kinnock impression. The honorable lady thing is telling that we all had a nice cup of tea. And, yeah, there's there's a lot of mucking about on that.

Again, hardly a you know, these things are on b sides, so you can kinda guess that they're not the most important songs that ever got written. I'm trying to think of anything constructive to say about it. Mulraney had a nice take on that song. I don't quite know why, but on the eighty nine tour of America, we revived it. No idea why that happened.

And, Paul would introduce it with a little drum part of his drum part just, solo drum intro. That's what I'm trying to say. And he would play sixes. It would sound like a four, but he'd be playing sixes. He'd be going, like that.

And I don't know if he got the idea from there or not, but you can hear the same thing at the beginning of a David Bowie single, Modern Love. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know.

Yeah. Six played in a way that makes it sound as though it's a four, but then it trips you up every every couple of yards. Then you throw in a smart suit and a bleached blonde hair. That that sort of era. Yeah.

I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can kinda see him in my man's eye waving his microphone lead about.

Re trying to save the natives in Australia. That sort of time. That was the Let's Dance video, wasn't it, with the Aboriginal gents? Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. This is not a period of David Bowie where I was really paying a great deal of attention to him. But when Paul nicked that drumming trial, I thought, good work, Mul Rainey. And there's mention of, you know, lots of animals, isn't there?

And, and famous criminals. Henley Brady, Harding and Hobbs or something. Something almost like Yeah. Now you see Harding and Hobbs. That's weird.

Harding and Hobbs. Is it? Harding and Hobbs is or was. I don't know if it's still there. I hope it is.

Harding and Hobbs was a big old fashioned department store at Clapham Junction. It was it was very, very close to Starforce where we first recorded Martha Bacon. It was on on that same sort of part of Clapham. And it was wonderful in Harding and Hobbs. It was still it was still 1947.

It was absolutely lovely in there. And Ro and I used to take acid and wander around and look at all the pretty ladies who worked there. Yeah. So men who torture, murder, and rob. Okay.

We're gonna need some criminals. Oh, Finley and Brady, they're pretty criminal. We'll have them. No. No.

What rhymes with Robs? Oh, Harding and Hobbs. Mhmm. Well, they're completely innocent people. Let's throw them in with some bloody morse murderers.

So there you have it. Not really criminals at all. No. Their lawyers didn't spot it. And then I mentioned I listed You know what?

If they have closed down, I hope to Christ it's not our fault. I mentioned water like the, water. Yeah. What can be said about what a great deal does it happens? You know, it's a true story.

Right? No. I know it's about elephants. But Alright. I'm I've I've got the evidence right here.

The elephant in question lived in the Soviet Union in what is now Kazakhstan. The elephant's name was Batyr, b a t y r, Batyr. My mother discovered this story reading some newspaper or other, And she alerted me to it, and then I sort of picked up the papers and sort of got on it and read it for myself. There's a farm in Kazakhstan where, they had an elephant. I guess, you know, probably drag logs around or help out on the farm.

Haven't got a tractor. Don't need one. Go on, elephant. Thanks. It's like the old story about the Fisher space pen, isn't it?

The the Americans So there's this elephant on this farm, and they love this elephant, the people. They love him very much, and they talk to him as you would. And they sing they say things like, ah, Badir. Good elephant. Good elephant.

And, obviously, one of the things that they were saying around the elephant a lot was, has the elephant had any water? And it goes without saying, obviously. They're not saying this in English. At night, alone in the barn, the elephant is discovered, chuntering to himself, making human noises. And what he's saying, it's a bit like a parrot.

He is saying the things that he's heard around him. And the elephant says, good elephant. Good elephant. What? Has the elephant had any water?

Because he must have heard them say that to each other a thousand times. Right? Word got out. Scientists came from Moscow with tape recorders and all the rest of it. And sure enough, they had it on tape.

Elephant. Good elephant. What? The evidence, whereof I speak, is in later years, Kazakhstan issued a stamp with a picture of Batir on it. I have a copy of the stamp.

So it's all a true story. And I was ruminating on this one day. And this is really the biggest mystery about the whole song. Not that there's a talking elephant and that there is proof. No.

Not that. The real mystery of this is that I wrote this song while waiting for a bus on the way home from work at the law office. Only, I have a very, very vivid memory of being at a bus stop, not on Bridge Street as you would expect, Nor yet at the bus stop where I got off on the way to Shuttlanger. No. I wrote this song at a bus stop in Blisworth.

What I was doing in Blisworth, I will never know. But I got the idea for the song. Now I got the bus, and from my bus stop, as previously advertised, from my bus stop to home was another sort of mile and a half walk. And on that mile and a half walk, I quite often used to sort of, like, pull lyrics together and pass the time. You know?

And, yeah, by the time I got home, all I had to do was pick up the guitar and record it. It was it was finished. Because it's not the most complicated song in the world. But it speaks the truth, and people respond to that. Also, I do and I really like sitting there going and seeing just how long we could push it before the otter comes out.

Lost in France is listed, but it's not written by you, obviously. No. I don't know why it is listed, really, on in the in the list of songs, but it is. Gunfire and Pianos. In 1985, the great Mick Mercer, who wrote for the Melody Maker and who was the editor of Zig Zag, I think it was a Zig Zag sponsored thing.

He made a compilation LP called Gunfire and Pianos. And who's on that? Psychic TV are on that. The Membranes are on that. The Pastels are on that.

And Mick got in touch and said, do you wanna do something on that? I said, sure. And in the ensuing conversation, we had a bit of a laugh. And I said, yeah. I'm gonna do Lost in France by Bonnie Tyler.

Mick went, go on then. So I did. And, you know, we were talking about, how music for a new society was an important record in our lives. Well, when I went into Bugbrook with old Malcolm River Garnac to record this version of, Lost in France, I decided that I would record it in the fashion of music for new society. So the song is stripped of its clothes, flayed in places to the bone.

The click track remains running through the whole thing really loud with an echo on it, and it ends with the sound of me literally flinging the acoustic across the room. You never heard it? Yeah. You have heard it? Yeah.

Then you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. That absolutely. It's a little bit the same methodology, I suppose.

Dave Jay and I were both kind of into this. And, you know, I wanted to sort of, like, destroy the song and just just get to the sort of emotional car crash that is at the heart of it. And, of course, round about that same time was the the the series of dates out at Puckbrook where Dave and I went to record his version of, The Part is Over. Yes. And, again, you've talked about getting increasingly drunk, but not drunk enough.

That's That's right. He kept phoning up and going, you know, I've been listening. Not drunk enough. Yeah. And we keep going back.

Well, it's that time. Yeah. So it's that it's that sort of similar sort of methodology. It's like, let's let's really get to the heart of this by smashing it to pieces with a mallet. Deconstruct it until it's in pieces on the lawn.

Yeah. Until there's no hope of putting it back together again. It's the sort of thing you know, you hear you hear horror stories about customs officers who have the right to dismantle your car in the road, and not under any obligation to put it back together again if they find you innocent. And, you know, you're always hearing these stories on the road about somebody who had their bus reduced to the last nut and that were just left there. I don't I don't think those stories are necessarily I'm I'm not sure that they've got quite as much truth in them as the story of Batty, the talking elephant, to be honest.

But the theory is there. Death dentist. We were walking. Yeah. We were walking past, do you know that you must be familiar with the multidimensional roundabout over by Abington Park, where Abington Avenue comes down, Park Avenue North comes down, Millie Road goes off, the road to the M 1 goes off.

Yeah. We were just walking along there one night. There was me. There was Princess Alice, possibly Ida or Rolo. And we were making our way from my house on Birchfield Road to the Abington Public House where, almost scarcely, credibly, we used to drink at the time.

And we passed the dentist's office. And, you know, everyone's jabbering. And I don't quite know how it happens, but somebody says, sex dentist. And everyone's laughing, and I'm going, yeah. Well, we can't we can hardly have that, can we, on account of, you know, sex engine.

We can't really do sex dentist as well. People just think we got sex on the bloody brain. And in the remaining two two hundred and fifty yards to get to the APH, I thought but on the other hand, if you were to do a sort of what's that film called? You know the one I mean. Is it safe?

Is it the boys in Hoffman? Yeah. Is it the boys from Brazil? Is that the one? Marathon.

Marathon, man. Yeah. So yeah. Marathon, man. Yeah.

Yeah. You know, it doesn't it doesn't take much to, spark that into your head when it's 1982 or '83. So immediately, you know, that's it, isn't it? Oh, what's art about? Oh, sex and death.

Well, we've done sex, so it better be death dentist. Oh, that's got a nice ring to it. Yeah. Oh, if only we could get the supremes to go, he's going to get you. No.

No. No. I'm afraid that me and Max being the supremes actually comes out more like me and Max being Banana Rama, but there you go. And one of the most interesting musical ideas about death dentists and let's face it. There aren't many.

Was in the middle, in the instrumental section, you've got sort of, like, eight bars of that little rising guitar figure. And I just doing his Steve Barrett impressions. He's just kinda like making weird little crackly noises on his guitar over the top. And then it goes mental. And it's a little bit hard to work out what you're listening to.

Here's the thing. It's a drum solo. But it's a drum solo like a guitar solo. That is to say the rest of the music doesn't stop. Normally, people do a drum solo.

Everything stops. Everybody goes off stage and has a line of cocaine. And this poor Burke is left there trying to remember where he came where he came in. Wondering if his band are gonna come back or if they'll just go, oh, we'll just have another line. Shall we, lads?

You know? Drum solo on its own. We thought, oh, why don't you just do it like a guitar solo and just like well, you know, we'll do the track with the proper drums, and then you'd have a drum solo over the top of the proper drums. That's why it sounds like that because that's exactly what's happening. The monster that is the devil is my friend.

Yes. Which is, you know, seriously much more popular than you ever imagined it would be, I guess. Oh, god. And and I listened to a I think a live it might be on the website where there's, there's a tape of live recording where it sounds like the crowd are going absolutely mental. It's like, you know.

But did I ever tell you about the riot in, Ottawa? Don't think so. Okay. Well, this this is not really to do with music, but it's definitely to do with The Devil is My Friend. Played a gig in a place called Barrymore's Theatre in Ottawa in Canada.

It would have been the eighty eight tour. We had Kizzy on guitar, Paul and Lawrence in the rhythm section, and myself. And played the it's a beautiful old theater. I noticed early on, they had photographs of people who played there in the in the backstage area. And there was John Kale.

There was Miles Davis. There was Dolly Parton. Some big stars have played this theater. And it was a big old theater. It hold about, I suppose, 800 people, a thousand people perhaps.

And it was heaving. And, you know, we had a lot of backing in Canada, and I suppose there's not much else to do of an evening out there. So the place was heaving, and they're very enthusiastic, and we got an encore. During the time that we're backstage at the end of the set before the encore, someone goes, boy, look. Look at these daft t shirts this bloke left us.

And this bloke has been around the dressing room, and he's left us these bootleg t shirts. And they're just plain white t shirts, but with the Jess Paulkin on. Just white T shirts with a little pink piggy going in the middle of your chest. Now it's possible that drink and or drugs had been involved at this point, but or maybe we were just high on life after being clapped at by a load of overexcited Canadians. I can't say, but we thought it would be funny if we went back out for the encore, all wearing these shirts.

And so we did. Four pasty little English twats in matching pathetic white bootleg t shirts come back and take the stage. Somebody goes, the devil is my friend. Somebody else goes, the devil is my friend. Within about twenty or thirty seconds, we've got 800 Canadians stamping their little feet, clapping their little hands, going, the devil is my friend.

The devil is my friend. The devil is my friend. Four pathetic, pasty white boys pawned the stage in these laughable t shirts and 800 Canadians chanting like a football match or something. All chanting and stamping and going, the devil is my friend. Now this was at the time when Tipper Gore, Al Gore's wife, was doing her sort of campaign against terrible satanic music lyrics and all this kind of thing.

And I stood there, Fender El Rio hanging limply around my waist as I just stared in astonishment at this frankly quite frightening scene. The walls of the place were, like, shaking with this. Honestly, I cannot it was physical. It was palpable because they were all doing it. And I stood there with that guitar hanging off me, my arms limp at my sides, gaping at this spectacle.

And just thinking, oh, dear god. If only Tiburon could see this. And then, of course, we were obliged to play it. The Devil is My Friend was tacked on to the, human jungle sessions and came out as a kind of seaside on the 12 inch. And we hadn't Dave knew that we were recording human jungle for the a side, and he knew that we were gonna do death dentist for b side.

He had no idea that we were going to record The Devil is My Friend. The only time that anyone had really heard The Devil is My Friend being sung, there were never any instruments. It was just some drunken thing that you come back from the pub shouting it on your way home to go and smoke some drugs. It was just a stupid little joke like the elephant man or something like that. But while we were at Woodbine with John, we thought, let's stick it down for a laugh.

So Dave Barker shows up at the end of the session, and it's been a long session. God knows what it's costing because Woodbine's not a cheap place. Dave Barker shows up. Right. Let's what have you done?

And rather than playing the a side or death dentist, the first thing we played him was he's my friend. Dave sat through it, his face turning progressively grayer, and the thing finished. Dave looked at me and Max, and he went, oh, that's stupid. Laughing our heads off, we were compelled to agree. Yes.

Yes. It's very stupid. Sorry, Dave. Sorry. We squandered, like, $2 of your money recording this nonsense, but we've done it now.

And, yeah, Dave was really quite he quite got the hump about it, and you can't really blame him. But then somebody put it on that bloody nonsense compilation that introduced us to North America. And I think I may have made remarks about this before with reference to La Mer and My Desert, But it seems to me that nobody ever went broke taking the piss out of a country's national folk music. Because this brutally cynical, dismissive, stupid attempt at country in western. I mean, you you can kind of tell how the band feels about country in western by what they've done with it.

You know? It somehow just locked in the imagination of young eighties America. I suppose it was one of those terrible mistakes, like big hair and mullets and things like that. But, yeah, it just locked in. And oh, boy.

Oh, boy. The the Barrymore Theatre one is the night that we all remember, but there were scenes like that right across the continent. Yes. So it's, it's consciously stupid. And then Yeah.

Thousands of people embrace the stupidity of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who would have ever imagined that people in America would do a thing like that? I quite like the, the the this is this is the time when the Soviets, Russians were were getting through a a leader every few months.

Yeah. And Deirdre Puffy just popped off. Yes. There was a kind of vodka at the time, cheap vodka. And in those days, we had no discernment about what we ate or drank, really.

And, we just buy what was cheap and effective. And you could get this vodka that probably came from, like, Scumthorpe or something called Popoff, p o p o v. And, you know, you'd be sitting there glugging this from the bottle in a phone box thinking, pop off. Because when you drink it, you do. And so, inevitably, poor old Andropov.

He's just Yep. And I quite like a idiot. I mean You know what I mean? That is the voice. Hang on a minute.

Just a minute here. This is messing with the whole picture. Because that no. No. It's not the voice of Dave Parker.

I was thinking, how would Dave be surprised and disgusted if he put his voice on it? But he hadn't. It was Phil, our road manager, doing an impression of Dave. That's what that was. Yeah.

But you know what I mean? I I just I like the fact that it's a bit of a punchline, isn't it? You know, everyone's your friend, but if you look just someone they make the point. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, you wouldn't wanna be friends with Idi Amin. He'd eat you. Is I mean, that is you know, there's there's a certain class of person, isn't there? I call them turners. And you start off having a jolly evening, and then they put down one pint too many, and they just become a nightmare.

I feel that edi amine falls into that category, and I'm not sure he even needed the extra pint. Yeah. I was sort of experiencing that at 11:00 in the morning, this morning in Wetherspoon. This this is before the roof blew off. I took my, son my eldest son for for breakfast.

It's it's a new thing of mine. Weather Weatherspoon's breakfast, they did quite a nice veggie, all ink fully full English veggie. And you Why don't you I tell you what. Why don't you just go without breakfast and give the money directly to Nigel Farage? Because that's where it's going.

Witherspoons, are you joking me? And That guy's a Tim Tim idiot who runs Witherspoons, the one who looks like father Jack. He is right in there with Aaron Banks and all that mob. And 08:00 in the morning, you can have a drink, and they and they are. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, there are many reasons to avoid Wetherspoons. For me, the number one is a political one. But, also, people in Witherspoons. Yeah.

Yeah. And they won't serve any foreign beer. It's all got to be British beer for British people. Fuck Witherspoon's. Let's put that in the book.

In fact, let's call the book Fuck Witherspoon's, the Jazz Butcher's Story. You don't mind you don't mind the swearing there? That will be appropriate and selected, particularly. Absolutely. Fuck where the cow, please, can we call it that?

Sorry. You were trying to tell me something about your breakfast. I beg your pardon. Nice breakfast. And, but I'm not as politically aware of, as about the pub as you are, obviously.

And, and, yes, people were getting, you know, drunk. Yep. Drunk by midmorning because they can be drinking from me. That's all. Because they can.

Yeah. It's like England where the sun comes out, and all fat men feel compelled to remove all upper body clothing and immediately start drinking Stella. What a shit place. Well, you hate Britain. Yes.

I do. We mentioned the performance of Hard at the tube or the tube. Didn't really talk much about this song. No. It's a silly song.

I quite like the old fake bank snake in her boyfriend's cake. But, yeah, I was in a funny frame of mind at the time. Yeah. It's the beginning of '86, isn't it? Yes.

It is. It's the beginning of eighty six. And, Yeah. It's it's for me, it's not particularly successful tune. It's a single?

Someone decided that's it's good enough to put it out as a single. Yeah. I'm not quite I think yeah. I mean, there I think possibly it was one of those ones where the demo was sufficiently badly recorded that it sounded kinda cool. Do you know what I was saying about, this modern thing of nothing left to chance and golden signal?

The magic surely lies actually in things getting fucked up and mashed up. I think it might have been a case where, like, the pathetic bedroom demo had that effect and made it sound like a better song than it was. Because when you got it under the clinical eye of Livingston Studios, which is a very dry, clean kind of studio, I don't think really the riffage kinda held up particularly well. Also, I didn't like the glockenspiel they had there. Didn't like the glockenspiel they had there one bit.

It didn't have proper sustain on it. I don't it it it looked really good. It looked like concert quality, but perhaps it was just, perhaps it was just the mallets we were using. I don't know. But it didn't I love the sound of the glockenspiel on Scandal in Bohemia, for example, which was only a little educational one about JABIC.

Couple of octaves. And the this was a a big old thing, you know, like a concert thing, but it just didn't have that resonance or sustain. A minor car, it has to be said. The engineer, Tony Harris, is a great bloke. He was really nice to work with.

But So is it like a one off recording, was it? Sorry? This This is a one off recording, just this song on its own or Well, we did a session to make the whole 12 inch. So we did that. We did party time.

We did grooving in the bus lane. I think that's probably just those three, I think. But you see, there's a thing with Livingston Studios, and we're not alone in this. It does your recordings there do somehow seem to come out very clean and dry. The weather profits, Piazza spent, made a record there for, this short lived Elevation thing, which was like Warner's Money and Alan McGee's A and R.

They made an album called Mayflower, and they they made that there. And they came away very disappointed feeling that it had come out somehow a lot flatter and a lot less rock than they actually sounded. REM recorded there around about the same time. I forget which album it might be fable of sort of the reconstruction, but I'm not that familiar with their work. But, again, I remember talking to Peter Buck about Livingstone, and he said, again, they felt that their stuff came out a bit dry.

So maybe the riff wasn't so bad, and it was just the the Livingstone factor. Or maybe, as I suspect, the riff just wasn't up to that much. It wasn't really capable of carrying the tune. There's a chance to go mental at the end there when you're playing it out loud because you did it on the tune. Yeah.

Yeah. And I I think we talked, didn't we, about how Jules Holland seems to take this as some kind of personal affront. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it was it was a jolly enough thing to play.

I mean, it it went over alright live as a general rule. But I can't I can't say I'm particularly fond of it as a as a song. The best the best thing on that EP is Vienna song, for my money. The version of Party Time was nice. We thought we should rerecord it because like that first version, you know, it's very compared to what was happening at the gigs, it was like a demo, really.

And old Ian Sturgis going walkabout on the bass as well. We just thought it would be worth recording it as we were now, you know, as the JBC. Yeah, that's that's nice. There's nothing wrong with that. And as I say, Tony was a smasher to work with, but there's something about that limit the Livingstone Place.

And it didn't just happen to us. You know? It it doesn't it somehow sounds as though it's not a big expensive 24 track, but sort of like a a boxy 16 track or something. I don't know. It's actually I mean, it's a really luxurious state of the art studio, but it's just something maybe it's just eighties recording techniques.

I don't know. Listed a couple of tracks from the spooky EP, Blame and Whitfield, Sarah, and the Birchfield Road Affair. Whitfield, Sarah, and the Birchfield Road Affair was literally made up on the spot. That's why I keep saying nothing at all all the time. Because it is nothing at all.

Literally made up on the spot for a Canadian radio session, CBC nineteen eighty '8. Kizzy, bless him, had got himself into a state and condition. What had happened, if I remember correctly, we'd got fixture congestion. And on the day that we were due to do this recording at the CBC in Montreal, I'd been double booked to go and do an hour or two's guest DJing on a local radio station. So we got in to the CBC.

We got established. And, pretty much immediately, it was time for me to split. So I said, well, look, guys. You know? Take your time.

Get a sound up. All that sort of thing. That all takes time. And, you know, once once you're ready to go, we're a band on tour. In the middle of a tour, we've been on tour all year, basically.

And, one thing that you do routinely at Soundcheck's is once you've got all the instruments up one by one, you play a song without the singing. So we were really good at that. We could play all our set without me singing them just for a nice instrumental balance, and then you add the vocals. You know? That's gig stuff.

So I had every confidence that they'd be able to bang out a version of, for example, Big Saturday was on the list, Grateful Annalette. That the young team would be able to bash those out. I'd go on the radio and be a bleeding personality, come back, and put the singing on. Donald. Well, I went away, went on the radio, came back to find kids face down on the studio floor, and Paul Lawrence sitting there and sort of and what are we to do now?

Sort of expression on their faces. So what we had to do then was just, like, fucking get busy and make stuff. And that's basically I can't remember if he sort of revived Kiss and got him onto some of the tracks or not, but it's basically a three piece made that made those songs. And, yeah, Sarah and Whitfield, Sarah was just made up. It was an idea that was running around in the back of my head for a possible short story.

And I couldn't really remember the short story, and I got all these looking at at me. And I've got headphones on, and I'm supposed to do something to the track now. So that's the music was just made up arbitrarily. Just jammed it out. And then the words just logorrhea over the top.

It's nothing. It's a puff. Similar thing happened, though, at the same session that was a lot more useful. Thinking that we're a bit light on stuff and not really knowing where to go, I sat down on my own and played this little tune, Girl Go. And that's for again, that was made up on the spot.

That was made up there in that room that night. And, of course, that went on to, have got a distinguished career in, in midfield. Blame? There was a night in Stuttgart on the eighty eight European tour in the spring where we had a night off in the Stuttgart hotel with the gig was the next day. And, we were just carousing, passing a leisurely evening with the old and so when we became excited because two coaches pulled up with Soviet plates and disgorged large numbers of grim faced Soviet Russians into the hotel.

Well, you didn't see too many Soviet Russians in Western Europe in AE 8. We grew excited, and we tried to communicate with our fellow socialists from across the divide. And just like they tell you in all those sort of dismissive documentaries where they lie through their teeth about all these different things, one one thing that they did have right was all the roosties were dead scared of talking to us. Now I'm not sure that that was because we were westerners. I think it may have had a lot to do with the fact that they'd probably never seen white people who looked like us before and were probably alarmed at our level of excitement and interest in their doings.

It's like, bloody hell. These these West German spots don't have look funny. So there we were chasing all these rooskis around the hotel. And, of course, into the bargain getting progressively drunker and stoned her. And I didn't witness it at the time.

I wasn't around. Yeah. Never mind what I was up to. In the room which Steve Malloy, our justice and security department, was sharing, There had been some excitement, and, one of the beds had gone out the window. I know traditionally, it's supposed to be televisions.

Right? But Steve's a big strong man. There's a reason we used to call him monster boy. And, yeah, somehow or other, a bed ended up going out the window. And I I think I still, somewhere, have a photograph of the aftermath with, like, Malloy, possibly Mulraney, or possibly Lawrence, one of the two, and some random German punky bird all piled on top of each other in the remaining bed in the morning.

And, of course, there was there was some there were reductions with the, with the establishment. As if we look at what form my bed is in the car park, that sort of thing. And, it was about that time that Mulraney came up with a brilliant plan. Oh, don't blame us. Blame me on the Libyans.

And so blame me on the Libyans became a right catchphrase. The little riff, the little five four riff, I think it owed a lot to Richard Formby, actually. Yeah. Richard did a thing just on a cassette, not not for release. Just did a thing, which is really sort of quite clean and major key and melodic.

But it had that five, ten, eight, if you like, thing. And, I kinda remembered it. And my idea, frankly, when we got into do the b side for Spooky at Greenhouse with her Higgins, my idea was to take that and, like, hang things off of that riff. But pretty much as soon as we started to play it, Paul just went into this, like, hyper sort of groovy, almost like a sort of five four drum and bass kind of deal. And, of course, Lawrence went chasing after him.

Because those two at that point, they were playing together every night. They were telepathically connected. And so the next thing I know, these guys are steaming away like a greyhound out of a trap. Kizzy's got the first tone on it. It's just going.

And any attempt to introduce Richard's pretty little riff, it's gone. Now in one way, this is good because it means we get the writing credit. But in another way, it's like, oh, well, now what's happening? And so the thing ran away, and it took on a life of its own. And, yeah, it was just well, it needs a lyric, and it's like, don't blame it on me.

Blame it on the Lippians. It just sat really well. And the the versey bits, it was '88. It was the summer. It was the twentieth anniversary of chucking rocks in gay Paris.

They were situationist riots. And so we hung the thread on that. On the idea of, like, the, you know, French people writing in the streets. And, just ran it from there, really, lyrically. Just ran it from there.

You know, things are getting out of hand. Things that I don't understand. Somebody caught rabies. You know? Just escalating paranoia.

Nice little breakdown. Little just pull Larry Larry holding it back. Like, he's just fuzzing. Nice little breakdown. And some really shitty Casio Istanbul traffic jam noises at the end from yours truly.

Yeah. I like I like blame. We did a version of that for the CBC session as well, which I don't think was really radically different from, the b side version. I can't it didn't get played a lot. I can't recall playing it out at gigs very much.

Though he might have done once or twice. Beautiful snow white hair, which is about O'Higgins. Yeah. That was a a long tour and a very mental one. Nine weeks, I think, in total, and it was hot.

And, at some point, Higgins, he's he's a very entertaining soul. He's he's a clever man, and sometimes he can do these very clever wind ups. I think it was on that same tour that he had a photograph of his newly born baby. And this photograph of his newly born baby was a horror photograph. The baby was being changed.

There was baby dump everywhere. The baby's sort of lying there with his legs in the air and trucking just a sea of baby dump. And what O'Higgins would do, he'd be having a drink with someone, or worse, he would do it at the dinner table. And say, oh, yes. Well, she's beautiful.

She's beautiful. Would you like to see a picture? And people go, oh, yes. Because you know what people like when someone has a baby. They're all fussy and congratulatory.

And, oh oh, yes. Oh, yes. It'd be lovely to see a picture of little Isabelle. Yes. No dickens would pull out this horror go to chrome job.

You know, they they they chose this particular color in Australia from the whole Pantone selection. They chose this particular color to to put on cigarette packets because it was supposed to be the most unattractive color available. Incorrect. I have seen the most unpleasant color available, and it was in O'Higgins's baby photograph. And so occasionally, omnibus conversations would that was the you know what?

The whole photograph business was 88. This, however, is 92. But baby talk would go on.

And one day, out of the blue, Higgins announced to general public without much fanfare. When I was a little baby, I used to have beautiful snow white hair. Well, occasionally, remarks would be made. Because I part part of the fun with O'Higgins is just being horrible to him. And, yeah, tart remarks would be made about beautiful snow white hair or someone would go, oi, snowy, or so forth.

And we got to the very last night of the tour, which was in a place called The Knick in Birmingham, Alabama. Hadn't been to Alabama before. You hear a lot about Alabama, don't you? You hear a lot about Birmingham, Alabama because that's where they shot fucking Martin Luther King, wasn't it? We just had an insane two and a half days in New Orleans, the Chilton Binge.

And we had to drive up to Alabama. We were all feeling a little bit fragile, and we're all feeling a little bit scared. And the Nick turned out to be a sort of large log cabin on the edge of town with, like, rather impressive motorcycles parked outside. Chicken wire. We weren't that panicked because Alex had said that he was gonna come up.

And we thought, well, if anyone can protect us in Birmingham, Alabama, it will be Alex children. We'll be alright. So we went in, tea time for a sound check, and sure enough, rednecks. You know, sort of Elvis Presley hairdos, the black shirts, the denim, rednecks. They didn't really pay us much mind.

We didn't really pay them much mind. It's a bit like alligators. You just everyone gets on with it. You know? It might have been a vague flicker of interest when the barman said, "we got a Pat Fish here?"

Yep. "I got Alex Chilton on the phone for you." I think one or two of them might have, like an eyebrow might have gone up a sixteenth of an inch. You know? And it was Alex on the dog, and he was going, like, I'm fucked.

I'm not coming up tonight. I said, that's cool. It was great seeing you. Bye. Went back to doing a sound check.

Rednecks everywhere. Can't even remember what we had for dinner, but I don't remember leaving the nick or going to a restaurant or anything. I think we probably just got, like, you know, carry out pizza or some kind of muck like that. And this is the last night of the tour. Right?

So it's not it's not shaping up too great. You know, we've done two shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles. We've done two shows with Jeff Buckley in New York. We've done Vancouver. We've done Chicago.

And now we're in this wooden shed in a city that has a rather scary and hostile reputation with a few rednecks at the bar while we're trying to soundcheck. Alex isn't coming. It's all a bit the potential is there for disappointment. Couple of spliffs in the car park. Wait.

What? Why don't we start tonight with a jam? What? Well, they're all rednecks. They won't be listening.

You know, I mean, this could be pointless. Why don't we just have some fun? And instead of starting off with, like, party time or something, why don't we just get up there and have a massive great one called Jam? Yeah. Right?

Yeah. You alright? Brilliant. Dave Whittemore was there, the website guy, with his little spaceship sports car type thing. And being the Internet crazy guy that he was, just general sort of sound scientist kind of chap, in his little spaceship car.

He'd somehow set up the capacity to broadcast. So he was he put his mics up. He'd been taping loads of the shows on that tour as Western Family prooves. And he set up his mics and actually sort of turned his car into a tiny radio station with a reach of about two or three miles. So we weren't just playing to the punters who turned up.

They turned up in reasonable numbers, actually. Didn't look too scary. But also broadcasting to anyone who's in the area, which is why there's a crack at the very top of that sort of I forget exactly what I say, but it's like, oh, you're on the radio. You wanna get down to Nick, my son? And it's literally the first song in the set.

It's literally Birmingham, Alabama. They are the rednecks that were there at tea time are still there, still drinking amongst the hipsters. And we start off with a shapeless one quart jam that lasts about seven minutes and concludes with me chanting, Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. I thought, well, in for a penny, in for a dollar.

You know? Not the slightest problem. Not the slightest problem. Played through the whole set. Increasingly warm applause.

Finished the set. Having a quiet drink. Uh-oh. Here comes one of the rednecks. This is a bit this is you know, everything's gone so smooth, and here comes a redneck.

You boys? You boys lack of breath, fresh air. Oh, that's very nice of you. And then he turns to Crouchy, and he goes Crouchy, he was, like, almost static on stage. Right?

Just plays. Turns around to Crouchy. He goes, you need to calm down, little son. So that is the story of beautiful Snow White Hero. It's basically an attempt to see if we could get ourselves shot.

And, you know, when all else failed, I tried the old. But, in the middle of it, we lift massively Spaceman 3 number, which is why the writing credits on there are so complicated because their writing credits were complicated enough. And then we sort of added stuff around it. But, yeah, I I rather like the version of Amen in the middle.

And you mentioned, German for in basket or something.

Yes. Yes. This is very in joke. On the autumn ninety one tour around Germany and Austria with Pete Astor, We stopped it may even have been the same shopping trip where we bought the wooden parrots on sticks. I bought a little card game whose exact nature was unclear because it was in German.

But it was a bit like happy families, and they were like suits of cards, all of which had pictures of puss cats on them. There was raub cats and predator cats. They had, like, leopards and tigers and lions, and there was, like, pears and with lots of long, woolly haired Persian cats. What was it? Oh, spiel something or the kitchen.

One of the sections was like playful kittens. Can't remember the word spiel something kitchen. And in this suite, there were, like, four cards. One was, which is a little puss cat with a huge slice of, like, Viennese cake with cream all over its mush. There was another one which caused endless amusement on the bus of a little shabby kitten with a plastic toy telephone.

And the immortal caption, telephone. My own telephone. This caused utter delight. And there was a further suit of four cards, which was kittens in baskets. And this was entitled, Imcorp.

So when Higgins was a baby, they kept him in a basket, so he lived Imcorp. And that's what that is. You can honestly, I mean, like, probably, like, £1.50 for a little card game. You've got no idea how much joy and amusement it brought us. Getting towards the bottom of this list of 12.

Excellent. Is is that from the basement sessions? So it's a go go b side, is it? Yes. That was, that was indeed from the basement sessions, and that marks the last recorded appearance of poor old kids before he goes down.

We managed to get a little bit of heavy metal guitar out of him. And, also, we got him just for one breakdown on his own just going, excellent. That's kiss. Yeah. Poor guy.

He got a trench in his head. He was fucking medicated off his chump. He didn't know what was going on, but we got that out of him. But that that that is his last yeah. That's his drug band Blues, God of Us.

Yeah. Awful times. Awful times. But the song itself, it was, I suppose, the result of a sort of survey. We took the instruction book for the, for the album that we had with us, and we just started writing down things that we liked.

It's as simple as that. It's just a list of things that we could use a case of. And the lyric gets passed around proper rap style. You know, different people get different lines. And I find Mulraney particularly very convincing.

There's there's almost a touch of the endures when he goes, Camel filters in the box. So yeah. I mean, it was I don't think there was ever any intention of putting it on the album, but it's hard to say because, you know, I'd we've said before with the whole thing with Basement, we were after sprawling. And there are things that were gonna be recorded that I can remember that never got recorded. Like the little, the little sort of do what chorus of.

Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.

Love. Love. Little things like that. They've never even made it to tape, but excellent obviously did. And right at the end, you just hear Richard Formby's only vocal contribution.

It just goes to Giles Gilbert Scott 1926 g series public telephone kiosk With that same tone of satisfaction that you hear from Ida when he goes, drum bone. It's like, yes. We've got it on the record. And lastly, vodka girls. Everything in this world is cheap and nasty.

Everything in this world is cursed and vile. It's called vile's sister, Kirsten. It was done at the Love Bus sessions. It was one of the four that didn't make it onto Love Bus, wasn't it? There was that.

There's cat brand meditation. There was I never know when to say when, which was uncle Dave's birthday present. And there was an initial version of Trucco Fear. Oh, and there were also covers of Everybody's Talking and Over the Rainbow as well. Well, we were there for a long time.

I don't really know what to say about Vodka Girls. The it's it it has things in common with killed out from that session. In the rather than playing chords or tunes on the guitars, it's just like it's a bit more Jackson Pollock than that. It's just like throwing guitar noise at the track and just splattering it in sort of hostile guitars. Yeah.

I'm blowing up my ugly balloon Round at Richard's one night after work, getting high, and looking at his Minnie the Minx annual. And one of the cartoons began with Minnie blowing up this balloon, and she goes, alright, readers? I'm blowing up my ugly balloon. A few good blows, and I can have some laughs. So that's where that's lifted from.

It's a song of general hostility towards are you familiar with Bridge Street of a Friday night? But, presumably, you've seen shows on telly of, like, drunk birds with their knickers around their ankles, throwing up on policemen on Cardiff High Street. That sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah.

There's that line, Rope like Fergie Rope like something. Fergie and a nightmare. Cardboard hair. And REM, good god. It was a time when REM had started having hits.

Like, they were losing their religion and so forth. And, you would see, you know, these these these pissed up girls in mini dresses with cardboard sort of Carol Decker hair. And, you know, REM would be playing, and and and they'd be slight sloshing about with their brightly colored alcopops, and you would just be left culturally confused. I came to the conclusion that one good thing to do would be just to, like, detonate the thing. So, of course, at the end of the song, that's exactly what we do.

You can practically hear the plunger go down. And, again, Richard Formby and the, Rosemary Davis series hard at work there. As the explosion goes off, we dropped in, the sound of, polite applause from a county cricket match. And, also a couple of sheep. A good match.

Yeah. Yeah. But it yeah. It's just just one of those sort of it has things in common with, say, Chicken Town. It's just screaming abuse at people for being vulgar, which is quite funny, really, because screaming abuse is quite vulgar.

And that concludes, if we have to write a concordance, the, 208 or whatever I said there was. 208. Okay. I've got you. I've got you straight away.

We didn't cover thing, which lurks on the end of the hard EP. And we didn't cover City of Night, which is on 50,000 glass fence. Can't be wrong. Possibly not. Yeah.

Did we do a session on Gift of Music volume two? Big question, No. Because if we did, we might have covered some of these there. Yeah. Quite tricky to search for thing.

Try City of Night. That's pretty, pretty easy to pull up. I'll make you another cup of tea. Yeah. City of Night, I think.

You got something on that? Yeah. City of Night would sit on that as well. Sorry? I'm saying, sir, you said earlier City of the City of Night began as an instrumental very much along the lines of Monkeyface Yep.

On the four track. So we have covered it? Yeah. It was never it was never on four track. I'll cut you up at, Bugbrook.

Raul has developed a slightly more complicated, title. Thank you. Really? Yeah. A little while ago, I finally bit the bullet, plugged the power supply into Russell's drum machine, and watched to see if it would blow up or break everything, and it didn't.

So shortly thereafter, I got it wired up to the four track and started running little, experimental little jams. Your man here got up on the desk, and the drum machine was running, but it was coming out through headphones. And I caught him up against the headphones going, what's that? So I opened him up for him so he could hear it. And he's like, oh, what's that?

So it's drums. Look. The drums come out of that box there, go down this wire, they go through that, and they come out down this one here into these. And you're hearing that thing going through there, coming out here. And he's like, very sage.

He's like, yes. And he has another little listen to the drums. Yes. He then curls up on the desk right next door to all the recording kit and stays there throughout the evening. So he's not he's no longer number one top chief assistant.

He is now, deep breath, number one top chief assistant recording engineer. Yeah. And has to be addressed thus, don't you? Yes. I do.

We have, we have the song about having sex with an hoover. That's the one. Yep. Dodges assholes. Yeah.

I mean, I was thinking in the kitchen. I was thinking all that really needs to be said about that thing is this is a song about a man having sex with a hoover. Talk about Kip. He wanted to do little dark songs like Kip and S. That's on the box of green.

Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. It has a lot in common with that because it's kind of blues based, isn't it? So, yeah, I think we covered that.

So Excellent. To my knowledge, that is 208, more or less covered in the manner that we have been covering them. I have to sort of I wanna catch you out on something. I wanna find something you've missed. So, I wanted to how long have we got?

Probably only until three in the morning because I've then gotta get up and go to London. Yeah. Briefly canter through the last eight years, if only in the manner that we have been previously to get some set some context to new songs. 2012 to now? Yes.

So Whoosh. I mentioned 2012. So we'll do it in a canter if we can. Okay. Well, Gent gents, So when when Gents events finish, you you then almost straight off or about the same time you have the Wilson DVD launch, and then you have a few other That that actually happened in the middle of making Genadvent.

That weekend with, the trip the Wilson rehearsals, the trip to Bils, doing me back in with the drum train, playing the pitch drum for the DVD release, that was all right in the middle over a weekend of the recording session. We got Genadvent finished, mastered, pressed, boxed up, and shipped to us by the end of that 02/2012. And we were rather overtaken by events because before we could even get it out, Tetsuya Nakatani over at Vinyl Japan in Tokyo said, oh, Patton Max come and play Japan. Yes. And so you remember that the whole point of making Jet an Advent was to get some adventures traveling the world.

Right? Well, it started to come true even before the thing had come out. It was enough it was enough word that people had heard that we were recording again. It was obviously enough to get the Japanese fans up and going. And so we went over there, which is very agreeable.

The next year, what happened, I just Solo in Brussels. Brussels. Yeah. And Hamburg and Dortmund with with Truax, all of those. Ah, now that that's small beast.

That's that's entirely its own thing. God. That's a chapter of its own. That is Small Beast was the brainchild of Paul Wolfish. Have we talked about Paul?

Very interesting man. Comes from a very, very musical family. One of his elderly female relatives played cello for her life in Auschwitz. I've started to think of the news recently, obviously, with this seventy fifth Auschwitz thing, about a cellist who is still alive, I think. Lady cellist?

Yeah. Could well be Paul's auntie, grandma, whatever she is. Could well be. But the whole family had, like, obscenely musical. Dad was like or is like some kind of famous conductor or something, and Paul can play everything.

And he's very well connected. At this time in 02/2013, he was the musical director at the Schauspiel House in Dortmund, which is how we got to play there. But he had this club called Small Beast, and every month he would invite in a guest artist and then sort of build a show around. Yes. I'm listening.

I was just looking up Anita Laska Valfish. Yeah. She's the cellist. Yeah. Yeah.

They're Romanian Jews originally. She's still alive. 94 years old. Yeah. Wow.

Yeah. Well, that that's that's some relation, of course. And, yeah, I mean, he is effectively a Romanian Jew from New York, but he spends a lot of time traveling the world doing various music projects because he's a hell of an instrumentalist. He was there, when we were trying to record Mickey in Prague. Dave Jay got him over.

And so this club, he has small beast guest artist every month. And in fact, the month before us, he'd had Dave Jay. And then he got in touch with me, and he said, listen. I wanna do something a little different for Small Beast. I wanna get you and Truax and Marcus Maria Janssen from this German band, m Walking on the Water, who I knew we'd do it together before.

And I want to build an imaginary band called the Almost Hasbings. And so we did. I went over there about a week before his dates. We had a date in Hamburg, and we had a date in Dortmund. And we went over there.

And in a week, we invented a set for this imaginary band. And it was flat it was mental. Absolutely mental. Marcus is a singer songwriter who plays guitar. I'm a singer songwriter who plays guitar.

Truex is a singer songwriter who builds mad instruments and plays guitar. And Paul plays the piano and guitar. Great. So we've got four people. We've got four good musicians with God knows how much professional experience behind them.

But we've got no drummer or bass player. Well, we've got Mother Superior, True Axis Machine, but that ain't gonna work on everything. And so it was spectacular. Even I got a go on the drums one. I mean, if I had to play drum and bass on the same number.

Just sitting there going boom boom boom and playing bass. Absolutely stupid. Yeah. And we just did we just did the two dates. One in Hamburg and one in Dortmund.

It was the whole thing was a little strange because in the rehearsal run up, Marcus's little brother went and died. And the trip to the venue in Hamburg took us on the road right past Little Brother's flat. So Marcus was there. His sister came to see him. And, of course, they were both in pieces.

And Marcus has this song, We'll see each other in heaven. So he carried on playing Heavy. Yeah. I mean, his solo set in Hamburg was of necessity, brief, and dark. But in the band set, we did this number.

Thomas was on the drums. Paul was on the piano. I was on the bass, and Marcus was singing and playing guitar. Fuck. That was charged.

That was really, really charged both nights. When we got back to Dortmund the second night, being the troop of the years, Marcus had kind of bust through to the other side and delivered a really charming and cheerful and entertaining set. But even so, when we did that, that same song at the end of that night, heavy. Great fun. Great heavy, dark, reasonably luxurious fun.

You take you're sparked up. I noticed from the pictures around 2013, you're wearing a suit and tie in sort of habitually at gigs around that sort of time. And It started around 02/2010. I think it probably started a gig I did in, Hoxton. But it it matters very little.

I'd seen some pictures of Dave Jay that he'd had taken publicity shots, and he got himself all suited and booted. And I thought, that looks good on a man of a certain age. And it wasn't as though I didn't have the suits. And, it was also sort of like Wilson. You know, Wilson, it really didn't matter too much what you look like in Wilson.

Though, actually, if you look at the DVD 2,009 with Wilson, I'm wearing a suit. So, you know, it's it's it's something I've always done, to be honest with you, since God since the start of the nineties. I I I used to go out and get a tour suit, like, '89, 9092. I was wearing suits back then. So I'd I'd I'd don't think that's a huge thing.

But the sort of slightly cleaner, cleaned up sort of look, yeah, that that comes around 02/2010. And, and you're you're playing some local geese again, some with a full band that featured on Gents and Bents. And then you go to New York for a couple of New York days with Max. That's right. Yeah.

And I see some pictures of some busking going on or maybe ad hoc singing in the street with guitar. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I do that quite a lot, actually. If it's a nice day and it's sound check time and there's nothing going on in there, but, you know, someone's miking something up or wiring something up or whatever, There's nothing for me to do, but I've got my guitar out of the case.

I've tuned it up. I'll just go find a quiet place and have a little strum, you know. And sometimes that quiet place is in the street. Get pennies thrown much. Punches?

Yeah. Pennies, not so much. Sometimes, though, it's like it's, you know, somebody says, oh, can we come outside and take photographs? And, again, you have your guitar. So, you know, you just end up getting photographed with the guitar.

Did you see Leto Velez's painting? I'll show that to you. It's nice. It's it's taken from a photo that was taken outside the club in Brooklyn in 02/2013, and Leto's kind of turned into a sort of digital painting. It's really kinda cool.

1314 seemed like a quiet winter, but then there were some solo dates. And then the the Jazz Butcher Well lounge quartet appear. Yes. You see the end of the end of 13. We'd you know, in a in a in a short year, we've done Japan, America, Belgium, Germany, and some English dates.

So we've largely achieved what we've wanted to do with GENTA Advent. Plus, you know, we accidentally made a good record into the bargain, so that was kinda nice. But by the end of 02/2013, that was pretty much done. And the last gig I did in 2013 was with Venus Flytrap and Kevin Hewick up in Leicester at the Musician. The Musician is what you might call a destination venue.

There's not gonna be anyone walking in off the street, not where it is. It was by this empty municipal car park on a foggy, dismal, drizzly night. And, I had something like £1.79 in my pocket. I actually had to buy half of Guinness. And I was outside the front smoking pretty much my last spliff, and there's about 10 people in the venue.

And I'm thinking, fishy, I reckon you've had your lot, son. You've been, like, around the world two or three times. You've had loads of money in good times. And, frankly, mate, if you look where if you look where you're at now, it's pretty much where you started out, playing to 10 people in some obscure provincial nowhere sort of venue. Having said that, it has to be said the Musician is actually a very nice venue and very well run.

And they didn't even complain that we didn't pull anybody. They were very nice to us. But at the time, with, like, $1.79 in your pocket, half a Guinness, and a fucking half a spliff left, watching this empty car park fail to fill up, it felt like the end. And as 2014 dawned, Russell got in touch with me, Russ Cooper, and said, oh, I have a friend. She's opening a gin parlola, and she wants me to book bands for it and that.

But I really can't be bothered. I'm too busy. Do you fancy it? And I said yes because I thought that my music making days were done, and I would need some any little way of scrambling in a few quid. So I said yes.

And I went and had a meeting with Sue, and it didn't the lady with the gin parlor, that is. And it didn't really make a lot of sense, and I didn't hold out a lot of hope. But I did put out some feelers. I put out some feelers to a drummer I knew called Steve Gruffler. I said, Jill, how do you feel about the idea of, like, playing in the corner of a gin parlor where all these fabulous idiots are ignoring what you're playing and getting paid for it?

And Steve Gruff said, well, with you, which was something I hadn't anticipated. I thought I was just a fixer here. Later that same week, I was having a joint with Steve New, And I said the same thing. Steve, you you you're the kind of guy. You're you're a musical kind of guy.

You know the jazz and that. There's there's this there's this possible gig. You might, you know, might be able to make a few bob. Anyway, well, with you, it was all it it all had that kind of strange feeling like the beginning of Wilson. It's like, why are all these people suddenly talking about playing with me?

They've never shown any interest before. You know? And, as a result of these misunderstandings, it was agreed that we'd meet around Stevie g's house at the end of the street at the barbershop and have a jam just for fun. And we did. And when the three of us were in a room together, obviously, Steve and Steve, they go way back.

They've been playing together since 1983. So they are just down. And it turns out that them and me are really good fit. And it also turns out that when I gave Stevie g a copy of Genent Event, just being sociable, that blessing me had gone and learned all the songs. So it was from the word from absolutely the first moment, it felt like a really great fit.

We just sat down and started playing things. And I remember making a crack about chemtrails, and Steve New's face just lighting up and going, chemtrails? Go on. You intrigue me. And so very, very quickly, we had a little thing going on, and we started doing it every Thursday.

We called it Thursday club. And after a few weeks, Steve said, oh, I've got this mate from the boats when he used to work on the ships. He's a trumpet player. Can I bring him down for a jam? And we went, yeah.

That turned out to be Simon Taylor. And we did a couple of gigs, and we did a couple of demo recordings at Steve's nephew's place. And it's sort of accidentally by by by the 2014, I appeared accidentally to have a whole new kind of band. And we used to rehearse in Steve's Kitchen in just, like, you know, in the terrace row. So, like, we didn't play loud.

And this ability to play very softly turned out really handy because it meant we could play anywhere. We with the first gig we did, we were at the Lamplighter upstairs. Were you there? It might have been. Yeah.

It'd have been about June 2014, and it was the it was the quartet. And we'd made up our minds that we were trying to we weren't gonna try and do the big rock show. We were gonna try and export the kitchen experience into a room with punches. And so we actually played that night without any PA. I think we did have tiny little practice amps for the guitar and the bass.

But beyond that, I was just singing out into the room. Simon was just playing his trumpet. The drums weren't mic'd up. And we we we got away with that. We we finished with a version of Quality People.

And, so it it just seemed that this thing had legs. And so we started going out more and more, and people just were people were really positive about it from all sorts. So Rolo was right into it, for example. A geyser I'd known since 1983 had us play his birthday party. Didn't know what he was ordering.

Got it delivered to his house. We did the job in his house. Big house. Yeah. Did the job in his house, And he was delighted as were all his pals.

And at the end of the night, he said to me, you know, you've had this daft name for God knows how many years. It's it's almost like you've grown into it. And so the quartet existed. And that existed up to the '18 when it just sort of evaporated. I mean, the real the real problem with it was in February 16 when Stevie Gruffalo died.

That's what really made it hard. And we tried a few things after that. We had Pat Keneally from the Lords of Time on drums for a couple of dates. Then we hooked up with Tim Harris's son, Joel Yeah. Who became, like, pretty much the regular guy for that that time.

And is indeed is still sort of a member of the continuity JBC, which is a sort of emergency emergency band that we dig out if we have to. The family rhythm section of Joel and Tim. But, yeah, it it never really quite survived the demise of Stevie because he was the heart of the group, not just musically as a drummer, but socially as well. You know, it was his place where we rehearsed, his Dolce Vita that we enjoyed, his connection with Steve New that kind of, like, glued all the relationships in the band together. And There are there are various sort of incarnations of that quartet, and it even sort of evolved into a quintet at one point in it.

And I think, so Max occasionally would join that outfit. I think on occasion, Joe might. Max had a go in the 2000 he retired. Yeah. Yeah.

The two well, yeah. They led to his retirement. It and that's that's that's what took it out of him was those dates. 2014. Simon had only just been grafted on.

So rather rudely, I insisted that he sit that out because I didn't fancy the idea of Simon freestyling his trumpet and Max with his studied guitar parts just having train crashes every three and a half seconds. So I'd I'd told Simon to sit that one out. And, yeah, we did those just a couple of dates with Max, and then Max was done. Bless him. So we ended up doing Brighton as a trio.

And, in '14 as well, you went to Tokyo for the third time with Pete. With Pete Astor. Yeah. And the monochrome set. That was quite odd, actually, because when we were little kids in the Sonic Tonics back in about 1980 or '81, We went to see the monochrome set.

We like the monochrome set. We went to see them at this venue in Oxford. And I can remember me and John Silver going into their dressing room and very sheepishly handing them a demo cassette of Sonic Tonics and shuffling away very quickly from the scary pop stars. And all those years later, I found myself in, I think it was yeah. It was.

It was in Shumo. It was in Shumo, Kitu Sawa, In a club there. Sound check time. Waiting around as you do. Sitting on a table in the club, playing my acoustic, having a jam with bid from the monochrome set.

The same guy that I'd nervously handed this cassette to about a hundred and four years ago. And there there we are, having a jam. Pals. So that, honestly, was a bigger thrill than you might imagine. Is that the third and last time you've been to Japan?

Is that, the Yeah. I think so. Yeah. It was kind of diminishing returns thing, Japan. The first time we went out, we went out, like, four piece band and loads of mates.

Second time, we went out, me and Max, missus Max, couple of mate. Oh, because Stuart Moxon was along as well from Young Marble Giants, and he brought a mate along who could speak Japanese. So we again, we're quite a big posse. And then by 02/2014, they've got it down to just fishy. You know?

But it was, you know, it was good fun being with Pete, and, it was good to get to know the monochrome set a bit as well. The various incarnations of the quartet are playing in places like Spain, and you have in fifteen seven dates in France. Yeah. And which seemed like quite an extended little tour? That that was kind of like we all knew.

Everyone in the quartet knew that that trip was either gonna make us or break us. It was all very improvised. Some of the gigs were, like, in villages. And, it was all very enjoyable, but even so, it wasn't quite certain. Even as even as we were doing it, it wasn't quite certain what the effect on the band was gonna be.

And then we got to Bordeaux. And, of course, in Bordeaux, it's a town with record shops and radio stations and people who know the words to jazz butcher songs and shit. And the response we got there just lifted things. We did this, there's a second Bordeaux gig. We we did the official one.

That was kinda good. But we had a spare day, and we was literally just asking the punters around the evening. You know? Like, yeah. Anywhere we could play on, say, Saturday or Sunday?

And someone said, yeah. Come play my flat on Sunday. And he was one of these guys. He does house concerts. It's quite a thing in France.

They do it a lot. The fellow who put me on in that theater in in the South Of Paris in September, he has got gigs in his living room as well. I mean, he at least he got us a proper venue. But he does have gigs in his living room. And we we did this living room gig in in Bordeaux, and it was insane.

It was it was so hot. I think I've seen a bit of film of it. There's footage of it. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. And so for all that tour was held together with, like, bits of plaster and funded with money we found down the back of the sofa. It was it was very good for us. And, yeah, we felt at that point as though nothing could hurt us. And indeed, by the 2015, we'd even, got ourselves some kind of an agent.

And, we did a run at the 2015. And, we got into two Steve had a way Steve had a routine in his life. He would take January off, and he would go to Thailand. He knew people in a village, and he would just go and live, like, with the natives in a village, way away from Bangkok and all that nonsense. Just go and sit quietly in a place where elephants would walk down the street.

You know? And he went away for that January 2016. He came back. And we just had a couple of meetings and starting to get it together again. And then on League Cup final day, he expired.

And it was never quite the same after that. There wasn't the center of gravity. I mean, we still did some good shows in that. We started getting more electric as well. Simon started getting to use well, he'd started getting into using effects on that French tour.

And, yeah, there were there were moments. But that explains why 2016 was a dead quiet year because Yeah. We didn't do very much at all. We did one show at the lamp with Pat on drums, and we did a show out at Bottey's Chateau. Yeah.

You played at party here. Yeah. That was insane. That was absolutely insane. I swear to God, Pat nearly was playing his drums.

We were all the hospitality was insane. By the time we actually got on, they kept delaying it because the the the party people were lingering over their dinner. So, oh, just another forty minutes, lads. More brandies. More spliff.

More beer. More wine. And even when we got on to start, we were, like, pretty shaky. And I can remember there's a moment in the second set where I looked around at Pat Keneally. And it was visible.

You could see it that he was following us. You know? He was watching us like a hawk, and you could see him go for the ride. Say, oh, no. Hi, Han.

You know, making his decisions as he went. And it's a tribute to how sharp that man is that it all sounded perfectly groovy. It didn't sound like the guitars and the bass were leaving the drums at all. It sounded like he was doing his job and driving it. But the truth is, I could tell he was, like, making it up as he went along.

So sharp. And, we've talked about the, you know, the dates as we as we go into '17 with the drummers off the subs bench, you might say. Joel and Dave Morgan, I noted. And you're supporting Jasmine Minx for a few dates and Yes. And David Jay.

And you you did a couple of dates in Scotland with Jasmine Minx. I think solo dates. Yes. We wanted to do it with the band, but, there were just too many problems. And it's just as well that we didn't either because, especially in Glasgow, lovely venue, lovely gig, like a church, Beautiful night.

But that didn't stop them trying to juke me over the money. Jim from the Jasmine's sorted that one out. But had we gone as a band, we would have dropped hundreds. So it's just as well. We did it the way we did.

Basically, I just I just attached myself to the Minx touring operation, and I was just kind of parasite. I said to I said to the audience in Aberdeen, I said, my name is Pat Fish, and my chief function here is to make myself a nuisance to the jasmine rings. And, when, just as a sort of side note, tell us a little bit about Drones Club. When were the were they formed about then? Or Drones Club's been around for quite a long time.

Actually, before I was involved, Steve New was in it. Right. They started I was there when Russ and Ian met, but I didn't get involved because, obviously, I thought I've got my own thing going on. And, Steve knew how to go at joining them on base, and they had a cellist as well. But nobody really knew what was going on, and it didn't really come to anything.

And so they all drifted away. And, Russ came to me and said, look. Would would would you give it a go playing bass? And I started going to these rehearsals, and I didn't have a clue what was going on either. And And I suppose somewhere around about the fourth or the fifth time we played, maybe maybe it was longer.

I don't know. But I can remember Ian brought this one tune in, and we couldn't understand. He's just playing it on bagpipes, and his foot's tapping, but it has no relevance that I can make out to what he's playing. And I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with this. You know, I'm getting borderline annoyed.

It's just like, mate, what? What are you trying to tell me here? Use your words like a big boy. And it eventually emerged that this tune that Ian was trying to play us basically went along the lines of very little Well, at this point, I looked at Russell, and Russell looked at me and we well, something must be done. So we kind of converted it.

We took the and we kinda took it into a sort of Tom White's Rain Dogs kind of much more swingy sort of thing. I found this kind of African type bass line. I was thinking of Tenerium. You know those guys? Oh, very good group.

They're like the sort of Sahara version of Spacemen three. And they really are hard Sahara men. They they ride around on camels with guns. That's their home life. They're not wanted anywhere.

They don't belong to any particular country. They're nomads. And everybody basically hates them. And they've just got this amazing desert blues band with electric guitars and everything. And, yeah, I was inspired by that.

And it was a kind of a moment because at that point, Russell and I were kind of dictating the rhythms to Ian, and he had just to play whatever he wanted to play. He was gonna have to play over that. And I think that was probably the dawn of the modern drones club, though it didn't really get good until Stevie Gordon joined us on guitar. That was Russ's idea, and it was an inspired idea. It just made the thing so much more solid.

I mean, you had Russ clattering away on his Durabooka. You had Ian honking and squalling on his bagpipes. And in between, you had me with a bass guitar, and it was almost as though I had to be the band. I had to supply all the music. So I was playing bass lines that were much busier than I really wanted to.

It wasn't that I couldn't play them. It was I just felt that I looked like a prick playing that much bass. And, of course, when the guitar comes in, I can ease right off, and we can support each other. And, also, I've got a brother in structure now. You know, both Russ and Ian would just kind of plow along their own sweet ways, and you never quite knew when things were gonna start, finish, or change.

And I was trying to impose that by, like, doing regular numbers of different bass parts, you know, and try and give it some shape. But it was only really when Steve was sitting there on guitars and understood as well that the songs really started to have some dynamic to them. You know? I really like it now. I'm really into it at the minute.

Raul was on the way out. Oh, he's just waiting for the doormen. Ah, yes. Time to go to work. You are good there.

Excuse me just for a minute. Yeah. Sorry about me. You meant, of course, to see doctor Goingback. I beg your pardon?

Doctor Going Back. Doctor Going Back. Yes. I but I especially like losses, lights, loves. That's that's quite a that's quite a good one.

I think that you're quite lucky to get losses, lights, loves. Yeah. I guess. Triple l. I was going to mention, twenty nineteen hundred club.

There was something it may have been to do with the fire records rereleases launch, one of the hundred club things, and and and and something on that something about the and the kids don't don't don't the kids just love it rather. This sort of seemed to be a super super group thing that happened in the hundred club again. That was interesting. This is eighteen, I think. Yeah.

Eighteen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You see, eighteen, Fire got on to AGMP, Adrian Gibson Music Productions, and organized a gig at the hundred club for us.

And, with our perennial drama problems, Steve knew that he'd solved them. He bumped into an old acquaintance who played piano, who turned out to be a big jazz butcher fan. Mhmm. This is Nick Vandy. Yes.

And with him came Lee Brooks, the drummer. A drummer of great intelligence, sensitivity, and above all, economy. We went we we did that gig at the hundred club in March with them, and that was the start of the quintet. And it was Bandy, of course, who delights in the opening sort of Mark Smith organ. Yes.

He loves doing his. That was extraordinary. That was an Arctic night. There were people from London phoning up saying they weren't coming because it was too hard to travel. It's like, yeah.

We're coming from Leicester. Right? But despite this, the hundred club was full. I think I was there. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Extraordinary turnout. We did that, and then we did another one at the hundred club shortly afterwards supporting a group called Bevis Frond, which is Nick Salomon and his psychedelic warlords. That gig was a logistical nightmare and not very enjoyable.

And I think oh, we did a we did a quintet show also for the Labour Party at the at the Labour Club, for which we were handsomely rewarded. That was with, John Higley. Oh, yes. I think I was there. I think you were.

Yeah. Yeah. You But I think He was funny. Yeah. He's good.

Always liked him. But I think, really, just that handful of dates. The next one that was coming up was Bristol. But at that moment, it just evaporated. I mean, having a five piece was hard.

Having a five piece with three of them living in one town and two in another was really hard. And I think that Steven Simon is sort of, like, just getting tired of it. And I'd have to admit it was getting to be a bit of a thing. But we've got this gig booked in Bristol. And, like, nobody fell out.

There's no screaming matches. There was no decisions or handshakes or anything. The group literally just evaporated. But I knew that people had bought tickets for the Bristol show, and I knew that some of them were coming from far away, like Wales, Germany, and things like that. Mhmm.

So I didn't wanna blow it out. And that's when the continuity JBC came in. Joel on the drums. Tim on the bass. Joe Wooley on the guitar.

Couple of practices here. One afternoon, we're in here. We're playing that song, Last of the Gentleman Adventures. Joe's really got the guitar part down. Sweet sound.

And there's a knock at the door. Boom. Boom. Boom. Excuse me.

I did chaps. Go and answer the door, and there's Liam who owns the place next door, which at the time, he was busy turning into a cafe. Lingos, show your music. Okay. Yeah.

Yes. It's really good. The first time in my life, the neighbors are banging on the door. Not to tell us. Moment.

Yeah. Exactly. Extraordinary. And, yeah, we took that down to Bristol. There's a DVD of it, actually.

It's it's quite funny because, it's not you know my thing. Work with what you've got. Work with who you've got. It's nothing like what we were doing just a few weeks before. It's much more you know, it's got more in common with, like, 1989.

And being aware that you can't always get hold of the likes of Tim and Joel because they're so busy. I figured, well, this could well be the last time I play a gig with a band. So I say to him at the end of the at the end of the gig, just before the last number, I say to the punters, look. This this could well be the last time you see me with a band. So, as they say in football, leave nothing upon the pitch.

I think I might have seen a a film of this on YouTube of Solar Core. It is on YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Going Ends up with Joe on his knees going.

Yeah. You're having a good go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

And and I suppose it I've got the whole gig now. In in '19, you're busy being ill for a bit, but it doesn't show too much because you're still doing the odd show solo. Well, the way the way the illness thing worked, just for the record, I was diagnosed in October, which looking back means that I probably had cancer for about two years at that point. I was whisked in the hospital and mucked around. My cancer treatment started in January, and it finished mid February.

I think it finished on Valentine's Day. I think it finished on February 14. And then on the February 21, I was around at Colin Henney's house doing that little, Internet broadcast thing with the covers. So it was pretty much get straight back on the bike. Yeah.

And you were you went you did one in Valencia as well? Yeah. I went before that, I went to Brighton. Did a show there with Helen McCookery book and the Aspos. Yeah.

And then, yes, again, Valencia was, booked. And, you know, you don't really wanna pass it up. I had I had some Bordeaux dates booked for just after Valencia. And we did Valencia, and it was great. But coming back was a struggle.

The journey home was a struggle. So I phoned up Bordeaux after that and said, look. I'm not coming. I'll I'll do you later. Because I was still feeling a bit under the weather right then.

I've got radiation bones up my ass. But, yeah, really, from from Valencia on, you know, it's it's it's a slow process of getting back on the bike. And by the autumn, you can see I'm out quite a lot. Yeah. And sort of will, in the meantime, sort of blew your cover a bit.

And Yeah. I mean, it's I I felt quite embarrassed and uncomfortable about all that because, you know, because Americans Yeah. You know, they they have to do fundraisers just to get treated. And I got all my treatment for nothing. So I was arguing with Willie all night.

I was saying, isn't this a slap in the face to those Americans? You know, you have to pay for their treatment. And he goes, ah, fuck it. And I was really very creepy about the whole thing. Until just in the conversation, we stumbled across the phrase, cash from cancer.

And we looked at each other, and we thought, yeah. Let's do it. At that point, I thought we were just gonna do the benefit gig. I didn't realize there was gonna be all this online money racing. But he said I mean, he rescued me from destitution with that.

You are such a clever pencil. That's a that was a proper sort of little little three port tap. Quite audible, wasn't it? Discreet. Yeah.

He was sitting on the doorstep showing no sign of coming in. I said, hey, mate. We've got we've got a train of thought going on here, and he just turned around and walked in. So clever. And yeah.

So I think, you know, if you needed rescuing, I think that was a well intentioned right thing to do. And and it was a it was a good, if if not slightly surreal night, wasn't it? I enjoyed it a lot. Not as much as, as old, Greeny did. Oh, no.

Mick had come pre enjoyed. I remember some you know, I mean, it there he was sitting there looking at a guitar like he'd never seen one before. You know? And, I forget who it was, but someone trying to sort of make the best of things said, oh, yeah. But he's a professional.

And I said, no. Cosworth is a professional. Because Cosworth could be wake up in the wrong town, terrible hangover, try to drink it off, get absolutely plastered, turn up with five minutes until he's due on stage, and still play guitar beautifully in tune and sing beautiful songs. Because Kursworth is a professional. Mick bless him that night was not a professional.

He had let circumstances get the better of him. And then as you said, do you manage to get out, you know, out, you know, going to Paris and other places? And I and you're sort of digging out some back catalog numbers that you haven't played for many years and sort of there's a Well, some of them I'd never played. Keeping the curtains closed, I'd never played that out live until then. And that Baltic song.

It was funny because I I might have said this to you before, but, when the love bus was released, a French journalist in a French magazine reviewed it. And went, ah, and one of the great moments of the SAP is boutique, where the guitar sounds almost like a harpsichord. Yes, love. That's because it is a harpsichord. This popped into my mind when Paris was on horizon.

I was thinking of songs. I thought, French people might like that. I might do that one. And to my astonishment, I found that it was actually it's quite easy to, come up with a solo version of it that sounds half alright. So I did it, and I got back home.

And then I saw some French person had reviewed it in some fanzine or other or something. And they put, as a highlight of the evening was when he plays. So, you know, I don't always get it wrong. Yeah. Maybe, if by that stage, we're having long conversations about your backpack catalogs, it's making you think of it.

I don't know. Excuse me one sec. Yeah. I'm gonna spend a penny as well. That's such a plain gift.

Come on here, man. Junomelt. Junomelt. Junomelt. Junomelt.

Tuna melt. Tuna, tuna. It's all about tuna. We got the tuna for a row. Chino, tuna.

It's all about tuna. We got a tuna for a row. Tuna melt. Tuna melt. Tuna melt.

Tuna melt. Tuna melt. Tuna melt. I've had a complete brain wipe. I've got no idea what we were talking about.

I was just coming around to bringing us up to date, and you were starting by that stage to play some newish numbers, including Never Give Up, starts up here, which brings us on to, the new new songs. So I thought, if possible, you might give me a little bit of a treat for half an hour and strung one or two. Just, in my day job, we would say, to act as a placeholder. Lorem Ipsum, that thing makes me so angry. Yeah.

To, I do not well, yeah. I did not. I mean, I do enjoy violence against language, but it's got to be creative and funny the way that the soul singers do it. What I cannot stand is just gratuitous ignorance, and lorem ipsum makes my blood boil. So I will try and do versions that are a little bit better than that.

So I've written down, I think, three or four that I'm aware of. But you, last time, I think you might have mentioned you you rattled off a dozen or so names that are in your mind or that you're brewing up. Yes. We need the instructions for this. So So I've written down Amalfi Coast, May 1963, and Melanie Hargreeves.

Okay. Well, those will both be available, do you Yeah. On YouTube. And the highest in the land, And never give up. Yep.

In fact, all of these all of these gems can be found from the YouTube. So you're going back out of that. Yes. So those four, I'm aware, are in particular because they're out there. Yeah.

But you might want to just I don't. Have them briefly. Do you want me to sing them, or do you want me to talk about them? Remind me of a night be toast. I must have heard it because you played it with quartet, but I I don't remember it, and I can't find it anywhere.

There is a recording of one of the Playhouse gigs, the entire concert. I think it's the second Playhouse gig. So it must have been Stevie Spinach on the gig with us, I think. And, that has it right at the front end. Yeah.

It's it's like an imaginary film soundtrack to a film set in Italy in 1963. Alice, are you familiar with very early soft machine? Sorry. Excuse my April. Or the first solo piece of Kevin Ayers, like Joy of the Toy or something like that.

Okay. It's that summery Mediterranean, slightly prog vibe. And I think there's a bit of Nino Rotor in my mind as well when it comes to the melodies that will sit on top of this. But it has absurd rhythmic complexity. It switches from bars of five to bars of six, almost apparently at random.

And when I took it to the quartet, I was a little bit nervous about how long it might take to teach the rhythm section how to do it. First time we played it, Stevie Gruffalo, all the way through. Not a hair out of place. Oh, Wait. Just washing the sound engineer's ears to see whether he's screwed or not.

Yes. You're sort of getting it, I think. +1, 23. That's still not good, is it? +1, 23.

+1, 23. +1 22. +1 23. I had it on completely the wrong setting on the capo, and it's only when I had to go up for the, d minor seventh. I realized quite how far up the dusty end I'd gone.

2, g. One, two, g. And that's that. Yes. That sounds, sounds like the sun's out.

Yeah. And, and, you know, maybe Audrey Hepburn is there in green sunglasses. Oh, open topped car on the road. You know that road that goes down the Amalfi Coast, like, above the village? Yeah.

Sun's out five in the morning. Open top white sports car. Audrey quite possibly in this passenger seat here. I wouldn't let her drive if she's had too much whiskey. Yeah.

And that will have, like, cheesy Italian plastic organs all over it playing the melody lines. Simon did a nice job, boo. It's a little bit too fluid, and I might try and get him to put some flugelhorn on there just to sort of, again, soundtrack it up, you know. But, the way I yeah. I'd I'd definitely see, like, Farfisa type organs playing melodies.

So that's that one. And Melanie Harvey's, I I've heard a few times. Yeah. What's the story behind that? It comes from Duran, my lodger.

He'd only been here a few days, and I forget who was here. There was someone who's visiting. And, when it became clear that Duran came from sort of Merseyside way, albeit the posh end, the fellow said, So when did you last see a burned out motor? You know, making conversation with the natives. You know?

And Duran quite earnestly answered, oh, well, that would be Melanie Hargreeves' father's jaguar. And, we were talking about this. Melanie Hargreeves, it turned out, was the first girl that Duran ever kissed. And her father had this jaguar, which little bollocks stole and took down to the beach and torched. And so the story told itself, really.

Initially, I was hearing TV personality's song, Salvador Dali's Garden Party. Salvador Dali's Garden Party, everybody was there. Julie Christie was there, and so on. And I heard Melanie Hargreaves' father's Jaguar. But I was working at the time with the quartet, and I was thinking, you know, it's about time I wrote something for these dudes that's in in their kind of style.

And that's I just fell on the, the sort of e minor b seventh sort of basic bluesy thing. You know, I went down to Saint James infirmary, that sort of thing. And, just the thing wrote itself. The chords fell out. Even the chorus chords just fell out.

And the thing, it was one of those songs like La Mer that wrote itself in about seven minutes. And I'm always keen to hang on to tunes like that because I always feel that when they write themselves quite that easily, there's probably something good about them. And the highest in the land Yeah. Seen it. I don't I I must have heard it out live.

But, Again, you can see a rather scabby video of me doing that in Brighton last year. Yeah. Or the I think that's what I have seen. Yeah. Yeah.

It's about othering. Othering? Other it's about the other and the way that we react to it or the way that people react to it because I don't identify myself. Yeah. Largely to do with animals.

There's a verse that he wrote, number one chief assistant, and it was hilarious because when I played in Glasgow, obviously not one person in that audience had ever heard this song before. And I'm tooling away through it, and there's an instrumental. And after the instrumental, I have, once or twice in rehearsal, been putting in this extra verse for Yaman here, for Raoul. And I'm literally thinking on my feet, except I'm not on my feet, I'm sitting down, but there's there's a story. Yeah.

I'm I'm thinking on my feet as it were, and I'm thinking shall I do the Raoul verse? And as I hit the end of the instrumental, I'm thinking, why the hell not? So I go, hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Now bear in mind, none of these punters have ever heard this song before. I clocked them on the very first line. There's two blokes down the front, and I sing the first line. Hey.

Hey. Boop a roop. Boop a roop. And I sing flocking pin. Hey.

Hey. Boop a roop. And they're singing along. A word that doesn't exist on a song they've never heard before, and the sec the first opportunity they get to sing it, they're singing it. I thought, that's nice.

So, yeah, it's about it's about the relationship of humans and animals and humans and other humans that they don't get on with, including the verse about Northampton Town. And it goes still still buzzing. I can't stand this being out of tune. It's odd, actually. This guitar is usually pretty good at staying in, but it's sounding like shit today.

Come on. Uh-huh. I got this fish from Genghis Khan. I got this fish from Genghis Khan. Gonna read my Bible.

I'm gonna study my Quran. Now I've been a monk since I was eight years old. Yeah. I've been a monk since I was eight years old. I don't want your money, baby.

I don't want your gold. Because I can see you and I don't need you and I'm not going to if I don't want to. Just because you had tell me to. Who the fuck can have I get anyway? Take a twat.

Take a twat. Now I live in a town wanna take a good life, I recommend that you don't go because I'm not going to if I don't want to. Just because you tell me to. You're going to have to understand. You're messing with the highest in the land.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Sing like a theremin, walk like a man. And all along Yeah. Not the best way I've ever played it. That's, that's reminded me for some reason of that, cover Gold you play sometime. Why would it?

I have no idea. It's not even in the Thames. It's not in the same key. It's not in the same time signature. Gold is largely major.

This is largely minor. Gold is folk based. This is blues based. The only thing I can think that they really have in common is one, I'm fingerpicking, and two, that the capo is on the second fret. Maybe it's just me.

I mean, gold is, Gold would be precious if it didn't require such hardy to see it to find it mines. Things remain precious just as long as they're red. So if gold could be found lying around everywhere, there it would be the lowest metal. It's too soft for serious use. So I can see it's totally unrelated.

Or maybe it's the feeling it leaves. I don't know. I don't know what it was, but I think it just came to mind. Yeah. I I want I wanted to, also sort of briefly cover Never Give Up.

Alright. Because, there's something there's a sparkle in the guitar, at a certain point in the chorus that I wanted to to just explore. Usually takes me a minute or two to get on a bike with this one. Depends how complicated I try to be. Because you don't know me.

That is c, b flat, a. That's what that is. It's just I mean, you you you've got your c shape up here, and it's yeah. Just Just a little figure on the top. Absolutely.

It's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, nice little shimmer on the analog delay that I use as well. But that's that's all it is.

It's in a way, it's really quite overwrought just to pull it out there, but it does and it sits nicely against the lyric. You know? You don't know me. It's almost like a call and response thing. Yeah.

Yeah. Do you wanna delve into what that's about? It seems quite personal. What shall we say? It's quite old.

It was only when I might have said this before. It was only when I hit on the little top and tail never give up routine Yes. You said that. That I considered rescuing the song. I thought that it was it sort of belongs of a piece with things like Mercy and, Shaky.

It comes from that sort of period around sort of 2010 sort of period. Yeah. I think I did first play it out in 02/2010. I remember playing it at the Constitution, but then I shelved it. I just did it the one so I think Max was there, actually.

I think he clocked it, But then I shelved it and then it came back a little bit when we were playing on that 2015 tour in France with the quartet. Because we were playing weird venues, we didn't really understand the concept of a rock show. We were doing all kinds of weird long sets. There was one particular night we did three forty five minute sets. And, on nights like that, it might suddenly appear.

And Simon was always a big defender of it. Simon Simon used to like the song and say, oh, should now actually do ballad that. But I still didn't really think anything of it until one day. I was just fooling around, and it was Never give up. Never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. I wasn't ready for you. And it just seemed to set everything in place. And then the real moment where I knew I was winning was when I went, never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. Never give up until you want to. And that still puts the sugar down me now. I actually practice the end of that.

I actually practice going until you want to and those notes have been selected and chosen. I've studied loads of different view. Little details that sound like they're just shrugged off your shoulder, you know. There's so much work can go into it. And that just that the phrasing until you want to and then I actually practice standing still and staring at them before leaving.

It's all it's it's perhaps unusually considered. I don't usually think about how things are to be presented live beyond practical musical terms. But that song demands that you leave a little space after it and just yeah? You know? And it talks the lyrics talk of, like, disintegration, you know, screaming on the stairs or the surroundings or something.

But Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I suppose that the the process is, you know, you you your first verse is just plainly romantic. You know? Oh, how could anyone ever be ready for you and all that?

In the second verse, we get a little bit sort of philosophical about it. It's like, oh, I agree with Dave, which is Dave Jay, of course, Embrace Your Dysfunction, which is on etiquette of violence. Hey. Hey. Good evening.

We were hearing earlier about Melanie Hargreaves. Oh, yeah? Yeah. She's Yeah. How much?

Great mystery. I've no idea. I've no idea. I've been quite tempted to look her up, but then it's I'll look her up. That'd be even creepier.

But, yeah, it's it's on the first couple of verses, it kind of steams through. And then towards the end of the second verse, it all starts to go a little bit sour. You know? Like, oh, what if it all goes wrong? And then you hit the the middle eight very, very fucking arch.

I'm surprised no one slapped me for doing this, but, you know, I'm married Isis on the first day of me. Straight out of the Bob Dylan song. But also the correct date. And I don't know what to tell you about Isis. I for for a couple of years, I didn't know if I should sing this song in case people thought I was singing about fucking Al Qaeda.

You know? But I kinda got over that. I thought, well, I should have been around for a whole lot longer than they have. So, yeah, there, it's it's like, you know, you can see him sort of smashing up his life in real time. And then that last that that that last verse, you know, it's like again, it starts off all romantic, and then it just flips over.

And it's like, yeah. This is what it's really like. You don't know me. So that's where the where the stings are. For me, anyway.

There's a film solicited to the Kettering Ford, Isis Legal. Alright. I was talking to to Lindsay the other day about PIMS and the damage that PIMS can do, and I was explaining that it's related to Eights Week in Oxford where they all have their little rowing boat races. And they hand out free PIMS down by the river, and you just see the finest minds of your generation, bathing and puking and fighting and crying and shagging in the woods. Why did why did Tims come up?

What did you just say? Isis legal. No. That's right. Yeah.

You see, the reach of the Tims that they have there in Oxford, they call it the Isis. And I was chatting with Linds, and I suddenly thought, well, I wonder if they still call it that. And then I thought, yeah. Of course, they fucking do. So I've themselves in that city that they probably hadn't noticed that there was a fucking operation going around with that title.

You know? So there's no those four we're aware of? Melanie Hargreaves, Amalfi Coast. Highest and Highest and Never Grew Up. That's right.

You've got those. Now I think beyond that, we're going to struggle, especially in terms of conversation because I think we're dealing with musical and lyrical fragments that I can't actually present you with the whole thing. Let's have a look here. Melfi, Melanie Hardridge, Never Give Up Highest, Goodnight, Sweetheart. Guess how that goes?

Goodnight, Sweetheart is an ending in search of a song. And I have got a song, Though I haven't got all the lyric for the song. I think we're here. In Temple of tea, Patrick. There's no one I'd rather be here with you.

Paul and Jim. I never saw. This is it's got a recital of the intro, so only a root note really, isn't it? I mean, it's all very friendly. It's like some dolphins or something.

One more. So you have a couple of verses like that, and then it's gonna go quiet. And it will go like. You know I said, how does it go? Oh, well.

And that will just barrel and barrel and barrel. And it freaks me out a little bit because I've kinda decided that will be the last thing that I record. So Not necessarily the last thing in the session. That would be taking things to extremes, which I've got a feeling the record's gonna close with that. And it'll be one of those, you know, diamorphine angels, sister death type jobs, art mystery job.

And, yeah, it's about thinking your girlfriend might be dead. Yes. When your phone's not working. But she's not. And it is.

And it is. And all you need to do is to swish it off and then I'll again. Apparently so. So, yeah, that's got some darkness. Damn this.

Fucking. Time is just a kind of fake can number. It really it it depends upon a beat, so I can't really do much with that. Couple of vaguely amusing things here. This one's based on the fact that all Dave j songs go c and f.

No. Actually, this one's going Oh, no. It's going. Oh, no. We could make it go c and f, but we won't.

We'll make it go b flat and, e flat instead. Wait a minute. Teddy had to come to a little accommodation. Things hadn't turned out in the way he'd hoped they'd hoped. Teddy got off three stops beyond his station, still believing he'd get paid if he was good.

Work in progress. Who's Teddy? Teddy's a cipher. It's about musicians. It's about what it's like being a musician.

You know? Still believing he'd get paid if he if he was good. It's one of the big mistakes you can make in this game. And then we oh, yeah. There's I'm an idiot.

That's a promising little thing. That's a sort of jaunty Pete Doherty sort of affair, really. What's the second chord, Pat? Because I'm an idiot. Hey.

Hey, baby. I'm an idiot. Don't go away because I'm an idiot. That kinda runs along like that. I haven't got all the words for that.

I've I've got them somewhere in a notebook, but I've lost them. Keep the whistling in if you can. Actually, it might it might be a song that could suit that. Yeah. Yeah.

That helps. Yeah. It might suit it. Oh, there's running on fumes. There's possibility of putting on versions of Quality People and the new version of Shame About You.

And there's You Can't Hurt Me, which is only a working title. It's a kind of soul number. Very Harold Melvin and the blue notes. Hey. Where are we?

And my favorite part of this is, when I go out in the evenings, I step out on my own. When I come home, just a word in your hand upon it. Feel so bad to be all alone. I can't stand it. And right now, I'm toying with the idea of going from.

Yeah. But I don't know if I can sing it. I'll do it. But that that actually exists as a as a whole song, as a piece of music, but I don't know what I'm doing with it lyrically, really. I've only got fragments.

Running on fumes reminds me of, my family forever accusing me of trying to kill them. And Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm actually sort of running out of fuel in running out of gas on the second time I ever drove in America. Alright.

And and I always say, you know, whenever I ever let you down, you know. Yeah. The answer is always never, but you've come close. Like that time that we traveled across the Mojave with a quarter of a tank of fuel. That one.

That time. Mhmm. Mhmm. And Yeah. That would do it for you.

We're running off fumes, running off fumes. Lord, everybody's running off fumes. There's nothing in the bank. There's nothing in the tank. Everybody's running off fumes.

Running off fumes. Running off fumes. Fumes. Richard Branson, Esther Branson, everybody's running off fumes. Make your own entertainment.

That's what you're gonna have to do. Make your own entertainment while you slowly come to understand your Yeah. Yeah. That's that's definitely the last line of that one. Definitely gotta stay in here.

Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, all these things, they're not in the right key. Things might change quite a lot. A lot of them have lyrics to be added.

Oh, the sea madness as well. And play the original version of this. C a. Yeah. Oh, that's put me off.

So he's wearing glasses. Let's try that again. Chorus goes my beautiful sea monster sea monster, elephant baby. And I tried to make that scene by making it, my beautiful sea mannings. My beautiful sea mannings.

And there's all kinds of things happening. Like, for example, you've got the minor there the first time around. Second time around, it's gonna be a major. Just it's it's an old trick going from minor to major on a chorus like that, swapping it over. It's a shame.

C cucumber doesn't scare. There is a professor in Japan who writes songs about C cucumbers. There really is. He loves sea cucumbers, and he loves them so much that when he's finished studying them for the day, he goes home and writes songs about how great they are. So, yeah.

I'd I'd I'd had a whole lyric for that, but I didn't like it. And so it won't be the one. But sea madness is still the working title. But I've got this bad feeling that at the end of the day, it's gonna go, my beautiful sea monster, elephant lady. You see what I mean?

I I think it's unavoidable because every time I run this beautiful sea monster elephant baby by someone, they just go, that's great. So I've got a bad feeling it's gonna somehow end up with that. But for the minute, we call it sea madness, And it's kind of a Kevin Ehrzy sort of thing. So there's all that. And then there's the one I come up just the other day.

I thought, why not, you know, respect the traditions of the blues and the traditions of rock. Why not, as a white man, start stealing melodies from old Trojan Rocksteady hits from the early sixties? And I thought this is a rich scene to be explored. And almost straight away, I'd had a chord sequence I didn't know what to do with. Almost straight away, it made some sense if I can remember it.

Come on. No. Maybe not. Maybe I'll just irritate you for a bit. Scratch a little.

That doesn't seem like a very good idea, does it? Unfortunately, I've got tape of this on a four track if I can't remember it. It. No. It's doubled.

So it starts 234. 12. Alright. I started off because it was it reminded me of the old rock steady tune I was thinking of. And at the minute, I'm searching around for something that scans like over the rainbow's end, and I've had a few thoughts, but I don't know which way it's going yet.

But it's such a pretty little thing, and it's so simple, and then it just drops into a Woah. Woah. No. It doesn't do that. And then so it just repeats on itself, and I think that's probably all it's gonna need, honestly.

Oh, god. And then there's yeah. I did a recording session for May the other night doing some guitar and bass on a couple of his songs, and I got home and I thought, you know what, Chris? Those chords are really good. I might nick them.

That's, I mean, all he was doing was, can't remember. Just one of those. You know? Just all the pop songs. But I have other takes on that.

I don't have to go For example, you know? No, I know how to go. And I've been toying around ever since Wednesday night with, trying to do that, but I think anything that I take away from that session in regards to those chords and shapes will probably end up as part of I'm an idiot. And at the end of the day, it'll be different time signature, different key, different chord sequence, But I know I've stolen it, and there you do too. Except, you know, it's it's like the Wilson sampling thing.

It's like you take a sample, but by the time you finish with it so much. Yeah. Exactly. By the time you finish with it, it sounds like something else. Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly that. And all songwriting. You know, there's only there's only sort of like 12 chords. Well, 24 chords, I suppose.

Well, it depends if you want diminished and the augmented. There's a lot of of chords. But at the end of the day, there's only 12 notes. You know? I was thinking since the last time we spoke, because as we finished about, oh, come all ye faithful for some reason.

Just in connection with the bells. And talking about, you know, why does God this, amazing thing that created the universe demand that we adore him. Yes. And I was thinking that, you know, we should at least abhor him. You know, abhor him would be a little too Well, I don't think that's very good.

Not very nice. Rejecting God, hating God. I mean, that's not really gonna get you anywhere, isn't it? Is it really? We can ignore him.

And I was thinking that there's this suggestion of the Chinese Japanese birds. Because you know how on how become fully faithfully, then the Yeah. That's when you need the bells in the church tower. You need to be and I imagine standing in the church tower, but I don't know how the notes go. But it needs tiny Japanese bells, standard little happy bells.

And then to paraphrase that scene of Jaws, we need some bigger bells. The shirts ringing Which song is this? Oh, come let us in. Yeah. But I know.

I'll come all I'll come all you faithful, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, I'm all you faithful, joyful and triumphant. But what's that gotta do with which of these songs has that got to do with? It's got nothing to do with anything.

It's just just what I wrote from last week. Alright. Sorry. I'm being sick. There's something I'm not getting here.

Yeah. It's there's no connection. I just wrote it down. And also no connection. It's this little I wrote I I did a little photo montage.

Alright. Having having having scanned all of those Right. I thought, what would happen if I took all of the bits of the photos that you're not paying any attention to because they're in the background? Sure. Or not to do with the people and put them in 16 blocks because the, so far we've done 16 sessions, which is quite neat because it runs it follows that four by four grid Mhmm.

Like the four by four grid of the pictures on the front of Sex and Travel and all that sort of thing. And just about any music you care to mention. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not recognizing everything.

No. You may. Oh, that's my wallpaper. Yeah. So It's just some kind of oh, that's Mitch making a video.

Mhmm. I don't there's one that looks like the front end of a drag race. I don't know what that is. Yeah. That's that's, Cole Cole and you drag racing.

There's a photo of me and Cole at the drag racing? Well, there's a photo of a drag car in there. Yeah. Yeah. Extraordinary.

That's me and Sonic at the NUJ benefit. Not quite sure what that is. Looks like a gig. The one with the sunflower at the bottom. What is that?

Penultimate. Oh, this one? There. Yeah. Oh, no.

That's a jukebox. No. That's a pinball machine. You playing pinball. Alright.

You know? Yeah. Anyway. It's little Drake arthropods. This is is this the Roxy?

That's the Roxy in LA. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh, Spencer. Yes. Is that the That's Spencer. Mhmm. Don't tease the gator man.

Lord. Yeah. We used to get you back to dance on the, on the stage, and then in in North Carolina, a voice came from the audience. Don't tease the gator, man. Lord.

Dear old Spencer. Yeah. It looks nice. And there we must have had. Yeah.

Giving me a bit of a treat at the end there. Sorry. I'm not really I haven't really got my I can play guitar.
