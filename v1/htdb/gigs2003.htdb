			Steve wore the wookie suit.

			Bot was Han Solo, re-interpreted as some manner of post-Cobain existentialist interplanetary
			hooligan outlaw.
			Mister E. Wilson and Headstone came out dresed in full-on monk outfits, Headstone allegedly "The
			Emperor".
			I'm quite surprised that emperors don't get to wear clothes with a bit better visibility.
			Perhaps they have underlings to be their eyes and ears. Misery stole the entire show,
			interplanetarily chic in her Star Trek uniform. Johhny P projected all manner of outer space
			stuff across the stage, the music was loud, the house rammed. People fell over. Bot fell over.
			Long after the rest of us had left the stage, he could still be heard - from no small distance -
			ranting at the bewildered punters.

			Top night out all round. Many thanks in particular to Johnny P for his amazing lights, and to
			Steve Ward for top PA.
			Our gratitude also to Skinner and to The Lodge for supplying essential bits and pieces at no

			We never escape. Every time we play Leeds on a Friday we are confronted with the Wankers' Parade,
			proof positive that a transport system reliant almost entirely upon private cars is already
			discredited, doomed, dull, dirty, dreary and shat. On occasions too many to number traffic on the
			M1 would slow to a crawl, grind along for twenty minutes and then dissolve into perfectly regular
			traffic once again, without there ever being any indication whatsoever as to the cause of the
			blockage. One driver per vehicle, of course, over and over again. Very important people. They'd
			tell you so themselves if they weren't already on the phone to somebody else almost as important as
			themselves.
			<p>
			From Northampton NN1 to Leeds LS6 (you can get tee-shirts with their postcode on too now, I
			noticed), a distance of some 180 miles, took us four and a half hours. No roadworks. No accidents.
			Just the Wankers' Parade. Rat-a-tat.
			<p>
			Still, Don't write a song about it.
			<p>
			Rich Morris and Disco Stu have gone for it this time. Two separate stages in the large-ish
			Brudenell Cheap Beer Club, five separate acts and an M.C. We've not been in Leeds long before
			things get underway with an earnest fellow with a laptop. It was a bit unfair of the compere to let
			on that the poor fellow was really playing Solitaire while a dodgy old drum n bass tape played in
			the background. To be honest, though, he really might as well have done that. How would anybody
			have known? Except it wasn't drum n bass - it was avant-bleepy Octopus Records 1997 sort of stuff.
			Two numbers and he was gone.
			Then the deeply culturally significant, dapper and generally swell D. Millard did his thing. He
			scared elements among the swelling crowd of punters and came across loud and clear, thank you very
			much indeed. Why is he not famous? We must make it so.
			<p>
			Thing is...when you're watching D. Millard screaming "Religion OOOOUUUUUTTTT!!!!" at people over a
			tinny eccentrically-tuned guitar, you're pretty much tempted to ask yourself, or a nearby punter.
			Well, how mental is that, then?
			As it turned out, tonight, it would register as well, only a bit mental.
			Â 
			But next, before there was time even to think of food, it was Wilson. Or "Mister Wilson", as we
			were so amusingly introduced by the M.C. We played the same set as at the Labour Club. I believe
			that the sound in the room was significantly better than what some of us were hearing at the time.
			It's not unusual. It didn't feel like we really caught fire (we could all hear ourselves, but you
			need to hear what everyone is doing before you can really get into something.) Still, no horrors,
			and good, solid versions of everything, well received. Our last tune, which seems to be called
			Buffalo Sniper or something now, on only its second outing, turned really evil. It was like Neil
			Young or something, but with horrid speed-garage blighters shouting "HIT HIM AGAIN!" over the top.
			One of those huge feedback pile-ups to close and we're done. An away draw, shall we say, although I
			might be being hard on the band there. Later, as I searched for the cigarette machine, two young
			teen girls stopped me and told me that we were their favourite band of the night. "G'night, Mister
			Wilson," they called. Curse that Diamond Jim!
			<p>
			Then things went a bit strange for a while. You know how some bands have exactly the right name?
			How they really couldn't be called anything else but that? Conjurer of Monikers stuff - inevitable,
			axiomatic and unchangeable. Hey, kids. Permit me to present: The Unpleasants.
			<p>
			I don't know if I'm equal to the task of describing this act. I understand that it's really a
			member of the highly-regarded northern indie combo Hood. having a bit of a laugh on his nights off.
			Straight away, might I just suggest to Hood's agent (in the slim hope that he might read these
			thoughts) that he should be getting the band a lot more work. The Devil makes work for idle hands,
			even for folks in indie bands. That almost rhymes, that does. (Stick with me...if you're beginning
			to feel a touch irritated at the tone, please bear with it. It's my effort to give a feeling of
			what it was like to be there.)
			<p>
			A man in a farmer's suit and flat cap sits at an electronic keyboard. He is wearing a ludicrous
			false beard. On the keyboard sits a monkey. Yes, a monkey. They talk to each other. It's like Keith
			Harris and Orville gone horribly, bickeringly, unpleasantly wrong.
			In between their little chats, the farmer and the monkey play this...music... that sounds like what
			might happen if Richard Formby accidentally blew up a science laboratory and went hopelessly,
			irredeemably mad. Kids, this is not Tom Waits noodling around coz the piano's been drinking, not
			him. No, Virginia, this is hideously well-organised, cheesy northern English...music and it's
			wrong, boys and girls, it's deeply, deeply wrong. And there's a monkey.
			<p>
			In my innocence, I imagined that the farmer was taking advantage of his beard disguise to do the
			talking on the monkey's behalf as well. Admittedly, he seemed to have the exchanges down to a fine
			art, but - hey! - if you're going to be good at something, eh, son? But no, it was so much worse
			than that. There was another man - concealed about the back end of the club with a microphone -
			doing the monkey's bit. This intelligence caused my brain to explode. Oh God, people, if you could
			just hear their ghastly music. People say it was the monkey. The monkey was cack, sure. But, oh,
			God help me, it was the music. The horrible, horrible, English music. Make it stop, oh, please,
			please make it stop...
			<p>
			We had heard that Sammy USA were highly-regarded round these parts, and liable to sign some kinda
			deal in the next three quarters of an hour or so. In geological time, anyway. Five-piece
			traditional indie band. Madonna on keyboards (dressed down for the occasion), Monkey (Great King,
			Equal of Heaven) on lead guitar, Rufus and Doofus on drums and bass (indie sprawl, plod, splatter,
			plop) and some fey southern youth singing and playing guitar. "You can't act like you created the
			stars, it's not right" was their lyric (their enormous entourage will probably now have me arrested
			for daring to print their lyrics without permission. Swivel.) sung to a very pretty melody. It
			helped that Madonna consented to adding a bit of backing vocal at this point. (I've heard she's all
			right on the consent thing.) And, errrrm...that was it. It churned on and on, self-regarding and
			self-pitying. Pack of bedwetters. I'm sure they'll do well. Rat-a-tat.
			<p>
			But, hang on - the name thing : I mean, for Christ's sake - "Sammy USA" - surely, if anything means
			anything at all in this meretricious, facile shop-window of a world, then might we not count on a
			name like that to offer the prospect of some good old electricity, excitement, danger? Irony even,
			if you must. For a UK band even to have the letters "USA" in their name at this moment in "history"
			(Hey, gang? Remember when History wuz Dead? Me too! Francis Fukuyama - crazy name, crazy guy!)
			should surely be some kind of signifier? Or (may I quote En Vogue here?) WHY EVEN BOTHER? Call
			yourselves the Richard and the Judies or something, if all you're going to write about is your
			piss-poor, rather short life in a suburb in Hertfordshire. Most importantly, just Get the Fuck
			Outta My Face, You Can't Afford It. Me Courtney, you Hollyoaks. Whenever you're ready, lads...
			<p>
			(PS - Madonna - dump these puddingy losers now. We all know you've still got it in you, love.)
			<p>
			Errrm, yes. Well there it is. Good band, bit like Blur. Excuse me a minute...
			<p>
			Back to Richard's, where we were royally paid and fed pizzas that tasted of carrots. It's just
			plain weird up north.

			Well, the Nazis got smashed once again, and later (in our own little way) so did we.
			<p>
			Eaglehead went on first and played a blinder. Unfortunately, nobody gave them any idea as to when to stop.
			They eventually finished with a ferocious cover of "These Boots Are Made for Walking", while Pig Unit and
			Wilson shuffled around nervously, wondering how the hell they were supposed to squeeze their sets into the
			sixty minutes that remained before closing time.
			<p>
			Credit to the Pig Unit boys, who showed immense courtesy in cutting short their set, especially in the
			light of the fact that several dozen people were going entirely mental apeshit at their every move. It's a
			heavy rap-rock sound that they make, but they are probably rather more enticing than that makes them
			sound. Just one quibble - couldn't they change their name to Pigs Unite? Or even Pigs United? (Pig City? -
			sounds like an Iggy bootleg...) (Pigs Villa - now you're just being silly...)
			<p>
			Wilson made it to the stage at about 10:45pm. A number of the players were quite wound up, something that
			was immediately apparent as we kicked off with a newly beefed-up Police Chief. Possibly because there had
			been a drum kit there before, the stage seemed unusually spacious. I remembered all the shite European
			rock bands that I had seen on TV shows over there, who always seemed to have a moment when the long-haired
			guitar nutter suddenly runs out to the front, stuffs his foot on a monitor and gurns madly as the only
			audible bit of guitar on the whole record suddenly blurts out from the whirring of massed eighties
			synthesisers. And that's what I did. Later on, for reasons to do with getting over-excited, I did the
			James Brown thing and fell down flat on my back mid-solo. Misery and Russ later expressed some concern
			about my physical wellbeing. When I revealed that I'd meant to do that, their concern switched to my
			mental condition. Stevie G was a rock god (great equal of heaven, why do you not grow sideburns?) and
			there was enthusiastic shouting all round.
			<p>
			Unable to do anything about the fact that the bar was on the brink of closing, we ploughed on, and
			incredibly the audience stayed with us. Complete strangers were dancing down the front. Somebody called us
			"Mental Mondays" and bought some records. Things were looking up.
			<p>
			Altogether, we had gone into this night quite confident. Then we ran into all kinds of unexpected
			technical difficulties at soundcheck and found ourselves pushed back into some desperate post-drinking
			graveyard shift, to the point where that confidence was almost entirely dissipated, but STILL we managed
			to come up smelling of the finest Morroccan. Mental
			middle-aged sociopath crew makes desperate last stand, achieves last minute home win. The crowd goes mad.
			Well, Lindsey does anyway.
			<p>
			We bludgeon the Buffalo Sniper to death, and as the last howls of feedback fade away a piano rings out
			through the P.A.
			It's Mister Noel Coward, and he's singing: "Don't let's be beastly to the Germans..."

			We recently enjoyed a visit from the ${linkExternal(http://www.kerosenebomb.com, Great Cole Coonce)}.
			We laid on a
			rehearsal while he was here so that he could get a flavour of the Wilson
			thing, and it actually turned into something of a private gig. Much
			fun. Cole duly set off for a cycling tour around Tuscany (oh, he's fit
			for his years) and we set about preparing for our return to the Soundhaus,
			report below:
			<p>
			We hadn't played the Soundhaus since our very first show, so it was
			pleasing to get the invitation to come and play there again.
			<p>
			The evening took an early turn for the weird while we were still
			soundchecking, when we lost Mr. E. Wilson after some chronic
			misunderstanding with the local promoter in re. beer. He had managed
			to get hold of the wrong end of a number of sticks, but it had all made
			him so angry that he just packed up and legged it. The soundcheck passed
			without further drama and we repaired, along with sonic technician Stevie
			Ward, to Shakespeare Villas to watch England's game against Slovakia.
			<p>
			At half-time England were trailing by a goal to nil, but we had to set
			off and do our thing. After a pleasant stroll round to the venue we went
			in to find the first band, Ambience, already on stage. The audience? Oh,
			we were the audience. By the time we took to the stage (announced by MC
			Bot as "the Wilson Five") a few brave souls had abandoned their tellies
			and showed up to watch. What they got for their trouble was a 30 minute
			blast of guitar-heaviness, with Stevie G. on record-breaking form.MC
			Bot was probably fortunate that the place wasn't too busy: otherwise
			his persistent shouts of "GAY BAR!!!" might have been misunderstood. But
			hey - we were always going to like the Electric Six. They are our kind
			of people having fun.
			<p>
			The audience was small but appreciative and the set rushed by, hitting
			the wall at the end of Buffalo Sniper with a mighty slap, while maniacal
			laughter rang out through the feedback. No time for mutual fan-club
			action, though, for we had to clear our shit away to make room for the
			headliners, an agreeable quartet from Nottingham called Fin. Their style
			is a bit all-over-the-place, but they play very well and Jamie, their
			singer, definitely has the looks and the charisma for the job. We got
			on well with them, for they had seen our set and declared it "f***ing
			brilliant".
			<p>
			Afterwards we walked our kit round to Misery's place, just a hundred
			yards (eighty metres, Euroreaders) from the venue, before heading back to
			Shakespeare Villas to party with Johnny P and Will Carruthers, who were
			over from Rugby Town, and to listen to the new album from British Sea
			Power (it's the last track you want - all 15 minutes of the fecker!). Will
			was on top form, winding up everybody in sight. It being midweek, we
			shut down at around half past two after a very pleasant evening.
			<p>
			Oh, and England came good in the second half, with two goals from Michael
			Owen bringing in the essential three points.

			The mysterious business of the disappearing Wilsons came back to haunt us on this one.
			<p>
			Stevie G returned from working in Leicester last week to find that his clueless flatmates had gone and spent
			about three hundred pounds of Steve's own money on a nice holiday for him. They had cheerfully ignored his
			suggestions that a trip to Turkey starting on Monday might be just the ticket. Instead, they booked him onto a
			holiday trip that departed on Saturday morning. Steve only discovered this on Friday evening, and to be fair, he
			came straight and told the other members of the band that he was suddenly and unexpectedly out of the starting
			line-up for Sunday's gig. Naturally, we abused him luxuriously and left him to his fate. For the clueless
			flatmates had not booked Steve a nice trip to Turkey. Oh no. Our poor guitarist found himself gazing straight
			down the barrel of a full ten days in a compulsory-sex-and-throwing-up gulag in Ibiza! Somebody pointed out that
			it makes Guantanamo Bay seem like quite an attractive distination.
			<p>
			Faintly rattled, the remaining quintet pulled together a rehearsal on Saturday night, a lengthy but relaxed
			affair, enlivened by calls of "Sack the bald bloke!" from a passing Sonic Boom. The few pals in attendance
			declared that we appeared perfectly match-fit as a quintet, and we felt all right.
			<p>
			Now, about Magic Skool Bus...
			It has crossed our minds that maybe they were winding us up. If so, they deserve some kind of award.
			UK readers will be only too aware that pubs close at half past ten of a Sunday. We had organised a three band
			bill, which really was all that there was time for. Over the weekend, the drummer of Magic Skool Bus, one Rory by
			name, advised us first that there was to be a fourth band on the bill, then - at the soundcheck - that a FIFTH
			ensemble was on its way to join in the fun!
			Frankly, I couldn't see how on earth Rory was going to get four bands on and off the stage in time for us to get
			on at ten o'clock.
			<p>
			We decided that it was probably for the best if we just let Rory and his pals get on with doing whatever they
			were going to do, so after a quick and easy soundcheck we quit the theatre of operations and kept out of the way.
			<p>
			At about eight thirty I stuck my head around the door of the venue. Small herds of teens milled across the dance
			floor while Victims of the Establishment did their punk rock thing. Damn fine it was too. V.O.T.E. seem to have
			taken on that Wilson thing of having three big blokes yelling at you all at the same time, and it worked well.
			They looked good, they sounded good and by golly it did me good. After a couple of tunes I headed back to the
			front bar to join the growing pack of friends and mentallists assembling to see my band. Johnny Octopus and his
			girlfriend had come up from London, and we were also graced with a visit from a gentleman who worked on the
			British Mars probe that just blasted off the other day. I don't think I've ever met a man who had launched a
			space ship before. (Or does Kizzy O'Callaghan count?)
			<p>
			A few beers later, I popped my head around the door again, and was delighted to find Magic Skool Bus taking the
			stage. This band is very mad. They play ska-punk music, with a three piece horn section. They play very fast
			indeed. The teens were digging it like good 'uns. I was just happy that MSB had made it onstage in time.Â 
			<p>
			When it came time for The Bus to leave the stage I grabbed Rory: "Congratulations, mate. I don't know how you did
			it, but we're bang on time." He replied: "Well, the fact that two of the bands didn't show up might have
			helped..."
			<p>
			So there we have it. Three bands, just like it said on the posters. So what was it? Were there really two mystery
			bands who just failed to show up? Or was it all just the Wind-Up Of The Week? We here at Planet Wilson STILL
			don't know!
			<p>
			Around about ten o'clock, then, we got up. And from the very beginning we knew we were going to be having a bit
			of a night. The crowd had swelled by now, with many of the usual suspects in the area and bent on mayhem. This
			being the case, we thought that maybe we should deliver them of exactly that - mayhem. And that, dear readers, is
			what they got. With Steve safely locked away in the fleshpots of San Antonio, I turned up the amplifier and went
			for it.
			<p>
			Curtis was on fine form too. In addition to his Air-FX machine, he is now also the proud owner of an Air-Synth.
			Not that you would know: he has taken to concealing all his technology in a small box draped in black fabrics.
			There was some talk about maybe printing something on the box. My favourite suggestion was: "CASSETTE PLAYER".
			The sound was good and strong, with Misery laying down rock-hard bass. As the set went on, Skinner began to drop
			delays and effects into the mix. We gave it some forty minutes, detonated the last chord of Dark Agenda with some
			first-class sonic Semtex, and split, leaving the happy punters bellowing for more through the feedback. I can't
			say for certain, of course, but it felt as if we had just hit a new level altogether. As Mr. Cotton put it, "A
			stunning performance , I realise that you felt you were on the brink of relegation , but I think you went on to
			Win The Cup."
			<p>
			Mr. Cotton is also responsible for the accompanying screen dump. God bless him!
			<p>
			Records and shirts were sold. Money changed hands. MC Bot (who had a blinder himself, by the way) appeared with a
			case of Becks Bier. We jumped into Steve Ward's jet-black A-Team stealth van and vanished into the NN1 night.
			<p>
			When I went into Deepak's shop this morning, he said "I hear you had a good gig last night." Bloody hell, if
			people are volunteering glowing reviews of our shows to their local shopkeepers, we must be doing something
			right.
			<p>
			Oh, and I heard it was raining in Ibiza...saucer of milk for Number 77 please...

			Wales for a gig at one of Fred's legendary parties. It was a memorable 
			evening, but the members of the posse who don't eat meat did have one 
			small problem, what with curried goat being the dish of the day. Your 
			correspondent had a whale of a time on a diet of Liquorice Allsorts, as 
			it goes.
			<p>
			So it was that this August the corner shops of NN1 were systematically 
			stripped of Mrs. McCartney's sausages and Soylent-Green-Burgers by 
			shadowy, black-clad marginals. Instant barbecue kits were purchased from 
			supermarkets - along with jars of olives, jars of sun-dried peppers, 
			multiple dips, hummus, pitta bread, buns, chocolate. Somebody has packed 
			a vegetable grater. By the time that Saturday comes, one thing is clear: 
			the veggie faction is not going to be caught out this year, no sir.
			<p>
			Something else is to be different this year; the hotel where we stayed 
			last time has closed down while a new owner tries to make sense of it. 
			This time it's to be camping.
			<p>

			Early on a sunny Saturday afternoon the convoy sets off from the 
			Racehorse. Kathie and I find ourselves travelling with the estimable Mr. 
			Cotton and Sarah. We stop to loot Oddbins of its Budvar and Urquell, 
			then, intending to avoid bank holiday motorway hell, we take to the back 
			roads: Builth the pretty way. Huge farm carts piled with hay rumble 
			along in front of us at ten miles an hour. We play The Bad Seeds and the 
			Electric Six as we negotiate strange, obscure country villages, some of 
			which appear to have been occupied by stealth by the Freedom - sorry, 
			The French. In Leominster deeply tranquillised pedestrians wander 
			heedlessly beneath our wheels.
			<p>

			We reach Builth in the lovely early evening sun. As we drive up the high 
			street we see Stevie Ward's A-Team bus parked up, MC Bot hanging out 
			of the passenger seat window with his bullhorn, yelling "Wilson in the 
			area!" just like he did 11 months ago. Builth Wells' picturesque 
			little high street is heaving with people from Northampton.
			<p>

			After a few fraught minutes in the Hinterland, we once again find the 
			lane that leads to the party's secret secure location. We arrive to find 
			that a small camp has already sprung up in a far corner of the field and 
			here we join Russ and Nita, Misery, Mister E. Wilson, Stevie G, Stevie 
			Ward and his band. Tents go up, a fire pit is cleared for the barbie, 
			the Budvar crate takes a hammering. MC Bot bestrides the hillside with 
			his bullhorn.
			<p>

			Witness the birth of NN109.
			<p>

			Across the field, resplendent under their gazebo in the evening light, 
			sit the citizens of The High Chaparral, Jamie Jab and his crew of 
			mentallists. Relations between the twin settlements will be warm and 
			increasingly incoherent as the evening wears on.
			<p>

			The entertainment is nothing like what we had been led to expect. No 
			Welsh bands are taking part this year, and a PA has only just been 
			secured. That leaves only us and the debut performance from Stevie 
			Ward's new band, Good Cop Bad Cop. There are many members of P-Hex in 
			the area (well, in the field, I should say), but they are light of a 
			drummer. Stevie G makes a brave attempt to persuade Mr. Cotton to play 
			the drums, but Mr. Cotton is confused, thinking that Steve is referring 
			to Wilson's set. "Have you cleared this mad idea with Pat?" he asks. 
			"I don't have to," replies Steve bafflingly.
			<p>

			There is also the inconvenient fact that Mr. Cotton is actually a 
			guitarist, not a drummer at all.
			<p>

			So in the end we explain to the frightened-looking young lads with the 
			PA that they only have two bands to worry about. Kit is set up and sound 
			is checked. The courtyard is crowded with happy people eating barbecued 
			goat. We leg it back to NN109 for the first hot food of the evening.
			<p>

			As night sets in there are amazing views of the stars. You can see the 
			Milky Way clearly. "I can see why the Egyptians saw it as a mirror image 
			of the Nile," I venture, and promptly fall into a hole. If you're 
			lucky with the clouds, you can see Mars, as close as it has been to our 
			Earth since the days when Neanderthals roamed the hillsides, making 
			their camps, lighting their fires, cooking their food and singing their 
			songs.
			<p>

			ASTERRRRROOOOOID! COMING IN FROM THE VOID!
			<p>
			As the awesome sounds of the new Killing Joke album split the air, the 
			entire sky clouds over. What can it mean? My utility belt tells me "To 
			the barn, Batman."
			<p>
			Good Cop Bad Cop are heavy. A mean metal three-piece. There are great 
			tunes in there, but the PA boys have got things so cranked that it's 
			not always easy to tell from inside the barn: the band actually sound 
			better from about 40 yards away. Still, it's a fine first gig for 
			them. Their drummer is quite something, a definite touch of the Grohls 
			in there.
			<p>

			MC Bot takes to the decks, banging out Primal Scream, The Streets, 
			Wepunex, The Prodigy and Killing Joke. We wire ourselves up, ready to 
			go. Then it's time. It takes a moment to get the DAT up and running, 
			but soon the barn is echoing to the sound of Tim Leary and his 
			psychedelic sheep.
			<p>

			We start with a new, toughened-up version of God's Green Earth before 
			diving headlong into the Hippy Shit. The monitors are fairly screaming 
			at us onstage, but out front it's a clear, bass-heavy sound, with 
			Misery taking full advantage of Good Cop Bad Cop's excellent bass rig 
			(thanks, Alex!). She plays a blinder and the band feels great, we're 
			flying. The set:
			<p>
			GOD'S GREEN EARTH - HIPPY SHIT - SWEET HOME ALABAMA - BURN HOLLYWOOD 
			BURN - ISTANBUL CONNECTION - CRITTERS - SECRET GOVERNMENT - EVERY 
			SATURDAY NIGHT - POLICE CHIEF - QUALITY PEOPLE - YELLOW PAGES - BUFFALO 
			SNIPER - DARK AGENDA.
			<p>
			As we start into Yellow Pages I realise that my microphone has gone 
			totally dead. In a mad panic, I seize Bot's mic and shout my way back 
			on board. It ain't pretty, but it works. Confusing, though - why 
			should it just go down like that? Bizarrely, at the end of the song I 
			get my mic back. Life goes on, but then, just as Buffalo Sniper should 
			be gathering force and steaming out of the breakdown, something really 
			spectacular happens. For the first time ever at a gig we find ourselves 
			without any kind of backing track. We're just running on our own 
			momentum. Fascinating - no time to think about it: we adopt a kind of 
			chug, hold our nerve and eventually rejoin the backing track as it 
			mysteriously resurfaces towards the end of the tune. Dark Agenda goes 
			off all right, featuring a chant of "No techno! No techno!" and an even 
			more out-of-control finish than usual. I leave my Telecaster feeding 
			back in a pile of rubble at the side of the stage and run out of the 
			barn. I stand in the courtyard for a minute or two, listening to the 
			sheets of filthy noise issuing forth. Then I run back in though another 
			door, to find MC Bot crouched over my effects, making mayhem. We escape 
			with our lives.
			<p>
			Even as we start to pack up, the techno begins. Out in the little yard 
			in front of the barn some eight or ten youths have gathered. They play 
			the deepest, darkest, dumbest techno at the loudest volume and set about 
			getting silently, wholly monged. We make a surprisingly efficient job of 
			stowing our kit and flee the area.
			<p>
			Back at NN109 I'm talking about the weird way that the top quality, 
			super-loud PA just suddenly went completely random on us towards the end 
			of the set. That's when somebody explains about the techno lads. 
			Towards the end of the set they came into the back of the barn (like 
			I'd notice. I'm a fecking guitar scientist, me. I'm lucky if I 
			notice anything back there) and started taking the record decks and 
			their attendant electronic shit out into the little yard. In so doing, 
			apparently, they managed to unplug loads of wires that had nothing to do 
			with the disco set-up, but everything to do with our disappearing drum 
			loops.
			<p>

			I have to say that my first reaction to this intelligence is to want to 
			go and batter the wotless youths within an inch of terminal oblivion. 
			Happily, better living through advanced biochemistry is achieved and I 
			come to take the broader view. Clarity, Simon, that's the main thing. 
			With understanding comes forbearance. With half-litre bottles of Budvar 
			come custom cigarettes and sausages in buns.
			<p>

			For hours people gather around the barbie, drink, smoke, speculate, 
			celebrate the footie results. The techno never lets up. Boom! Boom! 
			Boom! There is ill-advised cooking. Stevie D appears to freeze like a 
			statue, completely motionless out there in the night. Then, as Stevie G 
			goes to investigate, he drops like a felled tree. Into the car he goes. 
			'Night, Steve.
			<p>
			Daylight comes. Profoundly unevenly cooked Linda sausages litter the 
			area. Everybody has lost everything. Ian from P-Hex goes to sleep on the 
			ground. Jamie is heading back to the High Chaparral (though I can never 
			remember this name - I keep on wanting to say "Camp X-Ray" but I know 
			that's not right, so I just sort of get lockjaw), but before he goes 
			he seals me into the back of Russell's motor, where I plan to sleep. 
			As the hatchback closes on me I give him the thumbs-up through the 
			glass. I feel like a spaceman being sealed in his little capsule.
			<p>

			I awake to the sound of somebody (Curtis, as it turns out) playing 
			electric guitar. It's quite beautiful, but it's coming from far away 
			and I'm still three-quarters asleep and it's a little bit hard to 
			make out. There are weird little high frequency squeaks going on, which 
			I assume must be the amplified sound of fingers on strings. Once I 
			extract myself from the back of the car in an ungainly fashion, it 
			becomes clear that these high frequency squeaks are, in fact, coming 
			from a small and excited dog, whom Misery and Sarah are tormenting with 
			a luminous green frisbee.
			<p>

			The morning is overcast but incredibly hot. Bodies are strewn across the 
			field. There is suffering. Somehow, heroically, Mr. Cotton takes the 
			wheel of his car and prepares to take us home. Russ urges him to visit 
			the cheese shop in Monkland.
			<p>

			"Yeah, just gimme the fuckin' cheese!" cries Stevie G with feeling.
			<p>
			That's right. Monkland. Also, not far from here, they have a place 
			called Paincastle.
			<p>
			A road closure because of an accident on the A-44 leads to our being 
			compelled to drive home over the very roof of the world. I fall asleep 
			in the back of the car, and awake to find that we are pulling into a gas 
			station. In Telford. It has to be said, it is a class gas station, with 
			a proper shop and a nice Days Inn attached, so that you could - in 
			theory - check in for a few days and get a proper feel for the place. 
			A kind man in London subsequently sent me the attached illustration, 
			showing clearly the delights of checking in at the Telford Days Inn.
			<p>

			We arrived in NN1 at teatime, battered. Once again, a superlative party 
			out in Builth. Some of them were out there for days. Thanks to Fred and 
			everyone for making it such a good trip.

			Guy Fletcher's birthday party has gone in some way oddly public,
			exposing the heroic Wilson squad to the rigorous aesthetic demands
			of the regulars at the Plume Of Feathers in Weedon, Northants this
			coming Friday night, 3rd October. Factor in a visiting band of Hull
			City Ultras and a few random Brazilians and it begins to look like
			it's worth the few miles drive out of Northampton and into the
			town that really does have its own Crossroads Motel.
		)},
		pat=${literalizeCommas(
			A few days before this gig in a village pub Agent Wilson asks me how long a set we are supposed to play."Oh, 45
			minutes, an hour..." I reply. He looks at me: "How long do you think we'll last?"
			<p>
			He's got a point. We aren't really the kind of thing that you see in village pubs a great deal. Yes, we do the
			odd cover version, but no, it's not Status Quo or Travis. We're also kind of loud. Despite the fact that we've
			been invited there to play for Guy Fletcher's
			long-awaited birthday knees-up, there is a detectable whiff of "Is that all you do?" on the breeze with this one.
			<p>
			For the first time in ages we arrive at the gig in the dark. E-Man having thoroughly explored the entire region,
			I finally persuade him to drive us into Weedon village itself, where we soon spy a small traffic congestion
			scenario as the other memers of the band load their kit into an attractive, flower-bedecked country pub. Not the
			sort of place we usually play. At all. I slip in through the door to discover that the pub is (a) really rather
			tiny, and (b) extremely loud. This is down to a pack of young village lads, average age about 19 (don't it make
			you sick, American readers?), who are already blind, screaming drunk at 6:30pm. As I struggle my amp into
			position on a skittles table I console myself with the thought that, by the time we go on, all these boys will be
			lying quietly in a coma somewhere.
			<p>
			With a great deal of help from Mister Fletcher we get ourselves installed and wired up in a tiny space at the end
			of the bar.
			<p>
			With the lads still howling all around us, we launch into a version of Hippy Shit for a sound check.
			We arrive at a reasonale balance and stop. There is a misguided smattering of applause. Then we watch,
			astonished, as all the drunk boys file quietly past us and out of the pub. One or two are shaking slightly. One
			or two say things like "Really good, lads. See you later." Stevie G fixes me with a satisfied beam and declares
			"Wel, THEY won't be back..."
			<p>
			It's round about now that the Hull City Ultras appear, 15 quid the lighter from their scenic taxi ride with a
			driver who took the time out to tell them "That Jazz Butcher - good little band." There, readers, but for the
			grace of God and a pathological inability to work a steering wheel, goes your correspondent. I don't spot any
			Brazilians, though. With everything in order, we sink a beer and stroll over to Mister Fletcher's house across
			the street, where hot food awaits.
			<p>
			MC Bot and I go careering into Mister Fletcher's rather lovely little cottage, bellowing in laughable Welsh
			accents about the decor. Stevie G's pal Maxine remains convinced that we are both Welsh. Next we are going to
			tell people that E-Man is Norwegian, Misery is Scottish and Agent Wilson was born in a boxcar on the Santa Fe
			railroad. Stevie G himself, of course, really is from Argentina. Mister Fletcher, being a pro musician himself,
			has thoughtfully laid on a top spread, which is gratefully mauled by the assembled. Then there is frantic rolling
			and smoking prior to our return to the pub and the Moment of Truth.
			<p>
			The bar is heaving. It's Friday night anyway, Guy's pals have all come out for his party, and then there is a
			surprisingly large numer of folks out from NN1 to see the group. All very gratifying, but it's more than Bot and
			I can handle, so we head back out into the car park. Around the back of the pub is a lovely wee garden. I am
			transfixed by an enormous and very beautiful willow tree billowing out over the lawn. I'm thinking how good it
			would look in the bright October sun. Bot says it looks like a Wookie. We pile onto the little kiddies' assault
			course erection, cross a precarious rope bridge and arrive at the top of a wooden tower, where we enjoy a panic
			attack.
			<p>
			Duly refreshed by our brush with nature's grandeur we take up our instruments and start Hippy Shit for real.
			Within seconds Bot's mic stand is on the floor in bits. It's a bit of an avant-garde design, honestly, and it
			stands no chance with the plucky MC. The room is full of people sitting at tables, all facing us as if asking "So
			why do you want this job, Mister Wilson?" The situation is weird, but the sound is surprisingly together. It's a
			bit like skateboarding (with my centre of gravity!), but we arrive gracefully enough at the end of this rather
			hostile opener to what sounds like applause. Onward!
			<p>
			It all went pretty sweetly. There were times when I was finding it hard to hear the backing track. For a while I
			tried seeing what would happen if I took my cue from watching Misery's fingers hitting the strings. Probably
			easier to follow Agent, honestly, but you don't know until you try. It all held together well, though, and went
			down well with the assembled. In fact the landlady asked for our phone number so that she could book us again!
			Good grief. We gave it to her as well. What were we thinking? We'd just got away with murder, after all.
			<p>
			After the show I enjoyed a pint with Pete Watkins from the Bareback Ryders, handed out a couple of CDs, heard a
			couple more Happy Mondays comparisons and one with Alabama 3. We've got no problem with that short of comparison
			at all. We find it flattering. Thanks. We got invited to play a party in NN1. We had another beer and packed up.
			<p>
			Then something rather strange came to pass. Looking out of the pub window I saw a large minibus, engine running,
			with members of the group climbing aboard. Instinct takes over at times like this. I had been told that Guy had
			laid on a ride home for us at about 1:00am. And yet here at midnight stood The Bus before my very eyes. Well, of
			course, that was me on board with all my kit. Turned out to be completely the wrong bus. Missed the party after
			the gig. Bah. Never mind - back to MC Bot's and from there to liquor-induced oblivion.
			<p>
			So we got away with playing the village pub. An away win, we all agreed. And, as I said to Misery, when I'm up
			there on the stage at Cargo with that big old Turbosound system and all those fancy lights and shit, I shall
			remember where it was that I played the gig before that.

			Greetings from the geriatric ward...
			<p>
			This has not been Headstone's week. First the fool managed to up-end himself, tripping over his treasured
			skinning-up granite and sailing through the air with Klinnsman-like grace (Arsene Wenger is reported to have said "I
			did not see eet"). This left him with a massive limp. Then he caught the flu. Then, even as the foot began to
			improve, he developed the most god-awful low back pain as a result of his ludicrous gait earlier in the week. To cap
			it all he tried to pass a speaker cabinet to Misery at soundcheck, emitted an unearthly wail and went down flat on
			the floor of the venue. Those familiar with the floor of the venue will realise that he was notÂ  kidding.
			<p>
			The occasion was the Great Yvette Bailey's birthday party, ensuring a well respectable turn-out and a nice
			atmosphere as DJ Neil span a fantastic succession of classic reggae 45s.
			<p>
			Wilson took the stage just after ten. With lighting genius Johnny P unable to make this show, the stage was shrouded
			in darkness as the infamous "Sheep Tape" began to roll, leading eventually into a version of God's Green Earth that
			immediately suggested that this might turn into a bit of a night. And that is what came to pass. Although barely
			able to move, the plucky guitar scientist was seriously "on", and he was not alone. With the lights never really
			rising above an eerie glow, this was a dark and ferocious set. MC Bot fronted accordingly, with apparently random
			cries of "Shit!" and "Fuck!" between the tunes. (Occasionally Mister E. Wilson could be heard translating: "Botty
			says Thank You.") Stevie G delivered great squalls of guitar noise across Police Chief and Buffalo Sniper. Misery
			was magisterial throughout, even when tunes turned up in the set completely without warning. Agent Wilson
			was...leaping.
			<p>
			So a bit of a triumph in the face thereof, then. Everyone well pleased and off up the Bradlaugh, thence to the

			into a big spacious dub. How can they be doing that, though? I'm bloody sure it's all coming off a tape.
			Special guest vocalist and leader of the "Free World" (tm) G-Dub announces the End of the Civilised

			I was only supposed to play for 30 minutes or so, and I was going to stop after "Play It All Night Long",
			but there was a bit of a shortage of acts, so I ended up bluffing my way through an extra half hour. Seemed
			to go down all right, though. Expect another gig a little bit like this one on Friday 5th December at the
			Labour Club once again. Yeah, I might play "White Christmas". Then again, I might not...

			It was a bit terrifying, as I found myself obliged to go on after two Northampton rappers, who call themselves,
			triumphantly, The Shit. As in "To the S...to the H...to the I...to the T...MC Burt Reynolds on the M-I-C." No,
			really. They were really good. They're gon' kick our asses higher than the Express Lifts tower. We're gonna try and
			get them on with Wilson, maybe on Christmas Eve.
			<p>
			Anyway...coming on after The Shit was tough, especially as I'd elected to play Nature Boy for a starter. Hardly the
			"breezy opener", but it went down all right. Things went fairly swimmingly until towards the end of Harlan, which I
			found myself obliged to finish with 5 strings. I switched to the Burns and carried on, but I lost sight of my sound,
			got clumsy, hit the pickup switch a few times when I didn't mean to...all a bit scrappy, really. Didn't dig it.
			Satellite of Love felt like a big mistake (doing this was - indirectly - your fault, Brian Kelly...) Some dignity
			recovered during Honey and the deeply inappropriate Neil Young cover. Noisy ending. Happy, baying punters. Encore.
			Not really satisfied with the performance, though. I'm trying to get this shit good, but I didn't really have the
			time to sort myself out for this night. Small difficulties threw me off course more than I would have wished for.
			<p>
			I think they're having me back in February. Folks, I promise I'll have a proper solo set sorted out by then. Honest.
