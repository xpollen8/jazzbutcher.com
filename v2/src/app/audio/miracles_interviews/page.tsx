Or could it sit at the desk if you like and then have it right between us? Sort of. It's up to you. Yeah. That's that's fine.

Mhmm. Testing. Yeah. Let's get let's get in something. Talky.

Talk. Talk. Oh, yeah. I see a little waveform happening there. It's pretty tiny.

Yes. It's, it I don't know where the mic is on the phone. I'm terrible if I touch these things. They usually go wrong. Do we have a larger wave oh, oh, it's a beauty.

Oh, I had no idea my voice looked so nice. And now I I I was I was, searching earlier to see if I could do something clever like, audio to tech to to text machines Oh, wow. Which is which is a capability that some machines possess. But They do get it wrong, though. You see it on the BBC.

They they they mishear things terribly. So, but I I I haven't found anything properly. And it might come to me just doing a little bit of transcribing. And I may not even really properly transcribe. It's just to get some ideas really more than anything.

Yeah. And I was, you know, I was saying yesterday about, what we were talking about, the concordance and how we might try and think about picking out some low level detail Yeah. That Deep detail. That that requires, description and further explanation and indexing and cross referencing and lots of complicated stuff like that. Oh, it's bloody Susie again.

Yeah. Oh, there she is. And it and and it all made sense because it links with Sometimes they do. Sometimes it looks like I'm playing the long game, but most of the time I'm just lucky. And there have been incredible schoolboy errors.

And this is one that I only noticed when they reissued Cult of the Basement recently. I hadn't heard that record in ten years, and I'd never heard it as a CD, as a sort of one one way trip all the way through. So when it arrived, Raul and I sat down. He was on the sofa with me, and we just we scan up, scun up, and we put it on. And at the end of it, I was quite shaken.

I said to Raoul, well, that was a ride. And he went, who's it? Where's uncle? But I noticed after sort of, what, twenty five, thirty years. I don't even know how long.

One of my favorite songs. Oh, for fuck's sake. Excuse me. They do. Yeah.

But sometimes you get caught out. I was out there with the band, and we were actually starting with quite jazzy stuff with the jump in there. Just to sort of ease ourselves in because these weren't places where they knew us at all. Yeah. And after the first night, this time I come up with it.

Oh, god. I'm They're up in the cafe next door. Every now and then, they come in and give me about three loaves of bread. Sometimes I get cake. Perfect.

So they're in operation on a Sunday then? Yeah. He's very curious. I lent him some records, and he he kind of dug them. And he's very curious.

But he's nice. I like him. And there's a cafe next door. I I used to sit here in the nineties darkly predicting that if this gentrification luck goes on much longer, then I have pavement cafes on Going Road. Yeah.

Sure enough. Yeah. They haven't gone gone as far as putting, chairs and tables on the pavement. They have little chairs out in the afternoons. Yeah.

Wow. People all hot. People sit outside my window and have a nice chat. It's like, fuck off. I'm recording.

So recording, Cult of the basement, schoolboy era. One of my favorite songs on that is Daycare Nation. And in Daycare Nation, the lyric mentions thousands of Mister Odds living inside of Royal Oak Station. Three songs later or something like that, we're introduced to mister Odd. Schoolboy era.

Took me thirty years to notice. There's a sequencing error. Yeah. Yeah. And my god, the sequencing for that record.

Oh my goodness. We had this whopping great map of all the different little tiny bits of music we'd recorded. Because we didn't just do the songs. We did all these daft things as well. Thing, babies, and Hawaiian guitars and stuff.

All this old nonsense. Yeah. That's actually it's not Hawaiian guitar. It's Lawrence playing a fretless bass with his, Zippo Alright. With his lighter.

It's a technique that he perfected on slow evenings. Sounds sounds Hawaiian and slidey. Yeah. I mean, there's there's we lost the Great Euphrates in San Francisco, so it's not entirely inappropriate. Well, what was the Great Euphrates?

The Great Euphrates, I think I may have a picture of him, was, Oh, a person? Sort of. He was a plastic lobster about this size who had been spray painted gold. And Lawrence bought him off a street guy in New York City, Basically, because the guy had pointed out, it makes a great conversation piece. And he wasn't kidding.

We had conversations about Euphrates all the way across The US. And there's I think there's a photograph of us. We took him into a diner and put him in a highchair. We're very fond of you, Fraisees. And at the gig in San Francisco, he disappeared.

Lawrence was absolutely beside himself. And eventually, just we just had to admit the great Euphrates had legged it. I figured he'd made made for the bay and just gone to rejoin its people. You were carrying around plastic, plastic dinosaurs at one point as well. We had a couple of plastic dinosaurs during the making of Cult of the basement.

They were parked on the, on the desk. And one of them was called Egulos. I can't remember what the other one was called. It might have been Mantaor. I'm not sure.

But And you're quite keen on these pictures of, of dinosaurs meeting Jesus? And, I kinda collect them. Yeah. Because it's, you know, it's some of those American evangelical fundamentalist televangelist people, you know, the guys who want to live like it's Saudi Arabia, those guys. They are so mixed up about dinosaurs.

Yes. From the creation. The it's all archbishop Butler's fault, isn't it? Was that his name, Butler? He some point in the nineteenth century, he'd he just decided that that he'd worked it out by reading his bible and doing genealogies and that.

He'd worked it back. And he The Earth was created in on a Tuesday, April 04/2004. Yeah. Yeah. It's all his fault.

Yeah. It should have been really revolutionary, really, this the the Victorians digging up fossils in Purbeck and the like. Yeah. You you'd imagine. I mean, it must have been quite controversial.

And, I mean, some of the early projections of what they dug up turned out to be wildly inaccurate. And we're still laboring with that. We're still laboring with this saurus idea. Mhmm. The whole lizard thing.

You know, if there was a book came out in, I think, the late seventies. It was called The Hot Blooded Dinosaurs. It revolutionized my way of seeing the world, really. One of the most persuasive arguments you'll ever see against dinosaurs as reptiles is that they calculated how long a stegosaurus would need to bask in the sunshine before it had absorbed enough energy to get up and walk around. And the figure they came up with, given the bulk of the creature and the surface area and the strength of the sun back in them days, Five days.

Not accounting for heat loss at night. They just you look at some of them things. They're like you know, you look at the T Rexes and that. Those things are built for speed. The idea that they've just got to stand there and warm up for two and a half hours before they can actually chase you is fatuous.

So pterodactyls covered in snow white fur. Mhmm. You know? That's real. That I have no imagination.

You're you're gonna find this. You're gonna get really bored with this project really quickly because, like, it's all just stuff that I've seen or heard. But but I I I think I always think more and more that if you, you know, if you want to see evidence of, dinosaurs Oh. Then you only need to look at birds as we were saying last night. You know, there's a there's a direct correlation between the intelligence of crows and, you know, even the the birds the the non flying birds that look more like your your raptors.

Your cassowaries and things like that. Yeah. Yeah. They're obviously, They're visually the same animal, aren't they? I mean, look at the feet.

Look at the feet. Come on. And, you know, what you have to say about that also is that you have to understand that they've got sixty seven million extra years of evolution behind them. We've been around for, like, those guys, they've been around so long. They can fly.

If they wanna go to Africa, they just go to Africa. They know the way. And yet their brains are these tiny things that weigh nothing. And we say birdbrain as an insult. It's mad isn't it?

Those guys. You see the the swifts that have come over here in the summer, and you see them hunt. It's, you know, you wouldn't wanna be an insect. You really wouldn't. It's like a mad killer ballet.

And the way they operate is extraordinary. The fact there's never a collision is in itself remarkable. I wanted to talk a bit about, quite a bit about wildlife Yeah. Which we sort of onto a little bit. And, and particularly, you know, the piss poor Midwest rock display.

Do you know who that is? No. No. That's Guns N' Roses. Oh, is it?

We had a I mean, I I see yeah. There's a lot needs explaining, but it it all happened quite quickly. It was the '88, and we were on a five week tour of The US. And Los Angeles is pretty much the end of it. We started in New York City, made our way along the sort of Canadian border and down.

Yes. And, yeah, pretty road hardened. Knew what we were doing. And in New York, Phil, the driver, started it. He was driving around in the rented van with the windows down, his elbows sticking out, playing Public Enemy at full blast.

I'm a sucker to decide I know you hate my '98. It's a Ford. It's a Ford van. You know? But we've been playing your records since we left New York.

That's gonna come up. Yeah. So we arrive in Los Angeles, and it's a weird it's not a hotel. It's one of these sort of, like, apartment block thingies, like the Tropicana of infamy, but, happily, a lot cleaner and tidier than that. But we're trying to get the van into subterranean parking, and there's a whole load of pipes and shit in the roof.

And it is it's not even touch and go. It's scrape and hope. Now we don't care what happens to the roof of the van, but I, for one, am terrified that we're gonna blow a gas pipe or something or, like, have sewage suddenly come all over us. You know? So while we're all sat on the van, sitting there, sort of going, oh, fuck.

Oh, fucking hell. We become aware that we are being subjected to a hail of abuse from one of the balconies at the front of the hotel. And looking up, we see these pathetic, hairy, fucking relics of another age. Sweaty, fat kids in shit clothes, All on their balcony with a couple of beers, you know. All going, hey, you lame assholes.

You can't even break your fucking van. And all this kind of shit. Right? And, like, you know, we're a little bit tense about this fucking van business anyway right now. And, these geezers are yelling at us, and we respond as that generation of the band would respond.

Why in the winters take a fuck off you long hair, cunts. And that was the first time we met Guns N' Roses. Oh, my god. And I was immediately contemptuous because, oh, I thought you were supposed to be an LA band, But you're staying in a hotel like people from London. You know?

What's that about then? And, of course, later on, you find out that Axel and his mates come from, like, butt fuck Idaho or something. You know? Midwest rock display. So that's them.

The funny joke is that we're not alone, them and us, in this hotel. There's another band in residence. As I find out when I go in the elevator and find myself face to face with Flavor Flav with his clock on. He's like, where you're from, man? He's like, I'm from London.

He goes, London? Yeah. I've been to London on two world tours. And I'm stood there thinking, well, what the fuck do you think I'm doing here? But I say, nothing.

You go, you don't love black folks in London? I said, yeah, man. They're all over the place. That's French far and wide. Yeah.

So, like, that that happened. And it turned out my room was to directly beneath the room of Chuck d. And my wife had come out to join us at this point, so having my own room with my own wife was kinda cool. What kind of took the erotic edge off it a little bit was upstairs Chuck in all night heated debate with his crew all going, yo. Yo.

Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo.

You can't say no. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo.

All night long. Obviously, they just fucking stoned out their gourds and being all fucking you know? This is important. And the following day, Kizzy and me went for a swim in the little hotel pool. And who do we find ourselves in the pool with?

Chuck D and Flavor Flav. So it's you know, there's no imagination in it. It all just that's what happened. And, yeah, we we found the company of Public Enemy a great deal more agreeable than that of, the hairy twats from Bumfuck, Idaho. I I imagine that there was some some real wildlife involved.

There was something about, you know, captive dolphins or some thing or dolphins on display that maybe I'd rather infer that. No. I mean, really, when I say wildlife, I've got my big irony hat on because we are the wildlife. We're the freaks. You know?

Like, the white Americans scream abusers. The black Americans just fucking curious. You know? We must study them. And so it was like, we're the wildlife, basically.

Hey. Hey. Yeah. And and and Kizzy walking up to the bad man. Iain O'Higgins, who mixed Fiscotech and then he joined us as a live sound man.

It was just one of the great jazz butcher cliches. You know Higgins? He's a very, very, very bad man. That's just one of them things. He's a boy.

A very, very, very bad man. He, unfortunately, man, he looked and sounded just like Bob Geldof. It was it really was nuts. And so yeah. Oh, that's all Higgins.

He's a very, very, very bad bad bad man. And that weekend when we checked into that little fucking apartment hotel complex, the first night, Higgins went off to a party with some of our mates in LA. And, you know, I was I was busy being wifed, so I didn't really clock any of this. But Higgins took the band bag apart to the party with him. Gizzy, who just he was clearly planning on just spending an evening in his hotel room smoking until he couldn't see, discovered this and became so enraged that he ordered a taxi.

He had himself delivered across town to this party when stopping him, walked straight up to O'Higgins and clocked him one. It's very, very, very, very uncharacteristic Kizzy behavior, but it had obviously been building in him ever since he made the discovery of what had happened. He's just been building and building and building, and so I'm gonna thump him. I didn't imagine he was one of your party. I I imagine he was someone else.

So that's, that's helped clear Yeah. Something up. Yeah. The bad man is Higgins. Sometimes sometimes I thump him just for fun.

And the other thing with Higgins is that, there's rule in that generation, the JVC, because we didn't know each other very well when we started out. We we were sort of assembled a bit like, you know, blue or five or something by McGee. And because I'd seen what happened with the last lot because they didn't know what they were getting into. I didn't with this new lot, very early on, we set down a whole sort of bunch of almost like rules. We called it the Rennes Accords because it was done in Rennes.

And that enabled the system of sanctions, chief amongst which was the head slap. There was a there was an ultimate sanction, which was the bus slap, and only one of those was ever administered. Oddly enough, to O'Higgins. The charge we all saw it. We we were we were all there late night in a Turkish run pizzeria in provincial Austria.

That's fair. Yeah. All the pizzerias in Germany and Austria are Turkish. Yeah. And late at night, the guys are obviously tired of us.

We've had our pizzas, and the guys were standing there. Right? Who wants who wants dessert? And who wants dessert? Come on.

Come on. Hurry up. And Higgins has obviously decided he wants some dessert. And so he goes, I do in a Turkish restaurant in Austria. Well, we decided that such a case of bringing the game into disrepute merited the ultimate sanction.

And the following morning at the gas station, you got a bus slap. So the bus slap is? They drive the bus at you and you get hit by it. They don't do it very fast. And and, I think it's still with us, is he?

Yeah. Bless him. He met a friend of ours out there, Nancy McCoy, and he married her. And they've got two lovely grown up daughters now. And, yeah, they're disgustingly happy.

It's a funny thing, Nancy. You could do a chapter on Nancy all by herself. When we first met her, she was working for the record company that put out bloody nonsense over there at the compilation. And she when we got to LA where she lived, she also turned out to have this band Downey Mildew. And, they supported us a lot.

They came on tour with us in '88. Seeing them in Canada was hilarious. All of them just like born and bred Californians. Some of them Mexican. And to see them in Saskatchewan was a joy.

You know? It's like you you think, oh, yeah. Britain, America, Canada, it's all the same. No. Forget it.

It was like Hungarians in Portugal. And so, yeah, it was on that '88 tour that I made my big mistake. On the previous trip in '86, Max and Owen had both fallen in love head over heels in love with Nancy. Graham probably hadn't noticed that she was there. But what goes on in Graham's mind is another chapter, one that should probably best be remain unwritten.

And so those two in '86 just flipped for Nancy. In '88, Paul Mulraney just went, oh, Nancy, I'm gonna marry you. And as we can see from the subsequent evidence, so did Higgins. And, when my wife came to join us on that tour on the West Coast, we were in it happened in Seattle. We'd done the gig.

We were hanging around, I think, a gay bar. And so things are a little bit tense because they were a bit resentful that we'd brought a couple of girls with us. It all panned out fine. But she had noticed that Paul was very taken with Nancy. And she remarked upon this this to me, and very, very carelessly, because of Max and Owen and Higgins and Paul, I just went, ah, yeah.

All the musicians love Nancy. Forgetting, schoolboy error, that I too am a musician. Small angry New York American wife, she hadn't forgotten I was a musician. She started kicking me in the shins, and to this day, I have footballer's legs. That when I when I went for treatment at the hospital, the doctor looked at my legs and went, what the fuck is that?

I said, that is a small angry New York punk rock girl kicking me in his shins. You know? Right. Yeah. Got a different one here, boss.

I don't I don't know if those hospital guys really care if you're different. You know? I mean, you're probably just another tumor to them. But they are awfully nice. I don't know.

To the these the people that didn't make it and the the the ones that can't be here stay with you. Dust diffs. They haven't passed the they're definitely dead. So how do we go? Greg Shaw?

Yes. Greg Greg Shaw was the boss of Bomp Records. Yeah. I've I've I've looked them up. Yeah.

I've I've I've tried tried to guess. Yeah. And and the connections. Well, the reason I got friendly with Greg was through Sonic Sonic Boom. Yeah.

I saw that he released some Space Men 3 stuff. Yeah. And he he gave me one of those lovely posters for that American tour that never happened because they never got let in. Alright. But, yeah, Sonic brought him around here one night.

I I knew of him from, like, you know, rock history, but I'd never met the guy. And Sonic brought him around, and we got on really well. And then I was a year or two later, I was in Los Angeles, and, he took me clubbing to the most ridiculous nightclub I've ever been to. And he was saying really daft things like, wow. This is the most exciting thing I ever seen since the Grateful Dead man.

And he's a sweetheart. But then he died. So he can't be there. And, I I you know, I saw this the title of this this zine that, he created in the sixties, which was a really cool title of Mojo Navigator. Have you heard of that?

I didn't know that one. No. Yeah. It's That's a good title. It it's, it's sort of, cited as inspiration for Rolling Stone magazine.

Yeah. Well, everyone's got a cross to bear. Sometimes, like, they don't they seem to have gone away now, but there was a a a terrible period of life where there was a thing called the Barenaked Ladies that came from Canada. Yeah. I understand.

And once or twice, I saw them doing their witty, ironic Canadian songs on a telly or on the radio. And as my flesh crept against my bones, I began to think, Christ. I hope this isn't my fault. Oh, Canadian rock. Canadian rock.

Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. We've got some unlikely friends on the Canadian rock scene. We, had quite a nice round about the time of the '88 tour again, we seem to be keep coming back over and over to '88. But that was when we made friends with Skinny Puppy.

Celebrated industrial animal anarchists. They were actually just sweet Canadian boys who like our songs about elephants. Very nice chaps. And then Donahue, is that John O'Donahue? No, sir.

That is Deirdre O'Donahue. Alright. Okay. She was a DJ on a station called KCRW out of Santa Monica. And KCRW is still going today, and it's still the best place to hear, like, original music in Los Angeles.

And she used to get us in there and play our records and just a really good mate. And once I went on holiday with Deirdre by mistake. And what a story that was. Should I? I don't know.

I mean, there's so much of this stuff. Yes. Expand. You see, I I I I I I'm, I was taken completely down a dead end Yeah. By just the surname.

So, you know, so I Googled O'Donoghue and the the person that turns it is John O'Donoghue. Have you heard of him? Irish poet, priest, philosopher, fan of Hegel. No. No.

I didn't know about him. Exactly. Sounds sounds like your cover too, actually. Died in 02/2008. I thought this is perfect.

He's a dead man. That'll be him. He's a poet. Philosopher. Yeah.

Yeah. No. No. Deidre was a poet in her own way, I guess. She was very, very good at talking on the radio.

Our first face to face encounter with her came in '89. She'd expected us to go and do a thing with her on the '88 tour, but we were too busy going swimming and just being flaky. And we didn't know we were supposed to go. And when we arrived at the Roxy that night for the soundcheck, we were delivered of just enormous pile of Tiffany posters. Big posters of Tiffany.

Hundreds of them with a note going, that's for not turning up you assholes or something like this. Right? And we didn't even know. Turning up to what? What what's this all about?

And we just took the Tiffany posters, and we just did the whole fucking stage. Just millions of Tiffany's. And the next year, she and the tour manager cooked it up that we would go in and we would play live in her studio, live to air. Only the tour manager only told us this on the afternoon as we drove towards the place. And we're all in a blind we're all in a blind funk like.

Live? To air? Oh, they're in in Los Angeles, where all our fans live. Christ. You know?

What the fuck? So we put put our feet down. She said, right. She gets two numbers. She'll interview.

Two numbers by the band. That's it. No more. Two numbers. So we get settled in.

We have a little sound check somehow. Headphones and that. All in the room together. And, our pals showed up. Downey Mildew, Nancy's band.

They're all in the control room along with our crew. And this Deirdre who's sat there talking to us down the headphones, and, oh, dear, she's got a voice for radio, this girl. She ends up getting 13 songs out of us just coaxing and cajoling. And if the bloody thing ever comes out, that whole session is going to be in the next box set with all the a sides and b sides. So I divided into a sides, b sides, c sides.

And being a Santa Monica is sea side. And that's like the whole session. I've taken out the interview stuff because it's a bit like, you know, when when it's the wildlife thing again. I can hear myself in the interview, you know, taking the piss out of people who are now dead. So I'm not gonna put that out for money.

So we just said, no. Just leave the music. You do hear her voice once or twice, so you can just hear her introduce in a couple of little bits and pieces. But, oh, yeah. She totally cajoled us.

And after that, we were great mates, and I used to go and, like, always see her when I was over there. We weren't lovers or anything. She had a bit of an unfortunate history of accidentally sleeping with pop musicians, but I wasn't one of them. I think that's why she liked me. And then and she and she must have died around the same sort of time before you wrote all that?

Yeah. She went sometime in the early two thousands. She lived alone. Nice little house in Santa Monica. I've been there.

And, yeah, nobody saw her for a while, and a couple of coppers went in, just found her face down on the floor in the living room. Just went over. And it was funny. I I, you know, I felt sad at the time, obviously, lose a mate. But some strange little thing happened months months later.

I was not thinking about her at all, and some record came on. And it was just bang! It was like being punched in the head. The tears came. I was like, proper well, grief surprise.

You know? Terrible. Can't even remember what the record was that triggered it now. But chances are that helped to trigger writing Wildlife. Also, chances are I was probably upper I I know for a fact.

I was operating very much under the influence of of the fact that I'd just been to see John Kale performing Paris 1919 live on the South Bank with an orchestra. Yeah. And, you know, that that is there are complete lifts. You know, everything's burning, isn't it? Brentwood's burning the upline.

It even be posh part of town. You know? That's a direct lift from the middle of, Antarctica Starts Here. And then it gets worse. It goes And that, again, I mean, you know, I haven't even bothered to repaint the bike.

I've just stolen it. It's just a complete lift. I just it wasn't done for, like, great release. It was done for Graham's Northampton compilation. Yes.

And it felt like a chance to do something a little bit daft without really incurring anyone's grief, anyone's Yeah. I was I was surprised by that. It wasn't, it wasn't turned into something grander for a for a formal release. It would have been nice, I think. Well, these things It seems like, you know, it it, you know, it could, it would it would survive a grand makeover, you know, being polished up and, and expanded Yeah.

With strings. Almost. Possibly. Yeah. I mean, these things can lie around like unexploded ordnance from a forgotten war and then suddenly turn up much, much later.

And it seems if if if So it's not impossible. It might appear. It feels like, sort of three three or four songs in one. You know? A hard rain has fallen.

We haven't we haven't covered Alex or Nikki yet. Nikki Sudden, I met very, very early on. Dave Barker knew him. And Dave Barker at Glass Records says the man who changed my life. The man to whom I owe my life.

I don't mean he stopped me from being killed, but the life I've had is entirely the responsibility of Dave Barker. I I take no responsibility for any of it myself. So he has a lot to answer for. But no. I mean, without without Dave, I would have had a completely different life is what I'm saying.

No one else would have given me the, the oxygen to get away with what I did. Because and talk about growing up in public. You know? More so than McGee then. You know?

Well, I mean, I the when Alan came along sort of at the right time, I'd sort of forgotten about him, and I assumed that he'd pretty much forgotten about me. But he hadn't. He tracked me down. I didn't even realize the glass contract had run out. So I you know, young bands will sit where you're sitting, and they will say, Uncle Pat, Uncle Pat, you've had record deals.

How do you get one? And I go, I have no idea. Because if they want you know, if people wanna put you out, they'll come to you. Right? Put you out sounds like prostitution, which it sort of is.

If they want to, balance you on a little stool in a little window somewhere. They'll do it. Oh, I'm bloody certain I must have been balanced on stools in windows at various stages. I was thinking the other night about a venue in Belgium that we went to. The town is called Hoekstraaten, which translates just as high street, and that's pretty much what it was.

It was after playing in Brussels, this was a little bit comedown. You know? And the venue was more like a sort of cafe with a big glass fronted window and all that. So it made me think of it. And it all seemed a little bit tame and provincial and not really the thing for the last night of this leg of the tour.

So we were setting up and making the best of the little PA and that, and I was talking to the barman. I was saying, so, what time do you go? What time do you chaps close then? Fearing he might say, like, oh, eleven. You know?

Leaving us stranded in Hoekstraaten. I said, so what what what time do you chaps close this evening? He says, well, it's supposed to be five, but you know? Yeah. Sorry I asked.

And we missed the boat home the next day. The Domino's Pizza in Leicester, where I've just driven from, is, open till 5AM, seven days a week. Wow. Who needs pizza at five in the morning on a Tuesday? Bad people.

Whatever they're doing with that pizza, they're up to no good. God. Lord. So yeah. Nicky Sudden.

Sorry. Dave Barker introduced me to him. Somehow because, I mean, Nikki had been in Swell Maps and was a regular on John Peel and in the NME. And to me, he was a real pop star. You know?

Yeah. But somehow, Dave persuaded him to support me and Max at a little gig here in Northampton. And, that's where I met him. He turned up very, very late, came shambling in in his crushed velvet jacket and his flappy trousers and his, like, you know, scarves. And he had a girl with him who I'd seen once or twice at gigs in London.

She's a kind of scene girl. I think she might have been called Emily. And, she came steaming in. Sudden literally, the first thing that Sudden said to me was, so has anybody got any drugs? First thing.

She goes, this is Nicola. Nicola has syphilis. Yeah. For yes. I remember it verbatim.

Yes. I was freaking out. I said, oh, no. What am I involved with now? And what was most comical about it was he stayed the night.

And my girlfriend, who was quite a bit younger than me, she was about 18, and not that worldly, not that well versed in musician humor, soon as he left the following lunchtime, she's running around going burn the sheets. Burn the sheets. I I was surprised that he released 13 studio albums I read. I'm surprised it's that few, honestly. He just worked and worked and worked.

Have you have you heard them all? No. No. We got to be good pals, though, and we both spent a lot of time in Germany. So we'd always be, like, bumping into each other on things, which was really nice.

And, I also read that he was with Creation and Bomp, which takes us back to To Greg. Yeah. To Greg. So Greg must have released one or two of either the Jacobites or his albums through Bomp in The US, I guess. I would think he probably did something for Sudden.

Yeah. I think the Jacobites go through, Secretly Canadian over there. I think. I don't know. Dave Dave Barker's the man.

He knows all the tie ups. Because, like, back I can remember back in the day in '86, he put out a record of the Replacements. And he did a swap for the Jacobites with a Minneapolis label called Twin Tone. It all comes rushing back. Yeah.

He he got, I think, an album and a compilation out of the Replacements, and they got Jacobites and Robespierre's. But I think these days, someone else does it. And, one of one of his album titles jumped out at me. It's called from from the Warwick Road to the Banks Of The Nile. And I and I didn't know.

You know, there maybe isn't a connection between that and the East Of The Nile, West Of The Rockies. Yeah. East Of The River Nile. It's an LP by, oh, come on, Augustus Pablo. The guy with the melodica, in fact.

Oh, right. Oh, okay. And it's it's a real spooky reggae classic. It's a beauty. Nothing to do with Nicki then?

On this in this case, no. No. I've got a bad feeling that Nicky was I think Alex was the last one to be added to the the death toll in the last verse. Nicky died Nicky died in 2006. '6.

Yeah. Yeah. And and Alex in '10. Yeah. And it the song was written in '10.

So, yeah, Alex would have been the last one on. I can't remember who had his place before. Isn't that awful? Just before we leave Nicky for a second. So much to say about Sudden.

Yeah. There's there's, He's got his own book though. Right? Yeah. It's written, I think.

I haven't read it, but it's there. I saw it last night. And, obviously, a lot is made of this, Death is Hanging Over Me. Which he must have must have been a regular of his, I guess, his set, the fact that he's singing it. I guess.

The one I always remember him singing is Baby, I'm the last bandit. I can you know, he'd turn up at a gig in Nuremberg, barge his way onto the bill. And while you were hoping to do a soundcheck, Nicky would be up there with his acoustic out of tune going, Baby, I'm the last bandit. And you're kinda, really? I used to think you were a proper pop star.

But, of course, he always was. You know, fucking Mick Taylor from the Rolling Stones turned up at his funeral. Oh, wow. Which, you know, Kusworth was denied. Isn't that mad?

When Stevie Garafalo died, we all went piling up to the church service. And afterwards, nine of us came back here, all gentlemen, all in suits. And we sat around drinking beer and smoking pot and ruminating. And it went you know Tim Harris? Bass player?

Best bass player in the world? Yeah. At one point, he just went someone remarked on how smart he was looking, and he went, yeah. Yeah. I really like to wear a suit.

It's it's just a shame that someone's got to die. That's become a bit of a staple around this house. So the old adage about, you know, weddings and bar mitzvahs and funerals. Have you played at a funeral? Not yet.

Would you? Yep. If you're invited. If paid. And the collection today is not the Northamptonshire air ambulance.

Wouldn't that be scandalous? Wouldn't that be scandalous? It's like, oh oh, could you could you play Dave's funeral? £150. It'd be worth it.

I'd I mean, actually, yeah, it'd be worth doing it just to see their faces. Glenn Campling got me the other night. I've done this gig with Mickey Greeney up the road. And, Glenn I don't know when Glenn last saw me perform, probably early eighties or something. You know?

And he came up afterwards, and he went, yeah. Lovely, lovely guitar. A lovely performance. It put me in mind of, Duroty Cullum. And I was going, oh, I'll take that.

And without dropping a beat, he just went, singing was shit, though. He's still around, mate. He's I thought he sort of disappeared off the face of the earth. Yeah. Well, for years, he hasn't had anything to do with anybody on the scene.

Yeah. And he jealously hoards all his Bauhaus films and tapes. But the times they are are changing. The guy who brought him down to my thing was, Andy Brooksbank, who used to be just like this mad fan and has lately become sort of the world's leading Bauhausologist. When Dave wrote his the his book, you know, Who Killed Mister Moonlight, he was phoning Andy up to ask him when he did things.

You know? When did this happen? And so he's become, like, an authority now. And it because he will do anything to do with Bauhaus, that that extends as far as me. In fact, at one point, it extended as far as Stranger Tractors.

He was running a Love and Rockets fan scene monthly, and Love and Rockets weren't doing anything. David j wasn't doing anything solo, nor was Danny, nor was Kevin. I wasn't doing anything. Jazz Butcher. But I was playing drums with Curtis.

So he did a whole episode of the Love and Rockets fan scene about bloody Stranger Tractors. That's how keen he is. And he's conducted insanely long interviews with me and Eider where you can see the mental disintegration as the beers go down. You know, you can we just basically stop making any sense, but he doesn't stop asking questions. Sorry.

Talking of that, I've rambled on madly, and I can't even remember what I was supposed to be telling you. Moving on to Alex Chilton. Oh, dear god. Yeah. All these guys have chapters in their own right.

I I saw, you know, there's a definite connection with Alex and your, your leanings. He appeared on he appeared on those two sort of cover tribute albums for Brian Wilson and Tom Waits. And I read that his last studio appearance was on Ray Davies, See My Friends Right. Which which was released after Alex died. He did become friends with Ray Davies.

They they were neighbors in New Orleans. Alright. That's right. Live there? Apparently so.

I didn't know this, but, yeah, they were practically next door neighbors. And, of course, Alex has always loved the Kinks. He used to do Kinks covers even back in Big Star. So, like, no surprises there that they got on. And I went to this rather ridiculous thing at the Barbican Center where they recreate a bunch of young hipsters and the twit from REM, the bass player, the nerd from REM, and Terry Edwards, because they always need someone to MD these things.

Big old ensemble of young hipsters and old heads recreating Big Star third live. And, right at the end of that encore time, on comes Ray Davies to do, I think they did At The End Of The Day. And, you know, I am sitting as close to Ray Davies as I am to you. I've got front row center seat, which I didn't even ask for, let alone pay for. But when I found my seat, that's where it was.

Ray Davies comes running on, and he's a cantankerous champ. He's not happy with the public, really. But tonight, he is just mister good vibes. As soon as he's on, everyone goes nuts. And he's just beaming and radiating love and decency and everything he'd want Ray Davies to radiate.

Now I'm thinking, Fishy, this is the chance of a lifetime. And so because, you know, I'm that close to him. So I just in in all the jolliness that's carrying on, I just go, you dirty goona. There's no way he didn't hear me, but he stayed cheerful because it would have been embarrassing if he'd had a tantrum and stomped off and it was all my fault. That would have been poor.

You've spoken to him, have you? No. Not beyond not beyond that? No. No.

We've never met. I mean, he's just a different world to me. I wouldn't know what to say to him if I did meet him. So I did see a documentary once about his hat. He's I did read his autobiography X-ray, which is a very strange conceit.

I mean, I read through the whole thing, but I wouldn't say that I really understood who was talking at any given point. So he does he does like these oblique takes on things. And yet, you know, his songwriting is so direct and so open and so generous. But in all other departments, he seems to be kinda... What did you think of him, at the twenty twelve Olympics opening?

Didn't see it. Did you know? He's there. He's there between, who would it be? Dizzy Rascal and Good lord.

And some and some northern rock band. What are they called? There's an awful lot of that sort of thing these days. Embrace, Kiesche, Verve. Other northern bands are available.

Shed Seven, for example. Yeah. Three piece guitar, proper slip back hair. I forgot. Not a brassie, though.

No. No. But anyway, you know Rock guys. Ray Ray's there as well, being quintessentially Ray as as they're trying to describe, you know, the the this vast tableau that describes Britain. It was basically a sort of fantastic public display of everything which the government was proposing to destroy over the next half dozen years.

Yeah. Take take take a last look at your NHS. Take a last look at your talented songwriters. Take a last look because in a minute, ain't gonna be nothing left except health insurance and Jessie j. Yeah.

It'd be it'd be nice to do, it'd be nice to do, to have a chat about Sixteen Years or whatever it turned out to be probably seventeen years plus the next ten, plus the next six. Yeah. Sort of continuation. Yeah. I have a friend who's active.

She's the chairman of Northampton South Labour Party. And she's a nice woman, but she's a bit naive sometimes. She listens to my stuff, and she goes like she said this Sixteen Years, and it's like, oh, oh, that's, that's really political. You should do the political years. Like, you know, like the violent years, you should do the political years.

And I say, yeah. But do you know how many of these there are? You know? And and and really, assembling them like that. I mean, Mind Like a Playgroup is political after its own fashion.

You know, it's a it's a party political broadcast for the Syd Barrett turn you back and walk away party, but it is in its own little way. You know, if if if some angst ridden Midwestern American kid can write emo anthems and say, you know, oh, it's it's it is political, though, whether you choose to eat broccoli or not, then I can say that Mind Like a Playgroup for all the noises on it. It's conceived I think probably if there was a model for that song, it's a kind of idiot version of, Jug Band Blues, isn't it? By who? Sorry.

Syd Barrett. Alright. That's, the last song he recorded with Pink Floyd. And people Nick Kent famously said, oh, Jug Band Blues, the most searing self diagnosis of schizophrenia ever committed to vinyl. Mad sits back.

Right. Okay. What it is and you can deconstruct it line by line, and I can do chapter and verse on this. I could I you could get a book out of my thoughts about Jug Band Blues. What it is, it's just a massive fuck you to Roger Waters.

That's what it is. And there's a fabulous TV thing shot at a stage late in 1967 when Syd is supposed to be just too mad to operate. You know? We we had to stop picking him up because he was just too mad. They booted him out in January, and this film was done the previous month, December.

And he's there. Christ knows who decided to put Jug Band Blues on the telly, but they did. And, he's there obediently miming, lip synching, Bang on it. Professional. But at the same time, looking really strange and, like, you get to the very end of the song.

It goes mental. It falls to pieces. There's a brass band. There's a load of Syd just going on his guitar for few minutes, and then it fades back up to just him alone with the guitar. Strumming just these last few chords.

And the last lines of the song is, "And what exactly is a dream? And what exactly is a joke?" And on his TV broadcast, as he sings that last word joke, he just turns around and fixes Roger Waters with the stare. That ain't, mental illness. That's something else.

Oh, that's something else that is. There was a there there's another, sort of maybe only slightly veiled political comment about, in one of, the Jasper Tzu songs about, Care in the Community. As a reference somewhere, it escapes me. Well, you got your day care nation, but that was just really us being irresponsible with Sonic Youth's titles. Yeah.

I don't know. I mean, there's there's a whole song about Ben Silcock on Waiting for the Love Bus. Yeah. Do you remember him? Yeah.

Jumped in with the Lions. Yeah. What fascinated me was that everyone I heard talking about it were just being really hostile to him. There's a guy who goes, stupid man. Bloody hell.

Really putting him down. Oh, I think, oh, I hope the lions ate him and all this kind of nonsense. And I'm like, can you can can nobody here see you? This is the act of a really desperate man. You know?

I mean, he needs a fag and a hug, at least. And I I really identified with the cunt, and I remember that Christmas talking to my parents about it, and they were like they they just didn't get it. They're like, well, you're just bothering the lions. They said, but but but but, you know, there but for a traumatic twenty minute episode on a tube train one day, it goes you or I. You know?

What the fuck? So I felt compelled to write the tune. I wonder I I have looked at Ben Silcock, actually, and I wonder wonder if he's still around or if he's whether he's recovered and all of that. Well, of course, who knows? He might have his own lion and tiger sanctuary somewhere in Kent by now.

That'd be nice, wouldn't it? It'd be nice to see a happy ending for once. Folk music. You know, I'm I'm friends with Joe Woolley, and he's deep into all the folk. Yes.

The lords and all that. Yeah. Well, he was singing a song once, old traditional folk song. I think it might be one that they've recorded. No.

I'm talking absolute garbage. It wasn't even Joe that brought me this insight. No. It was when Paul Williams got involved with the producing of that Shirley Collins movie. And well Paul and Tim Harris and I were watching, like, an early version of it, an early cut.

And she performed some old folk song or other. And verse by verse, it dawned on me. Nothing ever gets better in a folk song. You know? They've they they've murdered the daughter in verse three.

And, oh my god, they're going to murder all their children in verse four. You know? Oh, and then they'll all be eaten by a dragon down by the old canal. It's a bit like the the tradition of, of nursery rhymes for children in England. Yeah.

Which, of course The ladybug fly away home. Your your house is on fire, and your children are dead. There's a chap called Rob Chapman who wrote a fantastic book about Syd Barrett. And he points out that Syd, although he's probably only got ten or eleven years on me, he was raised on completely different intellectual diet. To him, Edward, Lear, Hillaire, Belloc, these sort of compendia you used to get, you know, a trial to treasury of verse, that kind of thing.

To him, that would be, like, just what there was. To me, just ten year growing up just ten or twelve years later, there's, like, do not adjust your set and Doctor Who and the Kinks. And if I'm reading anything, it's probably comics. But he's just the tail end of all that sort of you know, people talk about all the the the fairy story type feeling and some of the lyrics on Piper at the Gates of Dawn. And, yeah, it's there.

And in fact, Chapman does a fantastic analysis and finds, like, whole chunks that have been lifted from various bits and pieces. And it's stunning. His Syd's reference points, just a decade away, are utterly alien to the ones that I grew up with. And chances are you as well. I don't know.

Yeah. Yeah. There's a a a a quaintness that disappeared probably in the late fifties and sixties. It's almost like the sort of the English take on psychedelia was almost like a sort of last flowering of that. You know?

It all went pretty Alice in Wonderland and granny spectacles, and it was all a bit airy fairy. Rupert's people. You know? Well, maybe another time. But so so I think, I I have, you know, some ideas about maybe some topics for another time.

So so politics in Sixteen Years plus might be one. We haven't even done Alex. No. We were supposed to do Alex. We never did.

No. Just touched on him briefly and then and then veered off into Ray because he he played that song. That's right. Ray's last or Ray's Well, it was the see my friends album. Yeah.

That's right. Yeah. So yes. Sorry. Tell me about Alex.

As as we were going into that night where Ray's saying that sort of recreation of Big Star three, which they did very earnestly and very well. It's just kinda weird without him. But as we're walking into the Guardian Complex Guardian? Barbican. Barbican.

Yeah. We'd been in this lovely boozer. It was a beautiful May evening, and the the the boozer had a kind of luminaire. So it was getting daylight even, as you say, in the pub drinking. And the last thing I wanted to do is go and see this earnest Q Magazine type rock tribute shit in a great big concrete airport type building.

I wasn't in the mood. And I remember we we made it under the Barbican down to where the center is. And you sort of descend into the concrete bowels, you know. And I turned to my mate, Matt, and I said, you know what? Alex would have fucking hated this.

He would. He'd have run a mile. He'd have gone missing. Not not his environment at all. One of the coolest things he ever said to me I've spent very little time with him, but I remember it well.

But one of the coolest things he said, we were driving through New Orleans, and we passed a club on a corner. And he said, see that club that that's I think he said it was Muddy Waters Club. Yeah. So, well, the Muddy Waters Club. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. That's his club there. Had some of the best nights of my life in there, he says. And I'm like, well, playing.

Yeah? He goes, no. I was the janitor. That's him all over. That's How did you come to meet Alex?

We shared an agent is how it began. In fact, our agent, Frank Riley, rescued Alex. He literally found him face down in the Bowery, and picked him up and went, weren't you Alex Chilton? And he got him a record deal, and as he was quite a high powered agent, he took care of his gigs. And so things, you know, wound up again, and it was time to go on the road.

Alex had a little trio. It was just him and a rhythm section from New Orleans, and they'd just done the High Priest LP. And it was yeah. They wanted to go on tour, and we were coming again, it's the '88 tour again. It's 1988 night.

Can't get away. And as we hit California, we had four days. We had the I Beam in San Francisco. We had two nights at the Roxy. And where was the other one?

I wonder. Could have been Long Beach, maybe. I can I can dig all this out? I've got it all written down somewhere. It was e no.

I think it might have been San Juan Capistrano, actually, where the swallows go. So we had four dates. And here's the thing. Alex Chilton is supporting us. That's the thing.

And the first night, like I say, he's got this very small, very sort of rootsy little band going, and he's singing these largely quite comical and either comical or soulful tunes or mock soulful tunes off of High Priest. And I'm watching at the I Beam from the side of the stage, and, Mulrheaey comes shuffling up beside me. And he goes, who's this old pub rock twat then? I said to him, is he him? That's god, that is.

He's a fuck off. I'm seriously. And, like, you know, a few years later, once the Scream and the Teenage Fan Club and that got into him and started hanging out with him, suddenly, like, everyone at creation is like, oh my god. It's Alex Chilton. I can remember when Mulrheany come and went, who's this old pub rock twat then?

So we got to know him a little bit on that California trip. Not really very well at all, but we we sort of hang out little bit. But then in '92, we went to play in New Orleans, and he came to see us. And everything went terribly, terribly wrong. The tour manager on that trip, who knew him, said that's we were, like, getting out of the van.

So I know he's coming down, and don't give him beer. He's he's cleaning up his act, so don't get him on the on the bit. Well, you can probably imagine what happened next week on the day. Give that advice to you. Yeah.

Yeah. No. I mean, what can you do? Alex Chilton is in your dressing room, and there's beer all over the place. You are forced by all the laws of nature to offer him one.

Right? And, Alex, without making any fuss or bother at all, as well. Thank you very much. And so it began. We were out till seven, I would say, that night.

And the next day, we had a day off in New Orleans, and I thought, oh, that'd be nice. And I went out with Kathy McGinty who was driving on that tour, and we had some lunch. And as we left lunch at about two in the afternoon, we passed a bar. And you know that thing when your mate goes do do do do on the window? That's Alex Chilton.

Alex Chilton is telling me to go to the pub. I'm like, I don't need telling twice. And so it started again, and it went on to about 07:00 the next morning when we ended up in a bar called Roundup, which was a, I shit you not, a transvestite cowboy bar. It's light outside, and I'm in a transvestite cowboy bar with Alex Chilton who is now so pissed that he is making lunges at Kathy McGinty because she's still trapped. You know?

She's been there since lunch. Right? She's still stuck on this Alex train. Yeah. Yeah.

Forty eight hour Alex Chilton Binge. So I got to name a little bit in that time. He's very, very, very courteous man. He said the most outrageously ridiculous thing quite early on when we were still in the dressing room at Tipatina's. He was talking about the scene.

I don't hear a lot of stuff I like these days. I don't think there's anyone out there who's very good apart from you guys, of course. And that's just pure southern manners, isn't it? You know, that is just manners. And, yeah, in interesting fellow.

He really he had that southern thing where he was, like, really did genuinely have a deep interest and belief in astrology and stuff like that. There are a few other names, on in Wildlife. There are a few, aren't there? I can't remember off off the top Sing a song of Jen Jen. She's got a human bone.

1988 again. End of the tour. We've done Los Angeles. Chilton's disappeared back into the mists, and we're hanging around for a day or two for reasons obscure before we fly home. And we go to a party at Downey Mildew's Scaff, which is the Bald Eagle.

It's a disused boozer, which they've kind of, like, taken over down in South Central. And, like, you can go on the roof. It's huge. Charlie's got a big room to do his massive paintings. They've got a little rehearsal space.

You know? It's like we were impressed. And I was up on the roof, smoking a joint, gazing across the scenery. Well, this is South Central, is it? This is where NWA live, is it?

And the singer from Danny Mildew, Jenny Homer, small girl, very intense, incredible singer, but a little bit Californian and witchy for the likes of us peasants from over here. Us scum scarfers as somebody put it the other day. And, yeah, I'm just minding my own business, smoking a joint, enjoying the scene, thinking how cool this all is. And she comes shuffling up with her hands kinda cupped in front of her. And she's, Pat, Jen-Jen, I have in my hand a human bone with this expression of sort of Bjork like delight on her face.

You know? So, yeah, sing a song of Jen-Jen. She's got a human bone. Nancy's driving. That's Nancy McCoy.

There was a celebrated day where some idiot let Nancy drive the, Downey Mildew bus across the Canadian Prairie. And Nancy drove all the way on these perfectly straight empty roads across the tundra. Religiouusly speed of 50 miles an hour all the way. Like, 300 miles or something, driving the rest of the band absolutely crazy. Nancy's driving far from home.

Something about Randy. Now I am at I have been chastised for this by my Los Angeles pals. I'll say Randy was a snake. They go, oh, Pat, don't say that about Randy. He was a good guy and all this kind of thing.

It's like, no. He was a cunt. He had a record label called, I think, Giant. And this concerns the Big Planet Scary Planet record, which we were touring in '88. And were we?

Had we made it yet? No. But we were playing those songs. We oh, no. We weren't.

No. I delude myself. No. No. No.

We weren't playing those songs. Not yet. That was the eighty nine tour. Derailed. Sorry.

I shouldn't have smoked that joint. I've derailed myself. Randy. Put out Big Planet, Scary Planet. So that would have been, like, 89.

And he did a a deal with Creation, and he up fronted $7,000. I don't know what that record sold, but it was, all over the radio. It was all over the whatchamacallit college radio. It's all over the press, charts, things like that, you know, alternative charts, all that kind of thing, CMJ. It was at one point, it was number one on the MTV alternative chart, which was pretty good because we hadn't got a video.

Mhmm. And all the dates were sold out. You know, $7,000. We never saw anything more. That's why I say, Randy was a snake, but I still like it in Silverlake.

And then oh god. Someone was a panther come before him. Harry was a panther. Harry was great. Harry lived with, April and John, as in April, John, and Cole.

John was the drummer in Downey Mildew at the time. April was his gorgeous girlfriend. Again, kind of witchy in Californian, but in a kind of mad Betty Davis sort of Baby Jane sort of a really quiet. Should have been uncool, but it was cool. And they lived happily together with this cat called Harry, who was a big ginger bastard.

He was unnaturally big, and he was still he wasn't even a year old, and he was unnaturally mated with something that wasn't quite a pussycat. And, you know, I like cats, and I would do my best to socialize with Harry. Well, I used to go around there and play a lot of chess, oddly, which I'm shit at chess, but we did. And so word began to leak into the sort of local community that I could handle Harry. Pat can handle Harry.

In fact, this made me unusual. April was terrified of him. And, yeah, we were having that conversation one day. We were having the, Pat can handle Harry come. Harry?

Harry? Conversation. I'm stood there. Harry comes trolling up to me, Bruce stands on my feet, looking up at me. I reach down to go, hello, mate.

He launches himself, claws first, into my face, And I swear I mean, it can't be true. He can't have been there long, but it felt like he was just hanging off my face. All these enormous fucking orange catweight is just hanging off my face. You know, I pack a hell of Harry. So Harry was a panther.

Randy was a snake, but it was alright. And then, yeah, April, John, you know about them. Cole, he's my best mate. He was Downey Mildew's sound man, and he was a really good mate. Liz and Charlie.

Liz is Liz Garrow who's all she's like queen of Los Angeles. She has I don't know if I should take responsibility for this. I I think it's really Liz's fault. And she she runs the Echo now anyway in Echo Park in Los Angeles, rock venue. There's the Echo and the Echo Plex.

A couple of years ago, the Rolling Stones played there. Uh-huh. It's a club. You know? And they did a Stones gig.

And guess who got to get into that for nothing? Yep. Dave J. The universe obeys his every desire. So that's Liz.

And, yeah, the trouble with Liz is that because she knows everybody and because she's so fucking cool, when you're escaping from the Roxy after a gig late at night, and that takes some escaping, not least the bit where you have to drive down the alleyway next to the rainbow room, and there's all these people who wanna be Lemmy wandering around in their ridiculous outfits being drunk. Oh, hello, lads. It's those guns and roses. I just wanna say, hello, lads. And we're in the van just desperately trying to achieve escape velocity and go to a nice, quiet, working men's type bar where we can have a nice, quiet after work pint.

But, you know, maybe the Downies are there, and so maybe they they wanna come and have a nice, quiet pint with us. And, of course, who's friends with them? Liz is friends with them. So the next thing you know, you're driving down Sunset in an easterly direction as fast as you can without causing a fuss. And you become aware that there is a convoy behind you.

And should there be one on the bus, that is when the mobile phone will start to ring. We, with Liz's help, have destroyed so many nice, quiet hangouts and turned them into hipster hell holes over the years. Eventually, in '92, it got so bad that the only place left where we felt safe from the West Hollywood people was this bar down in the depths of god knows where called the Smog Cutter. Scraggy, long haired, bearded Vietnamese veteran in double denim on the door. Angry Chinese or Filipino.

No. Definitely Chinese, bar maids. One of whom is called Sunshine and is given now and again singing sunshine on my face. And when she met me the first time, she just went, will you give us back our Hong Kong? Just like that.

You know? What you are, foo young? I know Chinese people always stand cross, but she really did say like, she went, I say, I ain't got your Hong Kong. You've got a beer. I ain't got your Hong Kong.

And, you know, honestly, hostile place, marginal marginal punters, no decent beer. It's all like Coors or Bud. It's a hellhole. They won't follow us here. Mhmm.

And it's true. In '92, only the very bravest followed us there. They got to witness some shenanigans. The drummer popped out for a bit of fresh air. It was all getting a bit much for the boy.

So he popped out for a bit of fresh air, and he sat down on the pavement with his back to the pub. And I hadn't even noticed he'd gone. But suddenly, there was this big kerfuffle, and the old vet vet on the door was, like, locking bolting up the door and shit. And it was like, oh, what's happening? Are we closing?

What's going on? Oh, there's a gunfight outside. Couple of gangs with machine guns having a war in the street, firing over the drummer's head while he's saying that. So she better get him in. So that's the kind of place it was.

Right? But two years later, I'm reading an American rock magazine of some kind. And it says, Los Angeles' most fashionable new bar is the Smog Cutter ever since KD Lang did an unscheduled appearance there. And I thought, Christ, we've lost that one as well. Even the Smog Cutter has gone down.

And we took out the Dresden rooms. It it was bad enough that we did it. What followed was that David Lynch went there. And David Lynch kinda got into Marty and Elaine, the ancient jazz duo that used to play in there. That was it.

But before Lynch, I can remember flood it I can remember the manager at the Dresden complaining to me because we brought too many people into his bar. I'm like, but isn't that what you no. I'm sorry. Yeah. So we ruined the Dresden.

We ruined the Ski Room before that. We were just a fucking liability because just half the audience would just follow you. You know? It's ridiculous. It's not like it.

Because I I I'm very much aware that it sounds, you know, to say things in this context, the life we lead, to be telling these stories. It does sound as though I've just, like, taken a bunch of acid and made it up. But my guarantee to you, of course, is the fact that I have no imagination. True stories and all that. Yeah.

Yeah. I when people give it in America, they do it a lot. They go like, oh, you're like Robyn Hitchcock. It's like English telecaster suit. Guilty as charged.

You know? But I always say to him that Robyn Hitchcock's got an imagination, and I haven't. And that's how you can tell the difference. I'm just a documentary maker. But, you lie awake at night remembering all those people you've known, which is what And it is all yeah.

It's all true. You see? They're all there. And Cole, yeah, he's really my best mate in LA. I've stayed in his house for ages.

Had all kinds of adventures with him. He was there the night that Greg took us to that mental club in Hollywood. Dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Mummification. They were doing mummification to a soundtrack of, like, depache mode. I got propositioned five times that night all by men. Good looking men at that. I was quite apologetic about the whole business, but it's like, no.

Painfully straight. Quite bewildered at the moment. Don't really like Depeche mode much either. Nice hair. Greg is Greg's running around going, oh my god.

It's the dawning of a new age. It's like, Greg, they're tying each other up in bandages. And Cole. Right? Cole is not a native Californian.

He's originally from Mississippi, and he's got that very grounded southern thing. Don't really take a great deal of shit. And to see Cole at large in this fucking club was just delightful. I mean, he he you know, he he wasn't he wasn't snarky or anything. He wasn't nasty to anybody, but you could just see it.

Oh my goodness. As as were we all. That's the most exciting thing I've seen since the Grateful Dead. Quick. I think it was because he had a new girlfriend, and she was into it.

I think that's why he was getting so excited. I think she just, like, enthused him. I'd rather think that she and I are still in touch on the Facebook. Victoria, her name was. That may be enough for this week, I think.

Yeah. Recording. Are you still are we still I have no idea if it's working or not. It's just sitting here all dark. If not, we're in trouble.

But we've had a great time. Because if I can remember it this time, I can always remember it again. 01/27, that was.

I'll probably be moving in the right direction. I have to say that we, have somewhat been taken over overtaken by events. And that laudable as this project is, we've all seen what happened yesterday. With The coup. Oh, yes.

There's no other word for it. Yeah. Given your rather sensitive situation, you were interested in joining the resistance. Serious question. Whether they yeah.

Serious question. Yeah. Possibly. Yes. Good.

Because I don't think this can be allowed to continue any further. And, you know, we're getting hangry. There there was a time when you couldn't be a civil servant now with the communist party, but I think That's right. They've they've relaxed those things a little bit. Well, I'm not asking you to join anything.

You know me. I'm not one of life's great joiners. So I might just sort of consider things. Yeah. I mean, you're you're probably gonna get heads up on stuff long before us normal folks.

You know? Yeah. Well, what what all I see really is, a lot of panic and and planning, that isn't leading to much. You know? They they talk they talk in government about billions of pounds being spent on, no deal planning.

Yeah. I'm not sure where that's really going. There's not there's not much practical planning. There's a lot of there's a lot of contractors being paid double the amount of civil servants to, to have ten year visions, but I'm sure I should be that one. Yeah.

Much, there's a much real planning for real emergency stuff. Not emergency, which which is why I got out of it, really, and came back to my day job. Right. You've escaped from the Brexit planning department. Yeah.

Yeah. Good plan. Yeah. I don't know. Just don't wanna be tainted with that.

Just with Defra for a while. Yeah. And and and I got so depressed with, you know, the the son of son of, common agricultural policy. Didn't take long to think that I ought to just get back. And and just going home every day and then seeing it on the news Yeah.

You know, it was just there was just people were just relentless, and there was no escape from it. No. It's depressing enough coming home and having to watch the news without having to sort of live live it a bit. Yeah. I mean, my giving up telly hasn't helped me in any way to have any more time, nor have I managed to save any money yet.

So I've yet to phone them up and tell them to fuck off and die because I hate talking to people on the phone, especially in call centers. But I saw, I saw, an article of a a fellow who, had give had had no TV for thirty years and was still being bothered annually by the TV licensing fee. Oh, yeah. They're happens all the time. Yeah.

And and no acceptance that there are people that don't watch TV and and No. They really they really won't have it. Of course, the thing is now you need a TV license anyway even if you're gonna watch it on your computer. Yeah. Since everyone's got a computer or even a phone where they can watch telly, I can understand that attitude now.

Yeah. Well, this this guy, that I was reading about is properly analog. You know? Yeah. Good man.

Yeah. No. It it hasn't benefited me in any particular way except that, I don't shout, you fascist Cal Rayworth quite so much as I used to. God, I hated that woman. I mean, you know, fifteen years ago, I had her down as the fucking little mother of the Soviet Union, fucking Nazi spokesperson, blonde.

Well, it's like these people who represent for Trump, isn't it? They're all blonde and have, like, these desperate cheekbones that look like they died about twenty years ago. I'm not having it. Yeah. It's like the aforementioned, sort of consultants and contractors.

They're sort of rife in public service these days. And Yeah. They they wear the uniform, the open neck shirt, the, you know, the smart suit, the bacon expression. I'm Steve Hilton. I am.

I'm Dominic Cummings. You're all going to hell in a handcart. Yeah. Something's gotta be done. Something's gotta be done.

And I'm concerned that if people take to the streets and riot, that's exactly what Boris Boris and Priti Patel want. It seems to me that we've arrived in a sort of John Woo situation where everyone is holding a gun to everybody else's head simultaneously, and everyone is waiting for the other lot to fuck up. You know? It's like everybody wants somebody else to make the first move so they can say, ah, you screwed up, and it will kick off kick off. And, you know, Corbyn with his, oh, I'm mister enigmatic and mysterious.

Actually, I haven't got a clue what's going on. You know, Boris just waiting for someone to give him the opportunity to bring back the fucking death penalty. You know? We we were talking about or we touched on Heath, Heathcote, last week and his, sacred elephant. And, I was reading about I was reading about With you?

Heathcote Williams, in the last week Mhmm. And how he wrote, I think, before he died I didn't realize he was dead, actually, until I looked at it. Died in early '17. But he, just before he died, wrote or had republished a book about Johnson called Profane Elephant. What was it?

What was it now? Something from from mare to nightmare, I think it was called. Very nice. So it was it was it was about his attitude to Brexit. Yeah.

And it was quite prophetic, I think, in some ways. It's interesting for Heath Cook Williams, isn't he? Because I you know, in a way, it's quite easy to dismiss him as, like, daft hippie or something. Yeah. But on the other hand, he does, on the whole system.

Stuff and and, you know, so he was quite sort of ahead of his time, really, in a long way. Yeah. I think you're right. I think you're right. And it was his boy that Dave Gilmore adopted who ended up, like, piddling on statues or something.

Yeah. He was draping flags over the cenotaph, ended up in in Wandsworth or wherever. And, I sort of disowned Hetker, I read, until the end of his life. So I went to see him as he was dying thing. Right.

And there's some reconciliation, I think. Uh-huh. But, yeah, quite interesting characters. I must sort of try and look up his book on Johnson. I I'm trying to get a good habit.

Yeah. Trying to get into the habit of not calling him Boris Yes. Because because it's, Makes him seem too cuddly, does he not? Yeah. It does.

And and and I and I think he's engineered that a bit. You know? I think, he's encouraged that. Oh, yeah. Cuddly, friendly.

Mhmm. And and there's something It's branding, isn't it? More sinister than that going on here. That's something much No no one no one calls him Johnson. No.

I see a lot of people calling him Bozo these days. Yeah. Bozo. BoJo, they they say, don't they? I've seen that as well.

Yeah. He is. And he's again, that's that's too much, you know, it's JLo, isn't it? It's like just desperate little creeps who wish they were American. This country would be a lot you know, for all that there's all these people stomping around saying they're patriots and calling the likes of me and trying to defend the fucking country as traitors.

Mhmm. You know, I mean, I'd I'd I'd I love the idea that the queen might have told Boris to piss off yesterday. And, then all the gammon's would have been on her doorstep calling her a traitor. Yeah. And all that.

Actually, in connection with She couldn't do anything but what she did. No. In connection with her and Heathcoat, I was also the last thing I was reading was about, was there a West Indian called Michael X or something? Oh, now then. What was it?

This this will be an interesting thing for the, for the tome, actually. My massive schoolboy error. You familiar with the little collage on the inside of, distressed general phone? Yes. Yep.

I put that together in the local library. I gave him some spiel about it for the student protect. It kinda came back to bite me a few months later when I walked into the record section there and found they'd got the album. But they let me do it. And, yeah, assembled all these guys, you know, like doomed doomed geniuses, George Mallory, Syd Barrett, Spike Milligan, all these guys who sort of, like who were chewed up and spat out by life.

And in there, I meant to put Malcolm X, no sellout. In an unguarded moment of library fatigue, I dropped in a photograph of Michael X, Rackman's fucking enforcer. So it's a case of spot the deliberate error, children. Yeah. Except it wasn't deliberate.

It was a genuine screw up. No one's ever called me on it. I've told one or two people, but I tend to keep it quiet because you don't really want to be putting monsters on your record sleep. No. But I think I I don't know whether it's the same Michael X.

I think it's the same guy who was he was hanged in '75. Yeah. And, Hesketh was dobbing graffiti on Buckingham Palace because he was objecting to the queen signing his death warrant Good point. A decade or two after the abolition of the Yeah. Because it was like The Bahamas or one of those tough places, wasn't it?

Yeah. Yeah. Where where they could still do that sort of thing? One of those, you know, shithole countries. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, the thing with Michael x is, like, I don't I don't believe in executing people. If murder is wrong, then don't commit another one. But he did kinda have it coming. He was a nasty man.

Yes. I've I've just read a little bit about him having a tendency to burn down buildings with people still in it. Yeah. And, like, there was sort of, like, machete enhanced housing advice. You know?

Yeah. Yeah. So I thought, last week was quite good, actually Yeah. On reflection. Oh, good.

But it was it was and it was quite a good choice wildlife because it's a reflective piece. Yeah. There's a lot of thinking back of mostly to '88, it appears. Yeah. It's very much '88 that one.

Yeah. Yeah. And and but I thought, and and and what I did since then was to to essentially transcribe. Didn't find at all, but actually, you know. Mhmm.

Doing it manually is probably a good thing because people have said that the machines won't get all the proper names anyway. So No. Nor will they necessarily understand what I'm saying. I mean, you know, real people quite often get me wrong. So machines, I don't think you've got any chance.

So, so I think I might just and, actually, what a lot of the transcribed stuff, I I could almost use, adorned or unchanged. So that's dead easy, really, for me. It turns me into a typist and and Oh, you did say you wanted to do the donkey work. And and it and it and that's what it may come down to. So it may just so I thought a bit of reordering at the end, and I'll be I'll get a shape of it as I do more.

Yeah. I think I might need to do about 15 to 20 of these to get it all done. Fine by me. And, but I want to try and do it a little more chronologically so I'm not getting mixed up. You know?

Yes. I guess if we do it chronologically, then the sort of it the sort of paths of history will reveal themselves rather than just diving in bit by bit and just oh, and that was when we and do you remember I said that we and yeah. So it saves me getting into a mess. And, there may be, as I said, I think last week, I don't I'm not gonna take it sort of track by track because that would be a bit painful. Mhmm.

But there might be a stage where we might need to do some sweeping up at the end or something. Because I think we'll cover a lot of things. We'll we'll cover things acts we'll we'll we'll come to songs accidentally as I think we were we were doing last week with the great Euphrates the great, Yes. After the great Euphrates. Yes.

For instance. It's a great conversation piece. Yeah. So, Martha Bacon. Righty o.

My my copy, I think, for some reason, had this flyer in the front of it. So I so I must have gone to some gig with, wooden tops. Mhmm. And I don't know when this was, but the flyer says, first London show since 1992. So whether that makes this something that happened in '96 2006 or 2016 is beyond me.

It's, 02/2006. You think? Yep. I know. Complete control.

That's Tony Fraser. Nice guy. And, yep, that was a 100 club open for him there. That wasn't actually oh, it's their first London show. Yeah.

They they did one the night before at the race horse with Wilson supporting them. Oh, yeah. And we destroyed Maybe I saw that and didn't maybe I saw that and didn't go to the London gig. Maybe. Yeah.

Yeah. They got their own back. They they they beat me at home, but we killed them up here. It was a hot night. And after we'd finished, the place just emptied and never refilled.

Yeah. And they just played to each other, basically. Yeah. Simon had that come in there. Yeah.

And I was on that one as well at the Luminaire. I think I did that one with Max. Yeah. So I sort of I I must have just slipped it in my copy of Bath of Bacon because I'm I realized there's a there's a connection and, and, color match. Oh, yeah.

That's rather tasteful. With Rolo and, Alice playing on the Bath of Bacon. So how how did that all happen, and what was the association with them from the start? Was this before the Woodentops formed or about the same time? Or I remember.

Well, now we started making bath in the '82. Yeah. And around about that time, I was spending I had the day job, and, they used to send me down to do company law windings up and so forth on Monday mornings at the Royal Courts of Justice. And this because, you know, to send a partner would just be insanely expensive, and all you've gotta do is sit there and watch them go down. You know?

So they used to send muggins here. So I would hit the expenses bucket on Friday night and take, like, a princely sum of, like, 15 or if I dared, £20. I'd then take a £2 bus to London on a Friday night and hang out with Roe. Rolo, that is. And, he was certainly, by 82, he was already demoing on his little four track at home.

He was demoing stuff that would end up in the wooden top set. They didn't really get going, I don't think, as a public thing till '83, but then nor did we. And, indeed, he was he was still playing with me in '83. I can remember we had a blazing argument once because he'd, he'd agreed to do a show with me, and then he got a wooden top show and only told me that he couldn't do ours with about thirty six hours notice. Right.

And, you know, in those days, I didn't quite have the pool of talent to draw upon that I do nowadays. You know, I couldn't phone up Eno's bass player and say, oh, could you, fill in, mate? But, yeah, things have improved that way. And and and Alice, were they I met Alice at Oxford, and we went out for a little while. She actually lived with me when we first moved to Northampton, but young girl from the Edinburgh, bourgeoisie, wanted to make it, write books and stuff, headed off to London after a while.

And because she was in London, she actually lived in the same road as Rolo. So he wanted a keyboard player who was kind of programmable. He did he he wanted someone who would just do what he wanted them to do on a Casio. And she didn't know enough about keyboards to resist, so she was his perfect choice. You know?

He could he could sort of, like, mold her into his own monster. Yeah. And I see she's had a, quite a career writing. Yeah. She's put a few few novels out.

I read the first one. She'd get a lot of flack for that if it came out today, I tell you. I was wondering about She's quite distasteful scenes. I was thinking about flack for, Chinatown if it came out in 2020. I actually had an argument with a Chinese chap about this.

Yeah. Do we I mean, I can't remember what the lyric was now about, having to be careful about the Chinese. I suppose maybe it's true that we Well, it was I I mean, we'll get to that. I should I should say first of all about Rolo. Yeah.

Go ahead. We met at school. Alright. And I was having some sort of afternoon jam with some like minded kids in the school hall, which was empty, and we'd set up a couple of amps and a drumkit. And we were having a little jam.

And we were making talk about full disclosure. We were making an attempt at covering Master of the Universe by Hawkwind. So we're sort of grinding along, essentially for that thing. Yeah. And the rest.

And, yeah, we were grinding along, you know, bumping along like little white boys who couldn't really play. And this little lad came in in his school uniform with a sort of what looked a bit like a beetle haircut. So almost like a a jet black helmet of hair. And he just stood watching while we ground on. And finally, we sort of got it out of our systems and stopped.

And this little guy, who was significantly younger than us and smaller than us, in his school uniform, as it finished, he just looked up and went, shouldn't it be, bit meaner than that? That was the first thing Rolo ever said to me. I read something about them being the shortest band, you'd ever come across or something like that. It's amazing how many bands are short. Quite early on in our career, we were supporting Alan Vega at the venue in Victoria.

And after our set, which was fairly ignominious, I was milling around at the bar when I clocked Susie and the Banshees Oh. Or three quarters of them. There was Sue and Severin and Bujak. Yeah. Tiny, tiny, tiny people.

Tiny people. David Bowie, tiny. Prince, tiny. Mick Jagger, tiny. Yeah.

I was never gonna make it in this game. Quite admire Susie being, you know, lost in France for the last twenty years. Oh, she's a dame. You've gotta respect Susie. She's great.

In fact, all of them Budgie's a brilliant, brilliant drummer. Severin's a clever bloke. Now I've got time for the banshees. John McGeach was brilliant. Loved him.

Don't mind fat Bob. But, yeah, it's amazing how many pop musicians are tiny. It really is. But at the time, you know, we didn't know so many people, so we only knew that the wooden top's really cool and, not tall at all. That was Owen's.

We must have a plan if we're to outweigh all those China men. Right. Well, the first thing that's gonna freak you out a little bit was that, originally, it wasn't about Chinese people at all. It was about the sausage people. Oh, yeah.

The reference to that. Yeah. Rolo and I, we were in those days in the early eighties, when I was hanging around with him a lot down in Clapham, We would take quite a lot of LSD, and I think the sausage people emerged from that. And, yeah, the the demo of that, it is we must have a plan if we're talking about all the sausage people. But then something happens.

On the television, I think the BBC, they started transmitting a program called the Chinese detective. Yeah. I see you. Watch me shift the blame here. And, unbelievably Nicky Jip or someone I seem to remember.

What was the name of the actor? Yeah. Can't remember the actor's name, but I do remember the name of the character for it was detective sergeant Ho. Fortunately, like, the hip hop thing hadn't quite kicked in over here at that point. But, yeah, I just became enhanced by the concept of, so detective sergeant Ho.

And, we had the baseline, and we got the, you know, the the line? It's a it's a glockenspiel. Oh, yeah. And, you know, we had the shape of it and the chords of it and everything. And it sort of suggested all that tinkly stuff that you hear.

What what failed to convince my Chinese mate about this, but what is genuinely God's honest truth, is that I wasn't trying to take the piss out of Chinese people at all. I was trying to take the piss out of the way that privileged white people in television companies and film companies portrayed these things. Hence, in the music, the the glockenspiel are going like, The whole thing was a kind of two level piss take, if you if you see what I mean. And, yeah, I remember my auntie Primrose being a little bit concerned about this. He's like, oh, absolutely sure about this.

It was Chinese thing. I said, I'm not having a go at the Chinese. I'm having a go at the people who made the Chinese detective. Yes. You see what I mean?

Yeah. It was supposed to. A lot of the stuff on Bath of Bacon is operating just too far ahead of itself for its own good, basically. It is trying to ridicule the medium by operating within the medium. You know, at this point, I had no idea that I would ever make another record again and, quite reasonably, I think.

And I had this thing. I mean, you know, calling it calling the character the jazz butcher, I never really thought that anyone had clocked that it was actually a real person, that it would be me. Yeah. I like the idea of sort of sniping from the margins was the phrase I've been using all this time. Mhmm.

And so a lot of it was, like, having a go at pop music for being a bit stupid and having a go at the entertainment industry for being a bit stupid and a bit racist. I mean, I did a tune which never got released for obvious reasons called Belgian Congo, which was like a ridiculous kind of King Kong jungle theme from some imaginary idiot King Kong movie. All pounding bongos and, funny little sort of eastern melodies. And, the lyric, down in the place where the Brits don't go, everybody do the Belgian Congo. Tell you what, that melody got recycled.

That melody turns up on Line of Death on Big Planet, Scary Planet. That one. But that they are. That was originally the Belgian Congo melody. And, just jumping about a bit.

Yes. Christmas with the Pygmies and so on. There's another sort of another, sort of take on Yes. Again, you could you could just think that that's pure Tommy Robinson shit, but it's not. My favorite line line on that I mean, it was just it was just a bit of stupidity, like, the devil is my friend.

You know? And these the thing is people seem to like stupidity. It comes back to haunt you. And you gotta bear in mind with Swinging With the Pygmies that we gave it away for nothing. We attached no value to this recording.

You see what I'm saying? But my favorite bit on it is just as it's fading out, you know, everyone's going swinging with the pygmies. And, right on the fader, you can just hear me going intellectual pygmies, which I thought was kind of funny, but that's just me, really. I got in trouble because I was want I was doing metal banging, and they said, no. No.

You've done enough metal banging. Get on with the next track. I was, I don't wanna bang me metal. They were like, no. Bring yourself in, fishy.

I was I'm just going back to the sausage people. They're just sort of Yes. Mentioned in the in the Yeah. They get they And they're they're sort of dotted about the record, aren't they? And there are some Yeah.

They get a credit as backing vocalists on something, I think. Yes. Yeah. Poisoned by food. And and the, Where else?

And, we'll come back to that as well. But the but there are some names dropped in Sex Engine called Claude Beatty. Yeah. As Max Weil, X Benedict, Momental. Yeah.

These were all from the sort of bucket of aliases, pseudonyms, and smokescreens that we were considering deploying around that time. Tammy Vermicelli and her jumping no. Tammy Ravioli and her jumping Vermicelli. Things like that. We just used to like making up daft names for groups.

Like, for example. You know? So yeah. Yeah. The sausage people, they they were a thing at the time.

And Lionel Brando? Oh, now Lionel Brando. That's the big one, isn't it? Who is Lionel Brando? Yeah.

I shall we reveal that in the tome, do you think? I suppose we should. It was the alias of none other than d Elvis Barker himself. Yeah. I've wondered.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did wonder. So he's sort of credited as, co producer, isn't he?

Yes. I mean, yeah, we'd have been a bit sunk without him. And none of us knew anything about making records at all. I mean, I arrived with a nylon string guitar that had no pickup or anything like that. Walked up the stairs with it, got to the top, and Martin Daly, the engineer, just handed me an acoustic 12 string and said, play that.

And I'd never even seen a 12 string before, never mind played one. But there I was straight in Girls Who Keep Goldfish on the 12 string. So, you know, you live and learn on the job. And so thinking about the the name, the jazz butcher, and how that came about and and whether you were at one p I get the feeling that at one period, you were sort of a bit embarrassed by it and particularly, you know, avoidance of the Jazz Butcher theme in at life. Well, why would you play that for thirty years, I guess?

But I know that in recent years, you've you've dug it out occasionally. I like playing that tune. Yeah. I had to, when we did the hundred club, in the spring maybe. No.

'18. The '18. The big one with where it was freezing cold, and we still managed to fill the under club with Tim Keegan supporting. Mhmm. And, yeah, I had to coax and cajole the band into allowing me to use it as a little intro just for the first few just the first sort of, like, perhaps a third of it just to introduce the set.

And they were they were all a bit sort of sweaty eyed about it. They're all, really? Why why have we gotta do this? It's the intro. It's like an intro.

The fans all know what it is. Because the great thing about the quartet and the quintet was that none of the guys in it really knew anything about the history of the Jazz Butcher, which was rather lovely. It was kinda liberating. And I didn't you know, if I taught them a song, I didn't play them the record. I thought, well, I'll just see how they respond to it.

Yeah. So there wasn't there wasn't a period when you were sort of, like, dismissive or disowning. Oh, yeah. I'd I tried to shed it, when we moved from glass to creation. And Yeah.

Like, before we did anything public at creation, we'd already got Fishcotheque in the can. And, actually, there was a lot of nomenclature dispute about this because I said to Alan at the time, Alan McGee, I said, you know, this jazz butcher thing. Right? There's people out there think we're a comedy band. Is there is this a chance for us to change it?

No. No, Pat. That's the one they all know. You've got to keep it. And then brand, like it or not.

Yeah. Exactly. And that's when I sort of realized I was stuck with it. But it got more complicated than that because we actually wanted to call Fishcotheque. We wanted to call the album Michael Jackson.

Yes. And Alan said, no. His lawyers won't like it. So that and me and Kizzy were there in this in the office. And we kinda looked at each other, and we looked at Alan, and then we went, well, can we call it Kate Bush then?

And then he saw the photo outside the Fiscotheque, and he went, that's it. That's the one they're going to want. And so that's what they got. You ever been back to that chippy? You know, it's a disgrace that I haven't.

They probably still have the album or a picture or something inside. There are photos of me and Kizzy on the menus. I I shit you not. There are records framed hanging on the wall. They've really gone for it.

At the time, it was run by this old fella. And, I remember Ed Ball took the record in to show him, and he became angry. He became indignant. He said, what's you doing? What's you doing putting this on?

And Edward, being such a positive and agreeable personality, finally talked him around to the idea that people all over the world would be seeing his chip shop and that maybe it would be good for business. Yeah. So he mellowed and stopped his objections, and everything went ahead. But then many, many years later, sometime this century, I got a a message from the Fiscotheque. A a new generation had taken over.

Yeah. Young guys. And they were really, really into it. And I was invited to the grand reopening, which for a number of reasons, I couldn't make. It was it was a real shame.

I'll tell you why. It's because the trains had all gone to ship because it was Easter Sunday. And that's what happens when you let Muslims open a restaurant. They had the grand opening on Easter Sunday, bless them. So I literally couldn't be there.

Physically could not be there. But, yeah, a a few mates have visited since, and they've sent back photographs, and it's ridiculous. I can show you. I've got them on my computer. It's ridiculous.

It's it's really sweet. And people do. I mean, I've got again, I I have actual photographs of actual large American men in suits leaning on those railings recreating the cover. Going back to Bacon. Yes.

And and well, actually, I'd like to explore a little more, playing heavy metal in at school, but maybe another time. We'll come back to that. I well, I mean, we could write a book called Why Hawkwind is Not Heavy Metal. Why Hawkwind are not hippies sounds even more outrageous, but I would argue that they were sort of proto punks. Yeah.

Like the Pink Fairies and Nick Farrow and the Deviants. That whole Labyrinth Grove scene, I mean, the the attitude was punk. Sure. They look like hippies because that's what was on sale in the one stop hippie shop. You know?

But, in reality, they were pretty hostile, anarchist nutcases. My kind of people. Partytime. Which is like a favorite, isn't it? That that's perennial.

The thing is, even when the audience lets you get away with not playing it, the lead guitar player won't. All the guitar players want to go on that. You know? Old Joe Woolley, he's the right case in point. He loves playing that.

And after a few years of flirting with it, he's pretty much got the Ida solo down. He's got all the widdly widdly widdly widdly widdly you know, it goes to the triplets. He's he's worked and worked and worked until he can reproduce that. Bless him. Yeah.

And I he, you know, he gave it a good stab at the cash for cancer night, but he was a little bit stymied by having a very drunken Mick playing the drums. I say playing the drums, interfering with the drums. Tim. That's quite, quite an advanced solo, isn't it? Was Max was was he always did he did he arrive brilliant, or did he did he did he He was a very sure.

He no. He was very interesting case. Before Jazz Butcher, we played in this band called Sonic Tonix. Oh, yes. Which was run by a very clever, very angry young man called John Silver, who has since made a small pile and done very nicely.

I think I'm right in saying that John produced that television program, Grand Designs. Alright. I think he's responsible for that old pitfall. I I think the show should be renamed tax audit, but that's just me. And in the time that he was playing in the Tonics, Peter, Max, who had started out as a very earnest, long haired vegan hippie, When I first saw him playing in a in a band before that, he was he he he actually, the band actually played Freebird, and he got to do the interminable guitar solo.

And that's when I first noticed him because we were doing a gig in Cambridge, and his band was supporting the Sonic Tonics. And he played an absolute blinder of a guitar solo on Freebird, of all things. And, the problem with that gig in Cambridge, we all suffered from it, was that we were used to drinking in Oxford where the ales were generally quite mild. And we got over to Cambridge, and we were all drinking, Abbott, which is almost twice as strong as what we were used to. So everyone basically was blind drunk, including Max when he played the solo on Freebird.

But I guess it was only because he was drunk that I thought that he did so well. You know? And, yeah, he did that. And then he came into the Sonic Tonics, and that was a much more sort of new wave sort of post punk sort of thing. John was he he liked Wire and Gang of Four and and and Syd Barrett and all that.

And like like all of us, he was of a generation where he had formed pre punk. But, he very much embraced it, and he was very good at writing these kind of spiky, paranoid sort of songs. He he had things like, the man who ate himself to death, for example. And Domestic Animal, that was one of John's. I only get a writing credit on that because I could only remember half of it, so I had to make the other half up.

And Sonic Tonics released at at least a single? Two. And I don't think I've heard either. I've got them somewhere. You can have a borrow of them if you want.

They're not very good. The one the first one without me on it is better than the second one with me on it. The second one, we got a bit confused. But Max came into that, and, you know, it's like he and I have been in a band before that called The Institution, which had Rolo in it. It's your crucial three, if you like.

Yeah. And the institution was a kind of I don't know. It was a bit pretentious. It was a bit like sort of magazine or something like that. Whereas the tonics was, as I say, it was a much more sort of straight head spiky.

So Max had got some experience of playing in the sort of new rave fashion, but he wasn't that convincing at it. And then the tonics kind of made him better at it, and he, you know, he was starting to listen now to things like the slits and the specials and, the gang of four. So he was he was getting with the program. And then the tonics split up in November '80. I I this is difficult for me.

I'm not very good at the turn of decades for some reason. No. It would be November, the last tonics gigs. And for a month or so, I didn't see much Peter, for he was Peter back then. And then my mate, a very influential man whom we're gonna have to traverse quite a lot, my mate, the Antichrist, decided he was going to throw a rather ambitious cabaret evening.

He was gonna take over the bar at Merton College. He was gonna replace the genial old geyser behind the bar with, waiters in white coats with trays. He's gonna run the whole thing like a posh cabaret and put on various alleged talents. And the interesting thing about it was the the things people that you were putting on were, like, pretty much imaginary, just pretty much notional acts. And I'd started sort of trying to think what was gonna happen to me after the Sonic Tonics.

And I got into this reductionist walking away, Syd Barrett kind of attitude. You know, I'm I was 23, and I wanted to be Syd Barrett already. I mean, to be fair, he got there even younger, didn't he? And so I turned up to do my bit at Antis Cabaret. And looking for backup, I got ahold of Peter, and I said, listen.

Do you wanna come and play guitar? It's all it's all just two, three chord songs. It's piece of piss. And he he said, yeah. I'll I'll come and do it.

And he came and he backed me. He also backed Anti when Anti did his few songs. And it was extraordinary. Suddenly, there was Max Eider. Suddenly, there was this kind of country soul style that he's got with a little bit of sort of West Montgomery jazz sort of inflection to it.

Obviously, nothing like as fully formed as it is these days, but it was there. You know, three or four weeks after he'd been sort of going on his Yamaha, suddenly, he'd got this fluid style that had emerged almost, like, fully formed overnight. And and he was singing a song called The Intro and the Outre, because that's the kind of songwriter he is. And Peter was backing him up. And after he'd sung a couple of verses, Anti went to introduce the instrumental passage, and he just went, take it, Max.

That was the moment. That was the exact moment. It was the night John Lennon died. It was something like the 12/08/1981. And while poor old John Lennon was getting blown to bits, we were accidentally reinventing ourselves.

Me as a sort of three chord idiot songwriter and Max as the guitar player that he became. Cabaret Somneuf, we called it. And somehow, we got away with it too, and we had the waiters. Yeah. Waiters and that.

So, yeah, that was Max, and it was extraordinary, the the transition of the guitar style. And, obviously, I mean, if you look at party time, if you look at the different versions that have been recorded over the years, you can hear the solo maturing. But even so, right from the word go, he had that. Yeah. And is the song just about, going to parties and drinking for nothing?

Brian Ferry. Not much of a role model. Loneliness is a crowded room full of faces that turn to stone all together, all alone. That's what it's about, isn't it? It's about being stuck in a room with a bunch of people you don't know who are talking about stuff that doesn't interest you.

And, I think I'll have another of those. And and then And then you get drunk and you see the girl on the other side of the room, and you think, well, she might take me home. And, of course, she doesn't. And then you disgrace yourself, and you go home in an ambulance or something. It's just it's documentary, and it it fell out.

Again, anti. I was around the Antichrist's room at Merton College for he was a student there. I'd left, but he was he was still there. And I was looking for drugs, basically. And I went around to Anti.

He didn't have any drugs, but he knew a man who did. He said, look. You stop here, fishy, and, I'll go piling out and see if I can't get some bit of smoke. And he went off, and I was left alone in his room. And he was gone an unfeasibly long time.

And I remember listening to Dare by the Human League, which had just come out. I'm thinking, blimey. That's different. And then I remember getting really bored, and I remember actually trying to sniff some glue. And then still, Anti had not returned.

And out of total boredom, I picked up his acoustic guitar, and I couldn't really play guitar. But I just heard a record, and I don't know who performs it, but a record called The Rich Get Rich. I'd heard it on John Peel. And it was all this major seventh stuff. You know?

And I thought, well I mean, I didn't know they were major seventh at the time, but I knew that it was like c with some bits left off. So I bashed at the c, and then I found the f. And, of course, like all idiots with guitars, it was good. And then I just whacked it out. By the time Anti finally turned up with the hash, the song was written pretty much as you'd hear it today.

It came really, really quick, and it was only the second time I tried to write a song. The first song I ever wrote was with, a little wasp synthesizer that I borrowed, and that turned out into South America. But, yeah, party time was, like, the first thing I'd sort of, you know, sat down with guitar in my lap like a songwriter and come out with it. And it pretty much just fell out. And sometimes when I have to sing the lyric a hundred years later, it kind of feels like that.

And the and the including the famous line, cold bath with someone you dislike, which is still like the tag line for the for the website. Yeah. Dave obviously likes that one. That line is interchangeable. You know, Lou Reed always used to, like, mess around and change the lines to songs.

And over the years, that's had a few substitutions. Better than a cold bath with police chief Daryl Gates came up back in the sort of early nineties when he was going around whacking black men in the head. And a cold bath with the person we must call Johnson. I haven't really I don't think I'd even dignify the fat maggot with putting him in a song. But, Yeah.

That that used to go down quite well on the West Coast, the old police chief tailgate. So better than a cold bath with Godzilla and his mates. That's another one. There's been a few over the years, but I don't know. Better than a cold bath with someone you dislike.

I mean, it's not that good, is it? And, I was gonna talk a little bit about, the various animals on the Right. On the record like Bigfoot and kittens and goldfish. Tell us about Bigfoot first. Well The Bigfoot was written at work when I should have been doing lawyering, and I I sat in a little cupboard office by myself and spent most of the time talking to Dave Barker on the phone.

He used to phone me up because I had no phone at my flat. So he used to phone me up at work and, like, sit there chuntering on for, like, an hour and a half. And, Dave had just been to America for some reason. And while he was out there, he'd seen a Saturday night live parody of the adverts for the Roach Motel. You know the Roach Motel?

No. This was a product you could get in the eighties in America, maybe still can. Oh, yeah. And it's sort of shoebox sized. Yeah.

And it's called Roach Motel. And the roaches go in, and they get gassed or poisoned or something. They check-in as well. Well, that's exactly it. Their slogan was they check in, but they don't check out.

And Dave was very impressed with this. And, I think what he'd then seen was Saturday Night Live did a parody of this advert. Only instead of Roach Motel, it was Bigfoot Motel. And Dave was telling me about this, and I I hung up. And it was 1982, so, like, I've got sort of Burundi thing going on on the desks.

Kinda heavy Bigfoot noise, like a Bigfoot motel. So that pretty much wrote itself instantaneously. You haven't been to the West Coast by then? No. No.

I didn't get to go to America until we toured there in '86. Most places, I only seen for the first time because I was sent there for money. I've been to Paris before, and I've been to Rome as a small boy, but I didn't really count. I quite like the idea of, you know, them them being used for meat. Well, it is kinda comical, and it it would explain why, you know, it's it's like no one really knows the facts.

It's like, you know, oh, it's a government cover up. It's no. No. No. No.

It's not a government cover up. It's a corporate cover up because do you ever wonder how they make hot dogs? Mhmm. You see, I I I painted myself into a corner anyway because, alright, we've got this Bigfoot motel. We're trapping Bigfoots.

What for? And, you know, you gotta remember Jazz Butcher. I mean, I, in those days, I was still guzzling dead animals. So, like, it was all quite funny to me. But, again, it's that sort of meta meta thing.

You know, you're writing a song that's parodying a parody of an advert. And, in a world where people are sort of, like, nodding their heads to Paul Weller's latest opinions about the state of the world, you can't necessarily expect pop fans to, give it the kind of attention to sort of dig through to what you're actually saying. And there's there's another parody of an ad in Poisones by Food, which I think you've used a couple of times, the prized turkeys delight thing. Ah, yeah. Well, prized turkeys delight, of course, on chick on, the best way.

Yeah. But, that was I mean, you gotta bear in mind this record here, I can't sing. I have not learned to sing. And quite what all that bellowing is about, I really don't know. It took I don't think I should really start singing properly until Sex and Travel, the third album.

Mhmm. But I think that's partly a confidence thing. I quite like the well, like in a lot of early works of any anyone's, you know, the roughness and the, incompetence, if you like, for one. Oh, there's a charm to that. Yeah.

Yeah. There's a charm to that. When Things that wouldn't make a later record. Things that you would scrub, you would you you Yes. You just don't know any better.

Yeah. Yeah. Be quite happy with. And I mean, we've to be fair, we've always sort of held with that. We just don't know any better.

People, you know, people say to me, like, oh god. Are there are there unreleased things? The answer is, well, no. We have no quality control. If we if we record it successfully, then we put it out.

You know? Yeah. And there are and there are lots of not lots of mistakes, but there are, you know, rough rough bits. And the odd even even in later records, there's the odd jarring moment that you just decide you want second take. Yeah.

I mean, sometimes, there's a there's a moment before the second take, maybe. I don't know. No. No. No.

We've never been short of time. But there's a moment on Ghosts on Waiting for the Love Bus where Crouchy takes his guitar solo in the middle. And he he went searing off first take. He he was nailing it. And, when it was done, Richard and I, Rich Formby and I, we're like, yeah, mate.

Come in. And we brought him in, and he sat down, and we listened to it. And there was a moment right in the middle of the sort of chorus part of the solo where it hits the big old g d e minus c radio chord sequence. And none of us had noticed it during the take. All three of us noticed it as soon as we listened back.

There's just a moment where Crouch is, like, sailing like a big ship magnificent. And then he just goes, like, and bends his way out of it. And the first time we heard it, we all looked at each other. Oh, fuck. And we're about to send him back in, and Richard went, no.

No. Listen one more time. And we listened one more time. And then we listened a third time. And we went, yeah.

Keep it. And you and you get to like it. Yeah. It's it's I I I love it, actually. I wait for it now.

When I'm listening to that record, I wait for Crouchie's note. You know? Because it is it's actually perfect. And we were actually, we were using oblique strategies during the making of Love Bus because a lot of it was, it was it wasn't a record that was like everything was written before. It was, quite I wouldn't say it's not improvised except for President Chang.

That is literally a jam. But a lot of it was kinda cooked up on the fly. Follow your nose kind of thing in the studio. And we were using oblique strategies to help with this. And, of course, one of those, which we didn't pull the card out at the time, but it's it was in all our heads, I think.

Correction. It was in Richard's head, and it was in my head. What was in Crouch's head, we'll never know. He's probably thinking about beer. And, yeah, of course, one of the big famous oblique strategies is honor your mistake as a hidden intention.

Mhmm. And we did. Another outbreak of oblique strategies on that one where we did use the cards was, that song Kaliningrad. Alright. And I'd got a verse.

See the bears see the bears from the air, that's the Soviet air force, pour the fat boy under the table. And I needed something that was gonna end up with awe. Nobody knows who they work for anymore. So I needed a run that ended with awe, but I could not I like the bears from the air, pulling the fat boy under the table. I was digging that, but I didn't know what to do next.

And, you know, I think it was just me and Rich there. And, you know, Rich is an incredibly patient bloke, but it was getting to a sort of sort of moment. And, I said to him, Rich, I'm getting nowhere, mate. Pass us the old oblique strategies to see if that helps. And I pulled the card out, and it said, commit a sudden violent action.

So immediately and without thinking, I just went through the whole box of cards up in the air. Oh, here we go. Spinning his drink and throwing all of his cards on the floor. They really work. And then the love kittens and the dark message behind the love kittens.

Yes. Yes. You're onto this, aren't you? You know about this. I wrote that in the dying days of the Sonic Tonics.

And I was very sad because in our own curious way, we we had a personality as a band, and we had good songs. And when we were good at that point, we were really quite something. And, you know, the so called psychedelic revival is just around the corner, and it all looked kinda good, but we collapsed under the weight of our own sort of aspirations, I suppose. And I was kinda sad about that, and I got into this walking away frame of mind. And I think I said the other day that we'd had this little office where Max and Owen lived where we used to sort of glue our slick record sleeves together and phone up people and harass them.

And I found myself through there alone one afternoon. And, again, just picked up a guitar, started doing that major seventh thing. And it just it just came all of a rush, really. You know, a bloke who has become so disenchanted and disappointed with everything that he's pinning it all on kittens. You know, a lot of the stuff that people perceived is like comedy and the rest of it.

It was like, well, don't think you're appreciating how much sort of thought and organization has gone into this. Because, actually, that's that's not what we're talking about. You know? I mean, it is funny. Yeah.

Penguins, you can laugh if you want. But And and look, Barrett's Barrett's the same. I mean, Barrett's exactly the same. He'll do things that appear to be completely humorous. You know?

And there are moments where teenage boys are smoking hash, listen to the second side of the madcap laughs, and the scum Waters and Gilmore leave the studio chat in between, and it say, oh, it sounds like Syd's having a nervous breakdown. I can tell you from personal experience that everybody sounds like that when they're trying to talk to a control room and the guy keeps not turning on the microphone or are you, what? Are you are you are you there? Are we no. It's just everybody does that.

That's not Syd Barrett going mental, and they fucking knew it as well. There's a I mean, there's a certain conspiracy theory that buzzes around among Syd Barrett nuts that Waters, especially Anne Gilmore, sabotaged the making of Madcap Laughs. The title instantly was theirs, not his. Deliberately sabotaged it because they were scared that their newly song free and directionless, Pink Floyd, was gonna be eclipsed by the guy who'd written all the hits making a solo record. And, yeah, the myth of mad Syd and the rest of it.

No. I'm sorry. Everybody talks like that in between in between takes because studios are annoying places, and the headphone mix is never right. You know? So Kittens is really just about finding comfort from domestic animals when all else fails Yeah.

In other when all is lost. Yeah. In other words, yeah, it's about walking away from the human race and just taking comfort. It's it's like those dreadful things that you hear about, oh, I just want a baby because I want unconditional love. You know, that is such a Well, it becomes conditional with with the real people, I think you'll find after a while.

You know? Oh, absolutely. Whereas whereas it doesn't animals. I I I it reminds me of, when my mother was in a nursing home Yeah. And one of her, one of her fellow inmates was was deriving comfort from a stuffed cat, which which she which she had stroked to the stuffing, you know, repeatedly.

Yeah. It's it's it it's desperately, desperately sad that it has come to this, you know, that they are so starved of any kind of meaningful human interaction that lay solace in things like that. I myself had when I was at college in my room, I had a little rubber little squeaky rubber kitten about this big, which I'd had since I was a tiny little kid. And it was the the rubber was all dried out, and the squeak had gone. And it was nonetheless, the thing that was remarkable about it was that it was it was kind of textured, and it was actually quite a realistic rubber kitten.

And I used to keep that. And in the absence of having any pussycat, I I I would fuss it. And then in my finals at university, there was a question in the moral philosophy exam, which I was dreading because I have no morals, and I know no philosophy. I I was looking through the many, many questions from which you had to choose, and one of them was a very simple question. It just said, does your cat have rights?

And I said, well, of course not. It's made out of fucking rubber. But, yeah, I mean, I sometimes think about when we used to tour Germany a lot, we used to stop we always had stayed in the same place in Frankfurt. And there was a news agency there, and I used to go in, and they had what I call kitty porn. That is to say, beautiful glossy magazines for about four marks that were just full of pictures of cats, centerfolds.

You know? I used I used to buy one or two of these for sort of humorous thing to read on the bus. But they weren't humorous. They were heartbreaking because I'm thinking, well, who buys who buys these? Well, who buys porn?

Blokes who can't get laid. So who's buying this? Oh god. It's old ladies who live in flats when they're not allowed pets. So I find this just unspeakably sad.

I feel the weight of the universe descending and crushing my heart as we speak just thinking about this. So the Kitten's song, you know, you've called it already. You know what it's about. Comfort. Comfort.

It's not even comfort. It's just that it's just trying to draw a picture of someone in that state who is just so desperate for comfort. Yeah. Yeah. Girls Who keep goldfish.

I saw a marvelous television program. Sometimes I do know your enemy television. And so I watched a documentary about Genesis. And Tony Banks was interviewed, the keyboard player, about their early records. And it was like, well, why do you write songs about giant hogweeds and invasions from your outer space and all this pretentious prog rock stuff?

Why do you write these words? And he said, well, you see, the thing is we we didn't really know any girls, so just write about what you know. And in a way, I suppose Girls Who Keep Goldfish is a little bit like Tony's remark. It's like, oh, I don't really get girls. I mean, they're they're interesting in that, but well, those fish are alright.

You know, it's it's it's not that far away from Love Kittens, actually. It's not that far away. It's there's an awful lot of it on the early records, and it is because a lot of that stuff was written at a time, and I'd walked away from a band that I liked that turned out not to be going anywhere. And I moved to a town that I didn't know, and I didn't know anybody. Moved to London, sis, or where you No.

Up up here. Meeting here. Yeah. When I finally gave up on Oxford as a town I mean, I'd done done with the university a couple of years before. It took me about two years to realize it wasn't just the university that was up its own ass.

It was everyone in the city. You know? It was the buskers. It was the blokes who pumped your gas. It was the bar ladies.

It was everyone was up themselves. Coming here was like a liberation. But, initially, I had no money, no job. I was staying at my mom and dad's house. I had nowhere to go, no one to talk to.

And that's when I started writing a lot of these songs. So there is a lot of isolation and sort of rejection and all that sort of thing. There's there's a lot of it underneath this. Great great fun and let's, sort of I I imagine it to be like, you know, being depressed and disenchanted with a day job and all of that. Is there an element to that in it, or am I reading too much?

The thing about gray flannelette was I mean, it's obvious where the idea comes from. And it was anti. Again, it was and I can remember. Because I used to wear this gray suit of kind of not tweedy, but an actual sort of fabric rather than, like, you know, a smart smart suit like that. This was a bit more sort of wooly or whatever.

I I love that suit, but it got pretty knackered because I wore it a lot. And, I remember Antje just looking up at me one day and just going, gray flannelette. And the verses to that came very fast. It was almost like automatic writing. Oh, and I've done my editing anyway with a bloody glockenspiel riff.

It, you know, it was it it felt like Tubular Bells and The Exorcist, but, you know, I've got my headphones on. It's like a January afternoon. It's freezing cold. I can't take the chance of rolling a joint in case my mother comes in and has a fit. So I'm, like, taking lumps of dough, putting them on a pin under a wine glass, just filling it up with smoke and just going.

So, like, getting about three joints worth of dope in one in one hit. So I'm off my cake. I'm in the headphones. It's going. And on the demo, you know, it's not very tight.

There's two or three of them, and they're all just sprinkling and spankling around. And you don't please don't use that expression when you write it out. They're all just clattering around. And, yeah, the words just, like, completely just tumbled out really. And when I look back, there's one verse that I really like.

I'm in the zoo. I'm looking at the animals thinking about sculpture made out of steak. Yeah. Of course, that's exactly what they are. I didn't think about it at the time.

It just kinda tumbling out, but that's what animals are, isn't it? The sculpture made out of steak. So that was a lucky one. Yeah. That wasn't really that was more more just sort of daftness.

And also, I did like the music, so I kinda kept it. But then there's the business with that. Right. And, of course, at the end money. Yeah.

Exactly. And that that just you know, you you get the music down first, and we'd got enough of the music we knew that that would that would do. So, like, instead of just doing my to signal I was done with it, so I was just starting to go. And then, of course, when I'm doing the vocal, I'm hearing that, and I'm going, think I'll saw my leg off. We were not no.

I can't say that we weren't into drugs because we were, but we didn't really do a lot of smoking or drug taking in the studio. But we did do a lot of drinking. So, again, that explains a lot of the sort of daft bellowing. Sex engine. You hear a voice go, take it out of here.

I don't want it. And what that is is in the middle of the vocal take, someone's coming and offered me an entire bottle of wine. Take it out of here. I don't want it. We almost covered everything apart from, the French song and, the necromancy.

The French song, I thought of earlier. You were talking about the sort of naivety and borderline incompetence of a lot of the performance on that. When we did, Gentleman Adventurer, we rerecorded it with Johnny Mattock, Tim Harris, the best player bass player in the world, Max and me. And there was a vague idea around at the time that we might reanimate La Mer. And that's how  Tombé dans les pommes got written as a potential b side for something that may or may not happen.

Now, obviously, we didn't put La Mer on the LP. That would have been daft. But we thought, you know, keep it aside and just see what what may or may not come to pass with it. It's a bit of a tradition, though, thinking of, you know, a a French stomp song per album almost. Well, there's an element of that.

Maybe not as as I don't I don't think they're as prevalent as that. But, I mean, the very fact recurrence anyways. The yeah. I mean, I think the very fact that we felt compelled to come up with  Tombé dans les pommes as a potential b side goes to show that we didn't have that many songs in French. But that that was cool because no one had heard that, so we could put that on the record.

But we didn't wanna put La Mer on. But while we were mixing it, I was running a little sort of mental exercise in my head. And in French, in my head, I was writing the review of, this version of La Mar. And it was all basically about, oh, all the naive charm and, borderline incompetence of the first version that made it so particularly affecting is gone and has just been crushed under a tide of competent uselessness. You know?

I still prefer the new version. I got nothing against a bit of competence me. I'm talking of recurring themes that or not the French song is that recurring, but No. There's a first mention of elephants at least. Yes.

Well, you see, when I was I this I've told this so many times that it feels almost formulaic. But when I was at school, they used to try and teach us French. And to help with this, they had little flexi discs that would arrive. I think what happened was once a month, a comic would come, just a little four page comic, very cheaply produced, but it they'd always have these flexes and a song written out on the back. And even though I was, like, eight or nine years old, it did come to my attention that most songs in the French language appeared to be about elephants.

And so what La Mer is actually about is it's about how people felt. I'm not doing this very well. Just give me a minute. Yeah. Basically, it's about people trying to teach English kids French.

Yeah. And it's about how only very rather partial was their success as evidenced by the French in the lyric. And also the as a result of this attempt to educate me in the French language, I am now convinced that all French people are just obsessed with elephants. As you'll have noticed over the years, I'm quite fond of them too. But I have to say, when we, you know, when we sort of grew up and started touring and we started driving around France, you do see an awful lot of elephant logos and elephant related names of businesses.

Alright. Yeah. Yeah. They're very they are keen on their elephants and driving trains too fast. And do and do the French understand the bad French lesson joke in that song?

They definitely take a delight in the borderline competence of the French. Yeah. The when we first toured France, it was one of the last European countries to let us in. But we played some sort of weird indoor festival, and it was a it was a grand mallet. You know?

They really went for it. And so in early eighty six, we had a a two week tour of France, which is almost unheard of in at the club level. And we arrived to find much fanfare and audiences of, like, three to 500 kids everywhere we went. More or less everywhere we went. And the first night was in Cannes, And somebody said in the dressing room, you know, practical question.

Are we doing Stonehenge tonight? Someone went like, you know, are we gonna do La Mer? Now the first thing that happened was the the bass player, Felix, he goes, oh, I don't know that one. To which the three of us, Max Owen and me, all reply, you silly dick. We played it in Hamburg about three weeks ago.

But, you know, well, aren't we gonna do it then? And I was like, are you fucking mad? If we go out there and sing that at French people, they're gonna throw shit, man. Well, the gig went really well, and we got a second encore, and it's like, Graham still going, I don't know it. I don't know it.

It's it's a minor for Christ's sake. And, we went out and did it. And they went donuts. They went absolutely mental. '87, Alex and I did a tour.

Alex Green on the sax. Just me on guitar, him on the sax. I was not good enough on guitar to undertake such responsibility at the time, but that didn't hold us back. And we got to this gig in Paris at the Little Rex. And we did the set, and it was all very jolly, and they asked for more.

So we came out, and we played La Mer. And they went completely mad. And they bellowed for more, and we came back out. And they made us do La Mer again. Have you ever heard that Jonathan Richmond Live LP where they keep reprising ice cream man until everyone wants to die?

It's absolutely hilarious. Rolo, I love that. It's another story. It was like that, though. I think Alex and I came back out to play La Mer five, possibly six times.

Kevin, you mentioned Alex that reminds, reminds me of what I was thinking about about the saxophone and whether you felt and this because this reference in them includes driving or something about turning turning it off. Somebody turn that saxophone off. What he was putting me off, I was trying to do a little jam. I was saying, I need a taxi home. I need a taxi home.

But I couldn't pitch it because fucking Louie's going all over the place. And I just go, somebody turn that saxophone off. It was like like the get it out here. I don't want it. It's just like it wasn't stuff that was really supposed to be included, but when we heard it back, we thought, if we left it up.

I suppose everyone fell out of love with saxophones by the time the nineties arrived. So it just was natural evolution, was it, I guess? I'd I'd fallen out of love with saxophones. I used to be a saxophone player in the sonic tonics. I did singing.

You've got a saxophone on the front top of the disc. That is the Sonic Tonics. Mhmm. That picture is at the Clarington. Dave Barker came down to see us.

That's Max at the back. Alright. Makes me look like a blooming in with that picture. I I swear to god, Dave only signed us so that he could use that photograph he'd taken for his sleeve. I swear.

Because his old his old job, his day job was doing record sleeves, and I think he felt constrained, and he wanted to do his own record sleeves. And if that meant having to record records to do it, then he would. You know? But what was that about? No.

It's gone. Nope.

It's gone. Ball line confidence. We have just about covered this thing, haven't we? Yes. Bar barring the Barring sex with the dead.

Dead girlfriends. Yeah. Well, that, again, like so much of these things from this era, is anti's fault. There's a reason why they call him the Antichrist. And, we were mucking about.

Must have been sort of Christmas eighty one, because when college finished for him for the Christmas holidays, he'd come back. He he lived in Northampton. That's how I got to know him. So I'd see him over that Christmas, and we spent a fair bit of time together. And neither of us could play guitar, neither of us could sing, but we're both kind of interested in writing humorous tunes.

And I I was just doing this big dumb a minor g thing, and he was just jumping around the room going zombie love like this. And I was like, So when bored a week or so later on my own, I I cooked that up. And that is the reason. If I needed further pushing, that is why I adopted the name Jazz Butcher because I made a little tape of that and another couple of songs. And there was no way that I was gonna put my name on a cassette that had a song about having sex with dead people on it.

You know? I wasn't it wasn't that stupid. No. It's just a big dumb thing, but my god. The amount of mileage we got out of that song was ridiculous.

Because it's such a simple thing, you can, you know, you can just do so much with it. And it we used to finish the set with it for years. Eventually, it sort of all got a bit tired and formulaic, so I I stopped doing it. But Oh, it's a nice little rocking number. Yeah.

And, like, you know, you can you can take it right down in the middle, and we'd we'd I can remember I went through a phase on the 85. I'd been reading, Stephen King Pet Sematary. My wife loves Pet Sematary. Yeah. It's a good book.

Hey, Lou Reed, you rock and roll animal. So I was I was into this book. I was reading this book, and, yeah, the middle of zombie love suddenly just turned into, like, the first movie long before the original movie. There's there was our movie of the Pet Sematary used to happen in the middle of zombie love. They buried the cat on Friday.

Saturday morning, the cat came back. The old Germans would be going mad down the front. Saturday morning, the cat came back. The Germans would go a bit more madder. You go, Saturday morning, that cat came back.

Yeah. Loved it. Happy days. Before we finish, if we were being strictly chronological, should we have been thinking about Mark E Smith before this or not? I can't remember.

The the single? Yeah. That comes a ways after this. This was recorded over the August '82, Whereas we didn't record Southern Mark Smith until the September '83, and it only got written in about August. So that can be that can be for next time.

By all means. Let's see if we're still up and running. Yeah.

Beautiful. La dee da. La dee da. There you go. Oh, I remember that's that bloody record, isn't it?

Do you remember that one? After about forty minutes. Yeah. That was infuriating. I've just about shaken it out of my brain, and now it's back.

I remember being, particularly annoyed at the time by that was a some sort of French song, wasn't it? Yes. Yes. That was really annoying. And I think the Muppets did a version of it, which was, you know, classic.

I think the Muppets had already done a version of it. Yeah. I think we're gonna try and cover 83 and 84 today, if that's okay, being, trying to do things in order and all that? Now, see, this is my biggest beef with most rock books. First of all, we see them in the garage knowing nothing and knowing no one.

And the next thing, we see them with a record out and gigs in London and whatever. And for me, the really interesting bit has always been how did they get from the garage to the Garage in Islington. Yeah. There's a bit of a there's a definite transformation, isn't there, between Bath and Bohemia and and what goes on in between? Yeah.

What goes on in between, apart from anything else, is that, I think, what I described in the sleeve notes is a Byzantine episode of bass player wrestling, which no doubt we will get to. But yeah. Yeah. It was it was an interesting time. And I always remember the very first day of 1983.

We'd had a little bit of a party, and Eider was up from London. I think Jonesy was there. Her mate, KB, he was there. And on the January 1, we We didn't quite know what to do, so we went and had a curry at the Star of India. I always remember that.

And I remember someone had a copy of the old Private Eye, oddly enough. And on the front cover of Private Eye, there was a photograph of Yasser Arafat. And he was at the time, he was, like, down in favor, and his career wasn't looking like it was going anywhere much in a at the beginning of '83. And so the front cover of this private eye, he was there, and there was a speech bubble going, why don't you throw in the towel? To which Massey Yasser Arafat replied, I can't.

I need it to wrap around my head. That was that's the first thing I remember from 1983. The re fortunately, the recall isn't all quite as total as that. And they're still throwing back, towel head out as in in parliament in the last week or so, mister Desai, our Sikh member from Salal or wherever he's from. Some people can't tell the difference between Sikhs and Taliban, can they?

I mean, what? That that's, that's, poor. That is like I'm sorry, sir, but your opinion is valueless. If you can't tell a Hungarian from a Portugese, get out of my sight. So I think, that there's, going back to the turn of '83 then.

Yeah. I think it's fair. I mean, Bath was in the can as it were. We had no idea if or when it would come out. And so at the very beginning of '83, we didn't really exist in any meaningful way.

There wasn't really a we. You know? One thing that was hugely important at the beginning of '83 was, John Kale did a solo concert at a place called The Venue in Victoria. Used to be related to Virgin Industries, I think. And, yeah, he went down there and, like, just solo guitar and solo piano.

And I think about 30 of our mates went to that that night. We just went there totally mop handed. And I swear to God, he changed everybody's lives, really, just to see him doing it. And I can remember saying to, Dave J on the night. I was saying, you know that John Cale?

He can't he can't really play guitar much better than you or me, can he? And Dave is a bit sore. Don't know about that. He's a god. But, I think it is true.

He's not he's not that great a guitarist. But you don't have to be if you got a good song. And this was sort of coinciding this time with the demise of the granddads of goth, I guess. So that was a sort of happy When did they go down? It probably was '83, I think, at some point.

Yeah. Yeah. Because late eighty two, we supported them at the Hammersmith Palais in the face of spectacular hostility. That was really good fun. Yeah.

I imagine it. Because they just hit the charts. So, I mean, a lot of people, they weren't even Bauhaus fans. They were just people who like trying to be fashionable, you know, and picked up their hair and put on a black T shirt and wanted to be whacked about with loud noises. And we went on there, and we did Partytime.

We did Love Kittens. They were like, fuck off. And I was looking down at all the gorillas down the front. Fruity is Hammersmith Palais. You know, he's we'd never played anywhere like that before.

And there are all these traps showing up. For the first time in my life, I thought, this is brilliant. These bouncers, this is brilliant. They can't hert us. Let's do another slow one.

I saw Kevin Haskins after that, and I thought it must he was the only one that I knew. Then I said to him, well, you know, thanks for the, thanks for the experience, Kev. You know, it's nothing to do with me. Turned out to be his brother. Turned out to be Dave watching from a distance.

It was his bright idea to get us on. So that was the '82. And in '83, they pulled a similar trick. They went down to, Hammersmith Palais. They did two nights.

And, again, they brought local supports from Northampton, though on this occasion, not us. And those were the last two gigs. That was it. There's a very weird atmosphere at the time, actually. So, yeah, they would have gone down sometime, I guess, the '83.

And then, Southern Mark Smith, in the '83. Yeah. We re we recorded that the August at Beck in Wellingborough. And it had only really been written a little while before. I think the first the very first attempt at it probably came at Easter that year, because I can remember watching the teatime news alone in the flat.

And a fellow came on, and he said, thousands of people queuing in the rain to meet the pope. And I just started writing it down. There was a whole load of stuff about Lady Di in the original draft as well, because I was basically just copying down what I heard on the news and kinda sculpting it into some shape. And So maybe there was there was shuttle trips as well then. Shuttle trips?

Into space. Yeah. That's probably what that was. Yeah. But the lyric kind of boiled itself down over the summer to where we recorded it, the first version.

And then, of course, it it got recorded again with slightly different words because I thought I'd matured. So Kevin must have been free to play drums and, and Kevin was well up for it. Yeah. And Jones Owen wasn't really on the scene at that point. We had the sort of the very first lineup of the group.

We had a drum machine to do that to the beats. We had Rolo playing bass, Alice playing keys, me and Max, and occasionally the idiot sax player Louie. And, that sort of stayed that way into '83. And then round about springtime '83, Woody's started getting going, wooden tops. Okay.

Yep. Sorry. It takes a bit of remembering, obviously. So the band that recorded Southern Mark Smith was basically it was Rolo, Alice, Max, and Me, but with Kev playing the drums. But that was pretty much the last thing that that lineup did because Roe was off to do what he's, and he took Alice with him.

And that coincided with me splitting up with Alice. And that all happened on the weekend of the September 25 where we were playing a CND benefit in Abington Park. And an interesting thing happened there. Instead of doing the bandy thing, we turned up, and there was Eider had his electric. I had an acoustic.

And Rolo also had an acoustic, but he'd laid it strings down in his lap and gaffer taped a tambourine to it and was basically playing drums by bashing on acoustic guitar with a tambour. And it was a glorious afternoon. We were all on acid, and the trees looked fucking marvelous in Abington Park. And, I've got no idea what the set was like. It went down fairly well.

And then after that, there was a big bus stop because Alice found me with a local punk rocker girl, and she went steaming off in a huff and nicked one of the kittens, which is a small price to pay. That was the death of it. And then through the autumn of '83, Max and I, we'd heard the Jacobites by then, and we liked what we heard. We liked the two guitar, big, dumb, three chord songs. In fact, we loved it.

And so we resolved to go out just as a duo like that. And in November and early December, we did a string of dates supporting the newly solo Dave J. And we started getting halfway decent at that, and it was all quite enjoyable. I mean, there was only the two of us. We could go where we liked and do what we wanted.

But in very early '84, we came up against the brick wall that people lovingly call reality. And at a gig at Central London Poly, we spent an hour and a half failing to sound check two guitars and two mics. Student student, sound engineer. And the gig just ended in utter chaos and hostility. I mean, looking back, I'd have loved to have watched that gig, but, just not to be.

I was too busy shouting at people. Our pal you remember I mentioned the Antichrist last week? Mhmm. Yeah. He was he was on that trip, and it ended up with him dragging a stepladder onto the stage, climbing to the top of it, and just sitting on the top of the stepladder shouting at the audience for no apparent reason.

That was a great night. But after that, Dave Barker comes in and he goes, you're gonna have to get yourselves rhythm section. And that's round about that point in early '84. I was at Max's house one Sunday morning, and we heard hammering coming from the kitchen. Boom.

Boom. Boom. And on going in to investigate, we found this bearded long hair building himself a mini bedroom in the kitchen with some sort of kind of partition of hair. For it was Jones. And, him and him and Max had been at school together, and they they played together before in that in bands in, Oxford.

At one point, they were both in Sonic Tonics with me and John. And so Max decided, oh, well, that's an end to our drummer problems then. I said, well, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Because Owen wasn't all out on the drums in them days.

And I was like, well, let us hold on a moment here. He can play the drums on two conditions. One, he gets that fucking beard off. Two, he's only allowed kick drum, high hat, and snare. And so, Owen, was ushered in.

Then, of course, we needed a bass player. And what we did was we stole the guy who'd been playing bass with Dave J on that tour back in November. Guy called Steve Musgrove. Absolutely brilliant bass player. You didn't have to tell him anything.

You know, he just knew where things are going and could play just off the bat inspired player. Played double bass as well, which is glorious. But as a musician, top rank. As a geezer equipped for getting from one place to another by a certain time, not so clever. But, yeah, he he he lasted the early stages of '84, and then Dave got involved.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself here. But, yeah, it it was that was how we went from being a small band full of mates who were mucking about to a duo and then to the sort of genesis of the actual quartet that made Scandal in Bohemia. And Marnie's in the middle there somewhere, the early version of it, the single version of it in January, I read. Yeah. I think we made it in January '84.

I think it probably came out a tiny bit after. Mick Mercer's review in Zig Zag. But soft, what yell from yonder greenhouse breaks? I love my notes. Thinking about some of the, lyrical things in Sweet Jane, the your version of Sweet Jane.

I can't remember the version that we did on the Marnie record particularly, except for Dave Barker getting hold of one of those ridiculous Linn DRum things and going. Sweet Jane. That was all done really, really fast. The whole the whole EP was done in a day. And like the front side, we we took some effort and, you know, put some instruments on and did some mixing.

The b side was really just like me and Eider strumming them out real quick without really any thought. Because we were on dead time in, DeWolf Studios in Soho. Oh, I was thinking of, reference to Sterling. Was there a cat called Sterling at the time? Yeah.

Sterling was the son of Moe. He was a big, stripy orange cat, tomcat, who was a very good friend of mine. Stayed with me for a few years. And, yeah, he gets a name check there. And, just, just for completeness, going back to '83 and Southern Mark Smith and, did, I think I know that, again, I was reading online just before we came out.

Did you know someone has written a something like a 34 part blog on Jazz Butcher songs? Is that Michael Whitworth? Yeah. Yeah. It's very comical.

He is, I don't know if he's a professor or not, but he's a a teacher, if you will He is a lecturer, I think. Of English at Merton College where I went. And when we did the He's got a thesis going on there. It's yeah. I've read it, actually.

It's quite flattering and largely very astute. He he he generally when he makes a what's the word I want? Well, a short word is guess. When he a conjecture. He generally seems to land it about right.

He was very good on Scarlet, I remember. But, you know, he's bringing a level of textual analysis to it that most people don't really bother with. Yeah. So he describes, sort of Mark Smith as an oxymoron, which I suppose is the point, isn't it? The Yeah.

I I used to say to people it's like a wet desert. Yeah. Yeah. And did, Mark was Mark himself ever ever aware of it or comment on it? Oh, yeah.

Few months after it come out, we got a letter, And it was on this kind of DIY letterhead that said, The Fool, Prestwich. And it began, dear jazz butchers, we are still working your hard to read out, but it is very pleasant work. Signed, the fool. Now what was worrying about the word that we couldn't read is it started with r e. And for about two days, I thought it said revenge.

Turned out it was record. We're still working your record out, but it's a very pleasant work. And He wasn't after you after all. No. And in fact, it's quite the opposite.

He, over 84, we got quite a few supports with them around about the country. It's just and he was always nothing but friendly and gentlemanly towards us. He was a sweetheart. I can remember bumping into him at a gig once in, London. We were having a pint, and he said I told him, oh, yeah.

We're going into Europe. We're going on a tour of Europe. And he put his arm around my shoulder and said, always get your carnet. Probably your what? Sorry.

Your carnet. You know what those are. Right? Okay. Well, a carnet is a marvelous thing.

And, And, of course, we haven't had them for years, and musicians at the minute are all grumbling about this Brexit insanity because they think they're gonna have to have their carnees again. And a carnet was a massive great sheaf of papers that you carried in the van. And listed upon it was every instrument, every lead, every stand, everything that you were transporting. And every time you hit an international border, Philip would have to park up the motor car, take this Carnet thing into an office, and get a geezer to go through it and stamp it. Boom.

Boom. And this proved that we hadn't been buying gear and moving it from country to country and avoiding duty and stuff, you know. And, yeah, if you didn't have one, you're an idiot. And, the great thing about the carnet, of course, was that while Phil was in the, in the cupboard doing it, it gave all the sort of junior customs officers and junior border guards the opportunity to notice that there were some funny looking musicians in a van that they could poke around. Yeah.

You're automatically targets, I imagine, at most borders. That's it. And you're sitting there helpless. You know? You're just stuck in your van with nowhere to go, and these guys are poking through the window.

Should we should we do them, boss? And, the funniest one of that there are there are a couple of amusing ones, but my favorite one was, at the Italian border coming out of Switzerland. And we're at the border to Italy, and Phil was off doing the papers because we'd always got a carnet. And ignore that. I shall.

And, while he was in the shed, sure enough, two very, very young Italian champs in enormous official coats started nosing around the bus and, like, looking in through the windows. And he was, oh, good. Here we go. Drop them. And, eventually, one of these kids comes up and taps on the window, and I wind the window down.

It's like, you know, buon giorno, officer o. And he says, you are and I'm about to go, yes, a band. And he goes, jazz butcher? And I oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Here we are. Do you want a badge? They went off wearing little jazz butcher patches on their coats.

So it wasn't all bad. That was like that time we went to America. Did I tell you about that? Coming in in '88, and it was the '88 version of the band, it was the first time they'd ever been to America. I was the only one who'd been before.

I'm gonna fucking break that thing. We could switch to answer phone by now if you had one. It doesn't work. It'll ring. If I answer it, I will just hear and no voice.

The fuck knows what they're hearing. It's usually me saying phone the fucking mobile, you fucking cheapskate. Right. Off is the direction in which we have fucked, is it? Sorry.

It really, really winds me up then. Because it's so pointless. There's no point picking it up. You won't hear anything. You know?

It's just rubbish. It's usually Mulreany phoning from Australia. It's like he's got my mobile number. Oh, what the fuck? What?

Genius. This fucking Dhiren. Absolute genius. Do you need us to stop? You're right.

Sorry? Do you need us to stop? You're right. Sorry. Hello.

Hello. Hello. Hello. Are you well? Yeah.

Yeah. Good. Thank you. It's very good. Yeah.

Sorry. I hope I didn't fuck your recording. I just, was thinking I could be out there for a while. Yeah. I I I don't really know the answer.

I mean, I think the thing to do is to hammer on the door, but of course if we're talking, we aren't necessarily even here that. I think it's the, just a bit of distance. Not to worry. I'm in now. Good.

Terrific. Alright. Oh, I've got totally lost track of where the fuck we were now. I don't don't know what's going on. Off on the Italian border.

Oh, that's right. It was the whole business of getting you carnet, cock. Yeah. Yeah. And and, and some, American border incident or Oh, how it's happening.

Yes. That's right. '88, the beginning of that tour. No one had been to America before except me and filled a tour manager. And we came to JFK.

And you know at JFK, like, you clear immigration and all that nonsense, and then you go down this massive long corridor before you hit customs. And we were going down there, and I was kinda, like, leading the way as it happened just by chance. I was at the front. And I saw further down the corridor coming this way, a fellow in customs uniform. And I could see that he was taking an interest.

I could see that we'd been clocked. To use the local vernacular, I knew that we had been made. And, nothing I can do. I've gotta go this way. He's coming that way.

Nothing we can do. And as we get closer, it's very clear. He's looking me up and down. He's checking me out. He's looking at the lads behind me.

So, oh, Christ. On a bike. Now what? Comes the moment where we meet. Sure enough, he stops me.

Sure enough, he speaks to me. And in front of an astonished band just behind me, he goes, gee. Are you guys still on creation records? So, you know, sometimes you get a pleasant surprise. Yeah.

I think when we last went into when we went into into America this year, you know, we were a little tired after a fourteen hour flight via Phoenix, Arizona for some reason. And, of course, being starved deliberately starved of oxygen to save money. Yeah. And and the the customs guy, said, in effect, cheer up. You're on vacation.

You know? Because that's real quite serious. And you you do put your serious face on when you go through security, don't you? Sometimes. Did did we do the great Canada problem?

The great Canada airport terrorism incident? Well, I guess, you know, I was saying we should talk about the work and not the funny stories. Right? But these things come up, don't they? Yeah.

They add color. Yeah. Canada was the funniest one. Like, god knows how many times I've told this story. It was which tour?

Which tour? Which tour? It's not making any sense. It was either '89 or '90. And it would have been '80 oh, or was it '92?

I don't think it was '92. It was '89 or '90. It was the Mulreany Mulreany O'Keefe type lineup. And we were in Ottawa. And I don't know if you know it, but we were on, Mercury label up there.

So it was our only brush with major record labels. And in terms of publicity, they used to work my little socks off. And as we were setting up for the Ottawa gig, one of the reps from Polygram said to me, oh, Pat, is it alright if you, just drive directly to Toronto tonight after the show? And I said, why? Well, they've got a slot for you on, on television in Toronto at 03:30 tomorrow afternoon.

I said, for us? She said, no. No. For you. Just me.

Yeah. So you're asking me to make my band, who've already checked into their hotel, by the way, you're asking me to make my band abandon their hotel beds and drive through the night 300 miles or whatever it is to Toronto just so that I alone can appear on television. They're all gonna get mucked about so that I can be on television in Canada. Is that the story? Yeah.

Yeah. Is that okay? No. It's not okay. And, record company Bird looks a bit upset and crestfallen.

You know? I said, no. I'm I'm not doing it. That's that's the sort of thing that makes bands fall out. I I will not do that to my band for the sake of just what appears, at least, to them to just be my ego being on the telly on my own.

You know? I'm not doing it. And I thought, I know what will shut him up. I said, if you want me to do that, you'll have to fly me. And I thought I thought, that's it.

Game set match. She can fuck off. We'll do a gig now. Yeah. She came back with airplane tickets, didn't she?

Just for me. Just for me. And in due course, I was delivered to the airport in Ottawa at something like 07:30 in the morning, still drunk. And I negotiate my way through checkin. I negotiate my way through security.

I negotiate my my way all the way to the final little desk in the little glass shed before you get on the airplane. And at that point, things went a bit wrong. There was this kid. Oh, you took it this time. I did.

It was a bloody godsend. Good. Makes life unbelievably easier. Yep. Figures.

Yeah. Yeah. It does. But I just thought that the sort of impracticality of having to lock it up places and Mhmm. Wander off would be too much of a faff.

But actually the distance is so fucking stupid that, actually it makes an enormous difference. And, I got the front end of an Aston Martin to bring home. That was that green shit you were carrying? That was that green shit that I was carrying. It's an Aston Martin.

Great chunks of carbon fiber from the front of an Aston Martin. Bloody hell. Yeah. Mental. They were just slinging it in the bin.

And I said, woah. Don't sling that in the bin. I'll put that on eBay. Bloody really lovely on my wall with my Porsche wheel arch. Anyway, that's the level of sadness, but I got a lot of jealous looks Okay.

From people. It was nice. And, they're just nicer meetings. It feels like racing in the way that racing used to be Yeah. At the slightly smaller events.

It's all run by Spaniards as well so it was super sorry about that. So it's all, yeah. Super friendly and, really nice. And you could wander in right onto the pit lane. Right.

Right in and speak to drivers and mechanics and things like that and watch the pit stops actually happening right there, which, Under your nose, sort of thing. Which is great. Really great. Cool. And I managed to have a quick one with Darren Turner who I've tried to now, but most races that he's at, I missed him last week.

But, Is that Darren Turner of Darren Turner Overdrive? It is Darren Turner of Darren Turner Overdrive. He, ain't seen nothing yet. So I've heard. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. That's that's that's what he says to me all the time. But I've seen him too many races now. He's certainly seen something.

He's certainly a lie. It must be a lie. But I don't mind him lying to me. He's a long one winner and I'll yeah. So he comes with innate forgiveness.

I'm gonna take my, shit talking nonsense elsewhere and leave you to it. Super though. Lovely to see you. And I will catch you in a little bit. I'll catch you in a while.

Yeah. Lovely. Thanks. Yeah. So there I am on my pilgrimage to do telly, severely weakened by my experiences, and I make it all the way to the little desk just before the aeroplane.

And there's this little lad there with a kind of training mustache and an ill fitting uniform. And I've got my instrument, obviously, in the case, and, I pop the instrument pop the case down, and he says, oh, could you, open the case, please, sir? I went, yeah. Sure. Dink.

Dink. Dink. Opened it up. Fender El Rio 1985 vintage lying in the case. He looks at it and goes, what's that, sir?

At this point, my patience deserted me. And I said to him, that young man is 14 kilograms of prime checkers with vacuum Semtex explosives. For as you can see, I am a mad Iranian Mullah, and I'm going to blow that little motherfucker out of the sky. To which he replies, could you stay there please, sir? And wanders off.

Like, you know, if I genuinely was a terrorist, he probably hadn't done the right thing. Right? So he goes wandering off, and he comes back with one, two, three mounties. The little red coats, the baggy pants, the silly little smoky bear hats. Yep.

He's got mounties, and the mounties take me away to the funny room. And they say, sir, you can't be making jokes like that. Hey. It's not responsible. Hey.

At the airport, it's not funny. Hey. No. That's not funny at all, sir. No.

And I'm getting all this rah rah rah rah. And they don't seem to have any particular serious intent. I'm not particularly exercised. I'm just sort of like going, fuck's sake. The boy was an idiot.

You know? And I said, well, we're we're gonna have to go and fetch the dog, sir. We're gonna have to go and fetch the drug doggy. And I heard you. Because I knew I didn't have any drugs on me, so I wasn't bothered about this.

And so off they fucked. And not long after they'd fucked off, airplane took off, leaving me in the funny room. And I waited and I waited. After about a quarter of an hour, I thought, this is a rum do. So I went and tried the door, which was open.

So I let myself out. I walked back the way that I came back into the front hall of the airport without being bothered, went to a payphone, called up the record company and said, you better send a car. And, of course, they did send a car, which is great because I could get in the back seat and go to go to sleep until we hit Toronto. All for the sake of some fatuous five minute appearance on some stupid Canadian version of MTV with someone who was completely uninterested in what we were doing anyway. You know?

But, yeah. And you didn't have any vid you didn't even have, video to play, I guess? Probably not. I mean, I don't know. I mean, we used to have a few videos at the time.

We did videos for Spooky and Girl Go and couple of other things. But I can't like, you you know, I mean, that's just advertising. I'm not concerned with advertising. I I make it. You sell it.

You know? I'm not I'm not really concerned with publicity. Obviously, because you're the lead singer and the songwriter, it all falls on you. And one reason I was so keen not to put the band out was that if you're in the band and you're not the lead singer, and I know this. I've had conversations about this.

If you're in the band and you're not the lead singer and you're not doing all the publicity, every time the lead singer goes off with some bird from the record company or some local DJ or whatever in a sports car, Everyone in the band just knows that he's having a little ego wank and, you know, it's like, oh, look at him swanning around like a bleeding pop star with his record company people in their open top motor. You know? Actually, I'm going, mate, if you don't get me back for soundcheck, my band are gonna fucking beat me up. You know, I I didn't wanna be anywhere. I was I was there to do gigs, and soundchecks are the most important part of the gig, really.

And, they used to drive me up the bloody wall. I'm just I used to spend the whole time in a state of sort of frustration and rage and people going, hey. See, what about your new record, What about it? What do you wanna know? Why am I here?

I should be at soundcheck. Really? What's your soundcheck, You know? Fuck. Going back to, the transformation from, you know, garage band to Sorry.

Yeah. We to professional musicians. I was Got an issue with that. Of of the, the b side to Southern Mark Smith. I don't wanna get into, every single covering every single trap, but we'll try and see if we can do it during the course of the conversations.

So JB versus Count Dracula was a was a bit of a another comedy record, comedy track. How do you see that? Yeah. And that had a video. Ah, now that yes.

The video for that. That's a good story. Yeah. I think the inspiration for the tune was a dream that I had, and it was a great dream. It was early twenties kids' typical house party in a regular house like this in Northampton.

And, you know, there was a a room of people playing music and dancing. There was a room of people sitting around watching TV and taking drugs. It was a just little typical kids' house party. And, I went to this thing, but it being a dream and everything, the bloke who came to the party with me was none other than Count Dracula. And it all it all ended up I can remember this like I was there.

It ended up that we were in the in the drugs and telly room sitting in a darkened room, smoking too much spliff, watching a Dracula movie on TV with Count Dracula. And, I don't know. I mean, I really like that idea of, you know, they used to get things like scientist versus the evil vampires, for example. Close enough for rock and roll, isn't it? You know, like, scientist always had dub dub dub albums with mad titles like that.

And so I always wanted to sort of you know, because I I I still felt very divorced from the jazz butcher. I still thought of him as, like, this enormous African bloke. Didn't didn't really connect the Jazz Butcher with the pasty white geezer from Northampton. You know? That story wondered, today whether it was a bit of a coincidence that, you know, you're record you're you're recording songs about Count Dracula with with a quarter of the of the granddads of Goth.

You know? Kev was well into that one. There's a good story about Kev on that, actually. But, damn, I nearly I nearly had something important to say there, but I just derailed myself. The Cramps.

That's what I was gonna say. You have to understand that in the 1983, Dave Barker was very clever, the Glass bloke. He was very clever. He used to bring us cassettes of shit to listen to, whereby he sort of programmed us. And we'd spent the summer I especially had spent the summer listening to the Cramps.

And I think that's where I got the idea of a stealing wild thing, which is, of course, what a Southern Mark Smith is. And, also, that sort of rockabilly beat that you get on Count Dracula. And the daft 1950s caveman chorus. Again, that's this is me taking piss taking the piss out of how Hollywood and the sort of mass media see music. Like, you know, I was saying, like, Chinatown is full of stuff like that.

And the the the again, this was like, you know, like, let's let the ceremony begin. No. No. No. No.

You know, that that yeah.

It was a sort of collision between the Cramps and and hammer, which, of course, I've grown up with because of Terry. So, yeah, that was the inspiration for it. But Kev played the drum part, and it was all tom-toms and snare. Like, when we we put it down live and, you know, Kev, it was also a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom, check a boom. No real high-hats or cymbal involved.

And so we got that down and get happy backing track for that and we're doing bits of dubs. And Kevin said to uh Derek Thompkins the engineer proprietor of Beck.

He said, you know, who'd been recording Bauhaus since day one. That's where they did, Bela Lugosi. And Kev says to Derek, Derek, I I just wanna I wanna do a dub if I can. I just wanna, like, get the old rivets cymbal, you know, and just run it all the way through. So, like, give it that kind of old fifties rock and roll sound.

And Derek, who even then was quite an old boy, turned around, and he said, over, Dub? Over, Dub? You can't even play the fucking drums, boy. The rest of us were like, you can't talk to him like that. He's been on top of the pops.

But, of course, he could talk to him like that. You know? Because I I think I said, didn't I, that, the only reason that Bela Lugosi is dead is in Bossa Nova is that it was the only beat that Kevin knew at the time other than just rock one. And that's you know, he'll tell you the same thing. I'm not I'm not being a gossip there.

It was he had two beats, and it wasn't gonna be rock one. So it had to be bossa. But, yeah, there was Derek, you know, two or three years down the track after they become quite successful. You can't even fucking play the fucking drums, boy. But he let him do it.

But and but then by April, there's Roadrunner and Rain and and Drink. Right. Well, this Rain, Yeah. And and and starting to starting to sound quite tight because uncle Dave's on the roster. Well, I mean, to be fair Or it it to be fair, Rolo, who preceded him as bass player, was I don't think David have too much problem with this.

I think that at the time, at any rate, Rolo was a better bass player than he was. I would say Rolo's a fantastic bass player. He's completely wasted bashing that acoustic and singing. He's a brilliant, brilliant bass player. He's like he's got that spring like Horace in the Specials.

You know? He's just got a fantastic spring. But suddenly in April '84, though, those recordings I felt. It feels like a like a professional ensemble. Not you know?

No disrespect to the previous. Well now, same studio, back again. Yeah. And it is funny because, like, as I say, end of January, the dream of doing it acoustic in public is kind of collapsing around our ears, and we're being told to get a drummer and that. And then we do a few gigs with Mazi on the, on the bass, and we're starting to make little inroads.

We we got gigs with him. We were, like, played the Fridge in Brixton and places like that. So we were starting to make inroads as a quartet even then. And Dave, by then, was socializing. And, the idea was that Dave would produce our next record.

That was that was the plan. But I think it was actually after that Fridge gig that Muzzy had been such a handful just to get him there. It involved using up my lunch hour at work. I had to go out of work, go to the station, buy a ticket, catch a bus, find Muzzy, put the railway ticket in his hand, and then go back to work. That was what was going on there.

And, it just became too much hard work to keep Muzzy in the band, really. And, you know, it's not fair to question his commitment because he was only a sort of hired hand to begin with, really. He's only sort of, like, checking it out. So, like, it didn't feel like we were turning him over by leaving him behind in any way, and I don't think he was that concerned. But then a new bass player was required.

So the man of whom we had stolen Massey ended up being the bass player, and that's how Dave came in. And, yeah, April '84. You see how quickly all that happened? But, yeah, we had been we had sneaked into London once or twice to do proper gigs by then. And then when Dave joined, obviously, that got a lot of attention because he'd been in Bauhaus, and Bauhaus had been in the top 20 sort of thing.

You know? So, obviously, that did a lot of good for our public profile, if you like. And did you choose to release a cover for sort of cynical? Well, this I I I think we can I think we can genuinely lay this one at the door of Dave Haskins because you got to remember that that one of the last things the Bauhaus did was to put out that copy of, that cover of Ziggy Stardust? And I can remember them saying in public, and I can remember Dave saying in private as well, we've been knocking on the door at a chance now for a couple of years.

We decided to stop knocking and kick it in. Yeah. And I think Dave had basically come into the band and decided that we should do exactly the same thing Yeah. With Roadrunner. Here's a formula that Yeah.

Might help. And, you know, it's a jolly tune, and we all knew it. And, so it got recorded. Yeah. And some of the, variations, lyrical variations fell in love with Blackthorn and Northampton.

Yeah. Well, you know, you wanna it's not a question of making it your own, but there has got you know, you've gotta have something of yourself in it. And, yeah, that space in the middle. And that's a that's a true story. Max did actually manage to get completely lost, just fall off the map just traveling from Wellingborough to Northampton.

And, he's famous for his poor sense of direction. I remember once in Bristol, we walked out of a house to go somewhere, and he turned left, so I knew to turn right. It's as simple as that. And the Sikorsky's from hell. Is that a is that a Richmond a rip thing, or is that an invention?

The Sikorsky's from hell goes back to me and Rolo taking acid in the front room at Landau Road in Clapham. And there had been a story on the news about a Sikorsky helicopter that crashed in the English Channel somewhere near the Channel Islands And tripping our brains out fiercely at about 07:00 one evening, we had a picture rather in the manner of a heavy metal album cover of this flaming Sikorsky helicopter with fangs reemerging from the seas. It was Sikorsky from hell. And it was at a gig in the '83. Oh, this is a really important gig in our history, actually, but I'll go into that later.

At this gig, Max was on holiday. The sax player was on holiday. So there was just a drum machine, Rolo, Alice, and me. When you think that Alice and me couldn't really play, this is quite a challenge. Oddly enough, that was an evening where that same evening.

Fucking hell. It's all coming together in my mind. I'm sorry it's so fragmentary, but you'll see it when it's all down. This is July '83. It's the Ad Lib Club in West London.

Nobody's there. Actually, no. That's not true. That's not true, but a small crowd is there. Among them, Kevin Haskins.

And we do this gig. There's no Eider. There's no jazzy sax player. And all we've really got to go on is, you know, a reliable drum machine, a top bass player, and enthusiasm. That's all we've got.

Goes a long way in enthusiasm. And, also, we looked fucking cool, Wish it a weird thing to say about yourself, but we did that, like, by accident. And one of the things that we'd done in a sort of punk way is that Rolo had taken a sheet of A4 and a Sharpie, and he had written on it, Sikorsky's from hell, and shoved it on a mic stand where the punters could see it. And it's just a shitty piece of paper with Sikorsky's from hell. And the most beautiful thing is he hadn't even spelled it right.

He put Sikorsky's from hell. And I Sikorskis from hell. Yeah. Practically. Yeah.

Yeah. And I just loved that. And, yeah, because we just had, like, nothing to go on but enthusiasm and punk rock. We just went for it, made a filthy racket, had a really good time. And then at the end of it, Kevin jumped up and played the drums on Roadrunner, which is probably the first time we've done Roadrunner out.

So that's '83. So it'd been around a while when Dave decided to kick the door in. Oddly enough, it didn't work because, we had very few defenders in the English music press at that point. There were some nice people at, Music Week. They used to say nice things about us, especially about that gig in July at the Ad Lib club.

It was a really important night, actually. We just didn't know it at the time, and it really pumped us up. It it took away all the sort of initial faux jazz stylings and just stripped it down so that we could kind of rebuild on that model when Max came back from his holidays. We were sort of, like, ready to say, well, it's like this now. You know?

And, so that was all that was all very good. But one of our few defenders in the sort of public music press was Mick Mercer and the Melody Maker, and he also wrote for Zig Zag Woods. He was the editor of. And we we we put out this the Roadrunner single, and we thought, well, you know, Mick will back us. Turned out Mick really dislikes Jonathan Richman.

And, his review of our single of Roadrunner concluded with, it may be sunny outside, but in my heart, it's pissing down. So we totally let him down on that one and, didn't quite get the support we were hoping for. I, I wondered, but I think my research, my rather poor research before I came out today, made me realize that what I thought for a while about there being some Heseltine Westland helicopter scandal connection with the Sikorskis. Uh-huh. I was wrong because that wasn't Then it was too late.

Yeah. I was 85 or 86, I discovered today. Yes. It was the '85. I can remember hearing it on the radio.

Were in the news quite a bit. You know? Yes. Now this this predates it, and, I don't even know if the helicopter that crashed was a Sikorsky, but It's a good name. We were on acid.

We were talking helicopters, and we knew that Sikorsky's were helicopters. So, yeah, the Sikorsky's from hell. I I I really like Rain. It's one of my favorites. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. I and and that's that sounds feels like a quite grown up pop record. I always think of it as a rather juvenile pop record. I don't sort of stands the test of time quite well. I can remember writing it.

I I came walked home from work to Birchfield Road where I was living in the upstairs flat, and I literally walked in, picked up a guitar, and started I'm just hitting D and G. You know? No big deal. But it just kind of fell out, and I'd been listening a lot to various Lou Reed acoustic things, bootlegs and that. And, I felt somehow as I as I put it down on the old Amstrad, on the old sort of one track, you know, as I as it built up, a sort of drone thing started happening.

And I was thinking, oh, this is this is Velvets. This is like, I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead by some mutual friend, Wild Child. And so I thought, well, I'll pursue it and chased it down. And I think, you know, by suppertime, it was it was in the on the cassette. It happened real, real fast.

And I I do sort of feel that some of the lyrics show that they've been written real real real fast. And I've always wanted to change them, and I've never got around to it. And, of course, the in the middle has complete lift of, what Rolo was doing at the time. He had a song called Good Sing, and that was kind of slow and loping in African. It was like, But, basically, the vocal line is just a is just a lift.

And quite often, we'd be singing it live, and someone would get in the gap and go, good thing. Just to let them know that we knew. But, yeah, I mean, throw throw away pop, really. The and the first drinking song. Ah, yes.

Yes. If it weren't for heavy drink, he would never play sweet Jane. Yeah. Marvelous. I remember the afternoon he brought that to me.

I I did write a couple of the lines of the lyrics, actually, but I can't really remember which ones. I think the one about going astray and all the parts from here to Mandalay is probably my work. But, yeah, he'd he'd got the whole thing in the can, basically. And, yeah, that was nice. Bone.

Ah, rum boom. Who plays the trombone? I don't know the guy's name. We phoned up Louie, the daft sax player, who'd got some mates. You know, he used to play in jazz groups and soul groups and things in a horn section.

And it was I think it was Dave's idea. It's like, let's let's get some, like, you know, Memphis style horns on it. Just go wap wap wap. And so we spoke with Louis, and he organized a trumpet player and a trombone player and himself to come up from London. And they wanted £40.

£40. It's a lot of money. Well, it was a it was 84. But even so, £40. Three of them.

A 100 miles. You know? And I was talking to Dave Barker on the phone about this. I was going, yeah. We wanna get horns on it, and we've we've organized it.

We've got some guys. What do they want? They they want £40. Don't know about that pushing the boat out a bit with me. So a sort of tug of love started to take place.

And eventually, Dave conceded the £40, and the horn players arrived and went. And, hence, when the trombone solo arrives on drink, hence, I just triumphant cry of, trombone. Because we'd fought for that trombone. Sounds good, I think. It's it's super.

I all I can remember is the guy was called Paul. I can't remember his second name. And, that there's a bit of a connection. You know, obviously, there there's a sort of drinking song song about drinking on the scandal as well. And, Oh, the Soul Happy Hour.

Which, I was thinking today, lyrically, is, you know, dated by both the SDP and Quinn and Collins. Yeah. Well, that record really annoyed me when they did, Pale Blue Eyes. I just I just thought, why are you big girl's blouses fannying about with pale blue eyes? You've got quite enough songwriting talent between the two of you.

What the fuck do you think you're playing at? I expect they thought they were gonna kick the door in just like Dave did. But, there you go. No. That that really bugged me, that record side.

That can be anything, that line, when I'm singing live. And, of course, you know, you can give them to the SDP. It's long been you can give it to the Spacemen three. Basically, going, I suppose, you know, the best things in life are free and, well, so are magic mushrooms. You know?

Those were the days when we thought political parties had some longevity about it. Not so much these days. I never thought the SDP was gonna have any longevity about it. I'm not a man for splitters. Let let alone the independent group.

It's just like the waiting room for joining the Liberal Democrats, ain't it? Yeah. What a load of rubbish. Change UK. I think you'll think you'll find that particular syllable has been a bit worn out the last ten years, kids.

You know? And, like, what do they wanna change? Nothing. They want it to be 1998 forever. You know?

Go to hell. Chuckarumano. What a fucking disappointment he turned out to be. Yeah. Well, my wife, not so secretly fancies Chuckar and thinks that, you know, he he, you know, he could have been the salvation, you know, of of the country, let alone, the Labour Party.

You know? I think a lot of people used to feel that way, but it just goes to show the difference between perception and reality, doesn't it? I I think I think, it it's it's because, my wife thinks that, probably quite rightly, that, party what politics generally is about is about the good looking faces. You know? I was having this I was having this exact conversation last night with the chair of the Northampton South Labor Party, how it all goes back to, the Kennedy Nixon TV debate in about 1960.

Yeah. And the fact that it was it became a sort of truism of American politics that Kennedy won that election because he was younger and better looking. I have in the past argued that this is conceivably why The US was so opposed to people like Che Guevara and Gaddafi because they were better looking than any American politician. I know it sounds ridiculous, but you've gotta see it from their kind of infantile mindset. You know?

Yes. And and it goes back to the, you know, never trust them politician in a beard. You know? Yeah. Well I think Blunkett Blunkett had sort of similar issues.

Pogonophobia. Walt Disney had that. Didn't like Jews much either. Jews with beards. God.

Bloody hell. Run, rabbi, run. Rabbi, run. Run, run. Here comes Walt with a whole bunch of his flunkies.

Yeah. No. I people with beards. I don't think beards are very cool. When that current fashion for, like, very sort of, like, meticulously sculpted beards started to develop.

Obviously, these things start in London. And I was doing a gig one night in a place called the Betsy Trotwood in Clerkenwell, which is quite a cool little pub. In fact, they were so cool that when I walked in to get a pint, I looked at the chap behind the bar. I all I could conclude was that he was getting ready to join captain Scott on his trip walking across the Antarctic in a stout pair of brogues and plus fours. You know?

And he got this ridiculous bushy red beard and the rest of it, and our eyes met. And I couldn't help it. I laughed in his face A polo nose at all? Then? No.

No. No. Much more elaborate than that. I think there was a crew at involved. Honestly, gen gentleman Jim explores the Antarctic.

And even though he's, like, 24, I just laughed in his face, poor lad. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. I've got a great picture of, Henry Hudson, which and I I think I must have looked him up because, I quite like the Nico song. I think she must have written a song about Henry Hudson. Uh-huh.

Frozen wastes. And, and I've got a sort of little engraving of of Henry on on its last voyage with a with a young with a cabin boy at his feet. Good. The raw guy. But, yeah, he has a great beard.

Yep. Yep. So I I can understand polar explorers having beards. I mean, you know, you might lose your scuff. It might blow away.

So, Southern Mark Smith, August '84, Leamington Spa, Woodbine or Woodbine Studio, at least. Woodbine. Yeah. We went to Woodbine. And John A Rivers.

Yeah. We went to Woodbine for the we'd heard, the Jacobites record had been done there. You know, the one with Kings and Queens and Big Store and all that. And, we loved that. And also Dave J, he'd been doing his Crocodile album more or less sort of he doesn't record like us.

We we we tend to get a bunch of songs together, steam into the studio for two or three weeks, and make the record. Dave tends to have one or two songs, and he'll pop in one studio and record them. And then he'll have a couple more, and he'll go to another studio and record them over a long period. So Crocodile Tears was kinda getting made in the time that he was joining the band in that. You know?

And he did a song on Crocodile Tears called Slip the Rope, which, again, was recorded at Woodbine and, again, just had this fantastic, massive acoustic guitar sound. Yes. Quite, sounds a little like, an ocean. You know? It's a Yes.

Yeah. No. No. Tidal. Exactly that.

Yeah. Which, Which, of course, is exactly what Dave was looking for. And, when the reissues come out, there was a one of the reviews mentioned John Rivers, and it said, John Rivers, whose chief skill in the early eighties appeared to be taking garage bands and making them sound like they're playing in a canyon. Well, we wanted to be in a canyon. And, of course, the funny thing is with John, on that record, it's quite clean and tight.

It's not canyony at all. And indeed, when he did go canyony on us on Distressed Gentlefolk, none of us liked it because he was using brand new very early digital reverbs instead of proper warm analog reverbs, and we didn't like it. Especially me, I didn't like it. But it was my own fault because I was going, ah, slander everything in reverb. And it's like, oh, but your reverb sounds like shit, mate.

No. Not quite shit, but you know what I mean. But yeah. And, of course, he did Felt as well. And, again, made them sound like they were playing in a canyon.

And he had also recorded Ghost Town by the Specials. And he was insanely expensive by our standards at the time. I don't know how we got it together. And, indeed, over the over our association with John Rivers, there was a lot of sitting around listening to John complaining about how Dave Barker or Alan McGee hadn't paid him yet. Yeah.

John's quite a tidy person, and he likes things sorted out, eyes dotted, t's crossed. Where's my money? And he wasn't shy of tell letting the band hear how he felt about that even though, of course, we had no control of the situation whatsoever. So it's quite actually his least endearing trait probably, but most studio engineers will have a whinge about their unpaid bills at some point. And that and but the the this feeling that you're with a, you know, a professional, or you you may maybe had, you know, you were in a different sort of echelon of of, techies.

Well, it was it was made made you feel that the need to rerecord Smith, Mark Smith and Marnie and Well, the Southern Mark Smith had mutated right at the beginning of the process that led to scandal. You remember I talked about that gig in September, the CND one in the park? That was the first time that version of Southern Mark Smith got played, and we immediately preferred it to the boom boom boom version that we put out because it sounded a bit like Slip the Rope or Sudden and Cussworth. It was much more that way. And you know the funny thing?

I love Suicide, the band. And when Alan Vega died, I put a little thing on the Facebook. I said, like, I know it doesn't show in our music, but you're a fucking inspiration to me, bruv. And, actually, that whole version of Southern Mark Smith begins with us listening to, Cherie Cherie by suicide, which is the same chords. It's a Wild Thing again.

And whether Rolo came up with it as a suggestion or which would seem most characteristic or whether Max came up with it by himself, which is not impossible, we arrived at a situation where instead of playing the guitar with a pick with his fingers, Eider was bashing it with a pencil. And at the gig in the park, he did that. I played sort of regular strumming acoustic guitar, and Roe was just bashing on his little imaginary drum kit. And that was the first time we did it, and we liked it. And when Max and I then went on to do those duo gigs through the end of '83, it was a sort of big thing in the set.

So then when the rhythm section joined, when Owen came in and Dave eventually took over on bass, it was, you know, it was there. And it was it was so different to the other version that we just wanted to record it. And we also thought that John would be the man to record it because he's good at making guitar sound all big and spacey. And It's a little organ piece that that you saw that you that you've, you've reintroduced live recently, haven't you? Brought an organ player in what sort of advice into the quintet?

Yeah. Nick Nick Nick Bandy from Leicester, he, he came in. And, yeah, he loved doing that. He was he was a fan of the band before we met him. So, like, he knew all that stuff, and he was just itching to do Smith just so he could go.

And, yeah, that that that that had a lot to do with it, actually. And, also, that simple Hammond intro was incalculably important to the band because when Scandal was done, Dave Barker sent somehow around the world to various people to see what could be found. And they landed in the office of an agency in Hamburg called Jojo Concerts, which is run by a fellow called Joachim Clouch. And his assistant was Tommy Weber. And Tommy took Scandal in the out of its sleeve, and he put it on the office record player.

And he said that as soon as the Hammond come in with a, he was shouting across the office, boss. And, basically, the two of them went nuts for it and brought us over to Hamburg to play a couple of nights where everybody else in Hamburg went nuts for it. And that basically got us into Germany and enabled us to become what we became all because of that Hammond intro. And that was all there simply because John had always been an organ player and had a Hammond lying around in the studio. You know?

I mean, that could so easily have been a guitar part or maybe even a glockenspiel. You know? But there was a Hammond there, so we did it on that, and it changed everything. Just that little intro. Extraordinary.

And it was Dave Barker's idea to call it big return because, obviously, the Hendrix slight return thing. You know? Dave just he loves to flirt with all that iconography, I suppose you'd say. You know? Marnie, is is that just a complete fantasy?

Or or Well, I Are there big cats somewhere in a Here's the thing. Suspense it somewhere. Here's the thing. I think this must have happened subliminally. I don't really remember thinking about it.

But Marnie is a Hitchcock film. Yeah. And the character of Marnie is played by Tippi Hedren. Yeah. Yeah.

Tippi Hedren, in the early eighties, opened a wildlife park full of lions and tigers. And this was sort of announced. And in fact, she made a film called Roar, r o a r, all about how much she loves lions and tigers. So I think this must have got into the old reptile back brain. And, you know, oh, Marnie's got a problem.

She wants to keep lying in her room. And, actually, she was. So although it sounds imaginary even to me, the truth is that once again, it's face it's pasting facts. But it's just sort of come come around the back way to It's it's Tippi. The birds.

There is is that another blonde that that Hitchcock was infatuated by? I think that's Tippi Hedren as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

They couple of years back, there was a spate of pictures and television programs about how beastly he was to her, weren't they? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's dead.

He can't answer back, can he? Real men from Leeds. Oh god. That section at the end where, like, every line is a different thing was an absolutely nightmare. Well, sometimes, when you because I'm I've dig dug out some of these old things.

I haven't played for a while doing this. And, and, yeah, it always always confuses me. You must have it written down. Well, no. This is the thing.

This is the thing. And those vocals on that end bit, it's not just, you know, we stood around the mic and sang it once. They doubled, then then we do a harmony, then we double that. So there was an awful lot of choir activity, several takes, building it up. And having got down probably I did the I'd have done the lead vocal first, I guess.

So I would have sung all these different variations. Right? And I would have that noted down. But when we went in to do the choirs, no one had written it down, and I'd kinda memorized what was coming next. And in order that everyone would know what was coming next, we worked out a bunch of little signals.

And I can't remember what all of them were, but there was real men from Mars. Right? Mackenzie had decided that the sim the signal for that as we were singing along, you know, would be to go. And I went, and everybody just collapsed in helpless mirth. And that was it.

We had the giggles from that point. So take after take after take after take. And nobody could do it without pissing themselves. It was murder. John Rivers is getting really annoyed with this.

It had to do with Mars and Venus. Well, that was probably, maybe after. Venus and Mars? Men are from no. Men are from Mars.

Oh. Women are from Venus. Probably the I don't book of the eighties or nineties. Yeah. I mean, if that if that was going on, it was going on subliminally.

I hadn't intended that. No. It's I was literally just slinging them out. You know, real men from, oh, Leeds. Oh, real men from Mars.

And not really thinking about it, which is why it was such a chore when we had to sort of double it and redouble it and redouble it. And, you know, every time the signals and as soon as that happened, everything just broke down again. Oh, it's hilarious. You've got Betty Page style freak fridge magnets even today. Oh, no.

That was a thing. That's my friend Victoria from Portland. And I'd never met her. She'd sort of become a Internet friend. And we played one time in Tokyo, and it turns out she's half Japanese.

And she was over there. So she came to the gig. And I had no idea what this girl looked like or anything like that. And we walked on stage in Antiknock in Tokyo. And right down the front, there was this, like, stunningly pretty girl with a really cool haircut.

And she was going, Pat, Pat, it's me. And I was like, bloody hell. And then she reached in her bag and just passed me these two objects. And I sort of didn't really pay much attention about it. It's sort of, well, what have we got here?

Are these chocolate bars? You know? And it turned out to be those fridge magnets. I'm thinking, really cute woman about half my age handing me dirty fridge magnets before we've played a note. Gonna be a good night.

But, yeah, the Betty Page song, what's that all about? It's about Eider, really, isn't it? It's all about just that marvelous little acoustic solo. That took a minute or two. He's not he's not quick in the studio.

Do you know Shakespeare in the Bible? Yes. That Owens. Yeah. Yeah.

And they and they have a song about the big wood when they're on tour with Dave J. And there's a line in that big wood don't come quick because Max don't know the meaning of hurry. And that's particularly true in the recording studio. It's worth it, though. Gwendoline.

Yeah. It was fucking cheap line, wasn't it? Like brewery and fury. I think I think that one's I think that one's legitimate. I passed a I passed a brewery or two in the last day or two, and I thought about fury.

Makes me it does make me kick off. I've got a mate who has trouble saying brewery. He says buery. And library what's he say? Libuary.

He's he's not an ignorant man by any stretch of the imagination. He just can't say brewery and library. Where is brewery? Yeah. Fib you fib No.

I can't even begin to guess. Australia retain the Ashes. Do they indeed? Well, you've kind of had your cricket surprise for the summer already, haven't you, in that first game? I Need Meat.

Easter 1983. I reckon that was out on the town. It's a really important week weekend, actually. It's it's, the one in Big Saturday as well. Easter weekend of '83.

I found myself alone in the flat in Birchfield Road and just at large. And I didn't really know the town well or the people. And, I just had this really, really strange evening with, like, really attractive, really flirty young women, none of whom I took home. But it's it's, you know, it's it's as close to a straight up late fifties, early sixties sex frustration song as you're gonna get to. But using the butcher cover just put it that way.

You know, it's like where's the beef, really? It's like, come on, ladies. It's a bit it's a bit throwaway. I liked the bassline. And then, of course, Dave did the bass solo on the record, which I think is really great.

Whip it on Dave. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's a he's a deviant glider. He's very, very clever in the studio.

He brought a lot to that session. It's like on Soul Happy Hour, just at the corner before whiskey vodka special brew. Just on the d chord, he said, oh, I just wanna pop in and do something. And, like, you know, we were young and didn't know much about recording. It's like, really?

Really? Shouldn't we get on? No. No. It won't be a minute.

I'll just go alright then. And he goes in, and he takes an electric guitar, and he gets hold of a little tinny amp, and he just puts it on Maso Distorto. And just as the d part goes around at the end of Eider's little guitar solo, he just goes and, like, Rivers is in there and me and Max and and then we're all just gonna, like, really? But, actually, you hear it just as it comes back in. It's absolutely perfect.

Well, what Dave could do in recording studio, we couldn't at that point, was see the future. You know? He could see how this was gonna slot in. We were too young and dumb to know that. Give you an idea of how much learning we did on that Scandal session.

We went in I think one of the first things I think the first thing we tried to play was the Southern Mark Smith Big Return because we figured we knew it from live. You know? And, I can remember after a couple of takes John Rivers coming through on the talkback and saying, you, think it might be an idea if, like, the, the kick drum and the bass guitar played, like, together. Played the part together. And, like, they did.

And instantly, it all fell into shame. Instantly. And it's like absolutely book book one, page one, rule one. Put a kick drum and a bass guitar together. But we were actually into recording our second LP before anyone mentioned it.

You know? That was the level of learning. We went from being, like, ragamuffin to, like, half competent. Yeah. That's what makes it sound so tight, I think.

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the yeah. Dave's experience helped a lot, of course. And yeah.

Yeah. I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't a difficult session. It was really very fast. We did the rhythm tracks. We all played together.

Then we just kept the good drums and bass. And then Max and I would go in, and we'd do our guitars in the room together simultaneously. You know, I'd just play rhythm, and he'd play lead for the most part. Of course, Southern Mark Smith, that's that's like my first guitar solo at the end there. And I remember Eider going like, blimey.

But it it it was kind of funny because all I really need what I wanted to do is just go like the organ does. And I didn't really have anything else left. I didn't really have anything else to do, but the thing was going on to the fade out. And I was just sort of sitting there just going, and really just hanging on for dear life, not having any idea what I was doing after that initial phrase. You know?

But, yeah, that became my first guitar solo. But, yeah, we'd do that, and then then we'd do the singing and a bit of organ and glockenspieles and saxophones and the yellow plastic organ that I found in the street. I always imagined that Caroline Wheeler's birthday present was Willie. Is it is it not a song about Willie's Caroline Willie's birthday present? What?

Dicks? No. Certainly not. Alright. It's actually about a letter I received from a chap called Cameron Lindo, who was in a band called In Embrace who were also on Glass.

Oh. He still mates with Dave now. I have to see him now. And again, he comes to our gigs occasionally. And at the time, Cameron and I were pen pals, you know, stamps, envelopes, all that stuff.

And he had the most beautiful handwriting. He would write I mean, he must have looked like a crazy lady art teacher, but he wrote in green ink with this beautiful italic hand. He's a bit of an aesthete, Cameron. And he was going out with a girl called Caroline Wheeler who lived in Nottingham. And, he wrote me an installment in the sort of letter exchange.

I I got this letter. It was really quite a long letter. A lot of paper in there. And it turned out that most of this letter was detailing the things that he had bought for Caroline Wheeler's birthday. And, boy, there was a lot of stuff.

Shakespeare in the Bible on Ballad of the Big Wood. Owen sings, it was something used. It was something so big you could give it to Caroline Wheeler. So, basically, what I had, I had a backing track which I put together for Alice, and she'd done some unconscionable tweed drivel over the top of it, and I hated it. And I read this Caroline Wheeler letter, and I was just going, heaven's sake, Cam.

I mean, bloody hell, mate. This is this is the biggest pleading birthday. How big is this birthday present? And something possessed me. I think it had something to do with a couple of cans of special brew, and something possessed me to dig out the backing track cassette for this nonsense that Alice had committed before she split.

And partly out of contempt for the Alice song and partly out of outrage, Cameron's ridiculous letter about all these birthday presents, and partly out of just sheer special brew, I just embarked upon this heinous, heinous thing. Have you ever heard the original Caroline Wheeler's birthday present? I can't remember. Maybe. The the bedroom tape.

Yeah. I do I think I do have some old bedroom tapes, but it's been a while. It's on I'll tell you what. It's on the b side of the seven inch Armani, and that caused trouble in itself. But, yeah, it was it's basically just me, nasty drunk, snarling and shouting and carrying on into the cassette player.

And when we went to do it at Woodbine, it was a sort of question of, can we recreate something as malevolent as what was committed on the cassette? I think we did alright. But it was it was as close to a jam as anything on that album. Nobody really knew what the fuck was going on at any point. Must be my dirty mind then thinking.

Some are bigger than others. Yeah. I see what you mean. And this is what we have for Caroline. See what you're saying?

Actually, I I have a friend who who was a comedian, and I can remember a gig in 1991. And Caroline was there, and he was there. And he spent pretty much the whole night hitting on it. And I can remember at the end of the night issuing fourth from the club just in time to see Caroline Wheeler kicking him in the pool. It's a funny night, actually, because he he got a mild kicking off her.

And, I got a very severe kicking off a big Iranian bloke not long after. And then No. I was defending the honor of my recently my recently ex wife. It was a very, very, very frenetic evening. It'd get a chapter of its own if we were doing the biography.

Yeah. It's justice, but it's certainly not poetic, was the judgment of Piazza. And I read online about the Hell Driver's reference and, Yes. They must be doing 50. Yeah.

Yeah. I love that picture. Yeah. So that was David. Shit.

Here come the Hell Driver. Yeah. We had a lot of fun on that. Oh, and the Bruce Grobbeler Leisure Center Yeah. Which I guess doesn't exist, but it'd be nice if it did.

And and a bit of a throwback to, Bigfoot. They check-in to the Bruce Grobler Leisure Center. Well, yeah, people do check-in. I mean, look at Facebook. People are checking in all over the place these days.

But the Bruce Grobler Leisure Center was interesting because on a Tuesday night in about 1984, I suppose, I walked into my flat and absentmindedly turned on the radio just in time to hear John Peel say this. Well, I don't normally enjoy this band. Not really my thing. But I have to play this because, it mentions Bruce Grobbela. And on it came.

And as far as I'm aware, that is the only time that we got played by that fucking fraudulent, beautiful twat. Don't put that in the book. And what John Peel knew about music was absolutely fit on the end of a fucking biro. It was all John Walters. Are you ready?

The producer. He just, you know, he just told him what to play. Booked the bands for the sessions. And if you, you know, if you look at if you're as old as me, I can remember John Peel wittering on about fairies and unicorns and playing like Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks that would embarrass Mark Boland. You know?

And then I can remember him playing, like, Van de Graaff generator and King Crimson and Genesis and Mike Oldfield. He played the whole of Tubular Bells when it came out. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. And then suddenly, he loved the Ramones and the Undertones.

And then he really lost his way with post punk. And a lot a lot about early jazz butcher was fucking hell. I am so sick of hearing boring goth bands from Southampton playing six eight on the John Peel show. Everything. While some fucking bird from art college wails on about something or other.

But he really liked the Fall? Yeah. He really, really liked He did like the Fall. But, you know, even a stop clock is right twice a day. Right?

And nobody talks about it, you know, when all that when all that fuss was going off about, like, sex pests and Jimmy Savile and all that nonsense. Nobody talks about the fact that John Peel would routinely turn up at Reading Festival dressed in a gym slip and black stockings and a little schoolgirl hat and would rant endlessly about schoolgirls in his sounds column and on the radio. Nobody ever mentions it. Have you seen schoolgirls? I mean, what's sexy about that?

Seriously? I mean, have you seen them? I've been to both the John Peel graves. Yeah. You know, the, The real one and the DJ.

The real one and the DJ. Mhmm. And the real one is in Cumbria somewhere. Yes. I think I've seen that.

It's just a very elaborate, with, obviously, a sort of hunt scene on it. Yeah. And, and and the DJ's is in Suffolk. Yes. And there's there was a bottle of wine on it.

Says it all really, doesn't it? Suffolk. That well known rock and roll hot spot. You know, there's Chicago and Detroit and Memphis and Suffolk. Yeah.

Where Ed Sheeran's from. You know? That sort of rock and roll capital of the world as it is now. Yeah. You know, I'm really as we sit here talking, I'm beginning to feel the way that I used to feel in 1982.

War on everything. That was actually one of our slogans, war on everything. And we had to modify it after Mark e Smith was nice to us. We then we said war on everything except for the Fall. Yeah.

We were we were hostile. And part of the business of, like, putting jokes in the music and being lighthearted about it in many ways was actually a calculated act of aggression and resistance to all this, like, 22 year old singing about bones, you know? It it was something that doesn't get talked about very much, but just as apparently inconsequential songs like Love Kittens and Mind Like a Playgroup are actually about sort of like just an entire rejection of humanity. By the same token, a lot of the sort of comical asides and that, a lot of which were inspired by old soul records, you know, with talking on their on their records. Loved that.

And as I say, I still hadn't connected the Butcher with myself. I still thought he was like Solomon Berg or someone. You know? Mind like a play playgroup, I think, we should sort of talked about before. And, We did let's face it.

We we had that thing. We'd it happened a lot with John, actually, was if a song was of a certain type, we'd end up going a 110% down that road. So if it's a little bit country, you know, the next thing you know, some country was going yeehaw in the back end vocals or something. Or if it was a little bit reggie, then it had to sort of, like, go totally reggie, you know, that sort of thing. And, with that one, it went from a little bit wacky to what was referred to in the studio as wacky factor 10.

We knew what we were doing, and we were delighting in it. Pots and pans and Yeah. Yeah. There's the bloke who wrote Bela Lugosi's Dead on his knees in the studio with a wooden spoon and a couple of saucepans of water going splishy splishy splishy splishy. Max looked at Owen.

Owen looked at me. I looked at Owen. He looked at Max, and we all just went and then I when we did Wheeler, I had to top that. So I went upstairs to the kitchen, and I just removed John's cutlery drawer wholesale, took it down into the studio, mic'd it up and send this something. Like an idiot.

So, yeah, I mean, we were look. We were having a lot of fun doing it. And as I say, in a way, the fact that we were overtly having fun was a sort of rebuke to all these third division Sisters of Mercy that was starting to appear on the Peel show. You know? I mean, Susie and the Banshees, yeah.

Lincoln's version of Susie and the Banshees, not so much. Thanks. You know, that's that's where we were at. And does, Owen play, accordion on desert? That's not an accordion.

Oh, what is it? That is a yellow bondempi plastic organ about yay big that I literally found in the street. Oh, is this the yellow one? Yeah. Alright.

Okay. Yeah. But it Owen plays the little solo. That's him. But yeah.

No. I don't even know if he was playing accordion at that stage. I I don't quite know when he took that up. Maybe when he moved to Germany, I guess. I always think of, I I always think my dessert is waiting.

I don't know why I put an extra s in there, but not in my mind. I'm not quite sure what the connection is, but there is an old show tune. I'm not quite sure what it's from. Oh, it's from Kismet. You know the old musical Kismet?

Mhmm. Just playing with spiders. Eek. That could cause damage if it goes into my little, Oh, that's quite true. Yeah.

Socket. There he goes again. Look. Get out of it. My dad's like, yeah, Kismet was a musical.

My grandmother liked it, and there was a song in that. It was it was all a bit sort of, orientalist, you know, all mystical Arabic and all that. And there was a song in that where a geezer with a towel on his head would sing, my desert is waiting. Like this. And for some quite how that got into my head and connected with that, I don't know.

But it's it's another one of them Jug Band Blues jobs. It's it's another one of, like, look, mate. I'm not being funny. It is there, and it is waiting. You know?

Yeah. I I love my desert. We tried to play out live around about that time. Alan McGee had this club down in, West End, and it was primitive as you like. The first time we played it, he introduced me to Joe Foster.

He said, Pat, this is Joe. Joe's got the microphone. The microphone. You know? But I can remember trying to do a live version of that.

We took the yellow organ, and we tried to mic it up. And we had a glockenspiel as well. Tried to mic that up. And, of course, in a crowded pub full of little hipsters falling over and getting drunk, it was a complete waste of time. So we never really tried to play it out again for years.

And then when we were doing Masters of Budvar, I would do these odd supports. And, it was a time when I was doing a lot of computer music, so I used to just rush up backing tracks. And every set that I did at Budvar, basically, I focused on another jazz butcher album. And the one where we did Scandal, I thought partly because it was dead easy. I just programmed up, my desert.

And I don't remember much about those sets, but what I do remember was the night that I did that. As it started up, I just heard Mark Refoy down the front going, no way. Basically, it's moments like that that keep me going. No way. It's like that story about when Teenage Fan Club took Alex Chilton down the pub in Glasgow, and he said as he as he walked into the Hipster's bar, the cries of get your fuck could be heard at the other end of Socky Hall Street.

Which leaves, I think, another little perfect little pop song, Girlfriend Oh, yeah. Which I thought, had been done before by, by the other Elvis, girl of my best friend and all that. I never really listened to very much Elvis Costello. I really like that. What you mean Preseley?

Oh, The King. You should've said. I mean, The King. Yeah. Girl of My Best Friend.

Yeah. I don't I'm not really familiar with that song, to be honest. The inspiration for Girlfriend was a complete lift from a Lou Reed song called Billy, which I think is on it's possibly on Sally Can't Dance or one of the sort of mediocre lost lost period albums. And I think he's singing about Billy Name from the factory. And it is those chords, and he plays it in a kind of shuffle.

Like that. And he sings, Billy was a friend of mine. And I heard that, and I don't know what kind of mood I was in. I was in the Birchfield Road flat, and I just felt compelled to copy it because there were such pretty chords. Because, you know, I didn't know anything about sunroin in those days.

I was still stumbling across things that were obviously completely obvious to everybody else. But to me, they were like magic discoveries. You know? And, yeah, GDC. You done?

So I banged it out, and I I copied Lou. I played it in a in a shuffle style and wrote my own words and the little changes and so forth. And it was only when Eider got hold of it. It's almost like he misunderstood what was on the cassette. He must have thought I was trying to play it in a four four, and he just put it into the sort of, you know, the pop beat, the Beatle beat.

And then he wrote that that intro for it. And, just for doing those two things, I gave him half the songwriting credits because it was so important to what what happened with the song. I didn't like it going four four at the time. In fact, this is on the, the notes to the box set. But as we were listening to the take of Girlfriend, probably like the rhythm take, I was listening to it, and it's sort of zipping by real fast with this pop beat.

And I became irate. What I'd seen as a sort of down late night kind of a song had turned into this sort of shiny pop thing. And I started muttering things about sort of, like, stultifying competence and Dire Straits and CDs and things like that. And eventually, I had to remove myself from the studio and spent that particular Thursday afternoon downtown in a pub in Lemmington just getting more and more bitter and twisted drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking through the afternoon. Oh, cunts.

CUn ts. Because what I saw there was the thing that we talked about with La Mer. What I saw was, like, the sort of outsider nature of the music was being reined in and professionalized and made competent and therefore neutered. And I was really cross about it. And then, of course, when it come out, everybody liked it.

And then to my absolute delight, one of the London fanzines, I think it was jamming, did a really good review of the album and described the song as being like an amphetamine Dire Straits. I was like, yeah. You see? I told you. I told you.

But what I hadn't anticipated was that everyone was gonna like it quite so much. Yeah. I get the last thing I was gonna mention that you read about scandal is that you wrote somewhere that it sold 25,000 copies. And Or more. Yeah.

Yeah. And I and I don't know whether, because I think it was the first Jazz Butcher album I bought. People discovered you through the Dave J connection Totally. Yeah. All that.

You know? And that's what really helped it. And the fact that it was the first it was it was a big production, you know, in the in the way that the first album wasn't a big production. No. That's right.

That's right. No. I mean, the first album was really sort of perceived as a kind of post punk sort of ramshackle thing, quite rightly. Whereas this, we'd sort of accidentally become, yeah, a bit more of a unit. And John, you know, he pulls things together, doesn't he?

So I don't know. Yeah. An albatross. A bit of an albatross, you felt? Little bit.

Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean, there was no question that when you did a gig, the little three chord pop songs like Rain and Girlfriend went down a treat, especially with the old Germans. And it was kind of fun to do initially, but it wasn't really where I'd hoped to end up. It wasn't what I'd envisaged myself doing.

Though, I mean, live, there was still a certain sort of ramshackle, Velvety element to it, so that was kinda cool. We were definitely better. Better value live, I think. And someone even drew drew a drew a cartoon for the front cover. Don't think it's out here, is it?

Oh, it is. Yeah. Hunt Emerson? Yeah. Yeah.

He's out of Birmingham. He's he's been doing it for years and years and years. And in fact, even in '84, the reason we were inspired to get on to him was, in the control room, because there's a lot of sitting about when you're making records, Dave had brought the big book of Hunt Emerson, which he just published. It was a big old compendium of lots of stuff that he'd done over the years, and we all loved it. We, you know, we all had a read of it over the course of the fortnight, and, we all loved it.

And somebody said, well, why don't we get Hunt Emerson to do the sleeve? And we were all, well, come on. He's got a blooming book out. He's real. Who the fuck are we?

Never happen. Dave Barker, on the other hand, being a clubbable fellow and not one who's easily put off, found Hunt Emerson, phoned him up, said, do you want me to cover for this band? And Hunt went, £150? And David, mhmm. Done deal.

And so there it was. And it was as it was as easy as that. You know, it's we wanted it. We didn't think we could have it, and then we had it. Is he the same guy that did, the cover for The Ducks?

Was that Hunt? No. That's, Edwin Pouncey, savage savage pencil he calls himself. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now you'll see Hunt's stuff in, Fortean Times every month.

He's pretty much their house cartoonist these days. But he does he does fill the loads. Still around. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Very much so. Very much so. Yeah. And that's one thing that Dave and I kind of bonded over was comics in general. And, like, you know, he was mates with Alan and so forth.

So that may have been the first night I ever met Dave, actually, was at at, this birthday party, Kevin's birthday party on a boat, on a canal boat. And the Sinister Ducks performed. Alan, Dave, and Alex, they got up the end of the boat, and they did their two songs. They did their repertoire. And, yeah, I think that's that's certainly the night I met Alan.

And that was funny because Alan's first published ship was a thing called The Adventures of Saint Pancras panda, which came out in a little Oxford underground comic called The Backstreet Bugle. And, you know, little underground paper for the town. And Alan had this thing about some pancreas panda and I loved it. I absolutely loved this cartoon. Because by the time I'd met him, he'd done loads of stuff for 2000 AD, and he'd done Swamp Thing.

I'm like, he'd certainly done V for Vendetta because David made the record with him. Yeah. And so he was he was quite a known bloke. But as our hands shook and we looked into each other's eyes, I was like, you're the bloke who did Saint Pancras panda. Brilliant.

I may be the only person who's ever said that to him. Yeah. Yes. That may well have been the day day that I first really got to talk to Dave properly as well. Again, Summer '83, that was.

And Kevin's quite a little catalyst in his own way, isn't he? Since the thread is there. And, of course, as it moves on, where did we practice up the songs for Sex and Travel? In Kevin's living room. Oh, yeah.

I read that as well. Yeah. Yeah. This is before they thought we need to go somewhere where the sun shines more. I'm not quite sure what persuaded him to move to America altogether.

Can't really remember. I think it was just the fact that Love and Rockets Took off a bit. Yeah. Pretty much from the word go. They they were successful over there.

So I think it just made sense for them to be on-site as it were. You know? Wow. That's a long one. But,

		The late Pat Fish in conversation with me on 5th October 2019.
		<p />Much of this would become the &apos;Fishcotheque&apos; chapter of &apos;Miracles and Wonders&apos;, the book Pat and I wrote, which I finished and published after he shuffled off on 5th October 2021.  
		<p />
		It was a lovely, if emotional day.  We ate bagels and smoked cheese at my house, watched the Tottenham game (they lost 3-0 to Brighton), aborted an intended trip to Uppingham, before arriving at the Plough, Shutlanger. 
		<p />After the recording we went on a little pub crawl, witnessed a skein of geese fly noisily overhead (&quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen that before&quot;, said Pat), and consumed a takeaway back at Fishy Mansions.

Testing. Testing. Hola. Hola. We're for forums.

Yeah. Yeah. All good. Yeah. So I'm The ram.

The ram. The goat. The goat. Yeah. It wasn't uncle Dave's goat.

It was uncle Dave's pub at the time. He had this place, and, uncle Dave, like me, he likes a bit of spliff. And he had a quarter lying around his flat upstairs at the pub. And he must have grabbed it and put it down in the wrong place. But this goat that was residing temporarily here in this yard ate the quarter.

Dave, of course, was furious with the goat, but he did he you know, before he could get around to organizing any kind of chastisement for the goat, The goat freaked out having eaten a quarter of hash and started butting the wall of that shed repeatedly. And Dave decided, well, it's beating itself up. I don't need to take any further action. So today, we are going to bridge eighty six to eighty eight tour. Whilst we're in this pub, we have to talk about living in a village.

Kit. But, we also need to talk about because we didn't we didn't touch on the first US and Canadian gigs of '86. No. I mean, that was an interesting time. One of the last gigs we did before America was a massive, massive thing in Naples.

It was the Italian young communist's national knees up. And I don't know if you're familiar with the Bay Of Naples, but on the Bay Of Naples is an enormous seafront. And that was absolutely heaving with people. There are, I would say, at least 20,000 people now. And, we had to go and play at this lot.

And it went very well. It was a lovely evening. But at some point in the evening, I was being interviewed by this, keen young Italian socialist, and he goes, and and when is your next where is your next concert? And I found myself compelled to tell him that it was in New Jersey. I felt like a right klutz.

Yeah. It was it was mad because that was the '86, of course. And right out on the horizon at the edge of the bay, you could see the bloody great American warship from which the planes were taking off to murder children in Libya. And how did you feel when your first week was here in America? Well, you know, we were all good good little Eurocommists as our Italian adventure rather suggests, and our initial reaction on landing in America was to do a lot of bristling.

But we landed in New York, which made it kinda easier because, of course, you know, you get that drive in from JFK, and you sit there looking at it, and you go, New York City just like I pictured it. And you get to do all that. And, of course, you know, it's like Velvet Underground City and Yeah. Greenwich Village City. So, like, you're kind of cool.

You're kind of interested. And the very first night that we were there, of all the things to be happening around the corner, Rolo's mob were playing. So we went to see them and hung out with them. Remember coming back about four, five in the morning, heading for the hotel. We got me, Rolo, and Frank.

He's bass player, Frank de Freres. And, there's a dude sort of lurking in a in a dark dark sort of corner going, hey. Hey, bro. Bro, that guy, what you need? Giving all this out.

And Frank, being Frank from this terribly sort of well brought up artistic family, Frank goes toddling over. Say, really? What do you do? And we're going, Francis. It's, yeah.

It so there was that. And then the first gig we did was in a place called Maxwell's in Hoboken, which is just over the water, so it's New Jersey. And then the next gig we did was in a place called the Cat Club on the Lower East Side. Oh, yes. So we have your picture taken with you, Your guitar's over your shoulder.

That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alastair and Robin had come from the Sound Sky.

They'd come out to see some gigs out on the East Coast. And, yeah, the Cat Club was, like, at one end of the street, and at the other end of street, there was a theater where Lou Reed was playing the same night. So the fact that anyone turned up was kind of a delight to us. And when we ended up doing sweet Jane for an encore, knowing that he was probably doing exactly the same thing 300 yards up the street, that was quite a buzz. So the crowds were quite decent then?

Well, we I mean, it doesn't take a lot to sell out Maxwell's. It's not that big a place. Couple of 100. You know? But when we hit New York, it was in the middle of this thing called CMJ conference.

And this is basically every last alternative music twat in the nation descends upon New York City. So it was impossible to move around the cat club without someone leaping in your way and going, hi. I'm Jodie from Colorado. Can you give me a station ID? I'm sorry.

A station what? What do you want? Do you want my ticket? You know? You have to say KXPW Colorado with the alternative sound.

I have to say what? And, you know, by the time we've got that far into the conversation, there's three others going, hey. Hey. Hey. I'm Joanie from XPWQ.

And it just never stops. It was it was impossible to move around. Fortunately, we ran into some girls that we knew from New York who'd met us in London, and they kind of became our small, snappy protectors. One of whom I later married briefly. And, yeah.

So it was it was a mad start, and it took us two or three days to get our heads around it at all. We couldn't understand why there was only Heineken to drink and things like that. And, I can remember we got as far as Boston, Massachusetts, and, oh god. The Cape Cod incident. We're gonna have to do the I mean, I don't know.

Look. I mean, what are we doing here? We're not doing a biography, are we? We're trying to do the work rather. Yeah.

Nonetheless, I do feel I should tell the Cape Cod incident. If it's useful connecting material. I don't know. I don't know. It's just cultural context, I suppose.

But we had a day off just before Boston, Massachusetts. And there's a fellow called Eric Lindgren, who's on the music scene out that way, who Dave Barkanew. And, Eric had arranged for us to stay. I think it must have been his grandmother's house rather than just his mom. Given the age we were, it must have been his grandma.

This old lady right out on Cape Cod with a house, like, 20 yards from the sea. Just, you know, no fences or anything. Just a house by the road, a porch, a beach. I mean, we got to this place not knowing what was going on and being very sort of sweetly eyed and suspicious. And, we were greeted by missus Lindgren with incredible hospitality and kindness.

She let us sit there in our house and smoke dope and drink beer. And the Avengers was on TV, and we were happy and not sad. The next morning, we awoke. It was a beautiful summer stay on Cape Cod down by the beach. Owen and I went into the kitchen, and there was old grandma Lindgren.

And from the freezer, she pulls an enormous lobster. We pay this no mind. We figure that this thing, you know, it's just a lobster from the fridge. What she then does is she puts it in the sink and starts running water on it. And to our utter horror, the thing starts to move.

But it can't do too much moving because its claws have been taped shut. And it's a big old thing, and it's waking up, and we're sort of just being quietly horrified. And she goes, here's my birthday lunch. And like this old lady, she's gotta be, like, 82 if she's a date, right, and it's her birthday. Here's my birthday lunch.

I reckon he could be 25 years old. 25 years old. You gotta understand as we drove out to this place, every 100 yards, there's a lobster shack. This place is lobster Auschwitz. Just a constant lobster holocaust going on.

Right? And somehow, this wily old so and so has managed to reach the age of 25 years old only to be caught by grandma Lindgren and queued up for lunch. So she goes pottering off. Lobster sits there twitching in the old sink. And Owen and I are mortified.

And we go running out onto the front porch where Max is sitting with the journalist guys. And we report the situation, and everyone's feeling very, very uncomfortable. And, of course, we start working out. It's like, you know, all you've gotta do she's an old lady. All you've gotta do is pick him up and run 20 yards to the beach and let him go.

That's all we've gotta do. But she's been so nice to us, and it's her birthday lunch. What are we gonna do? What's the contract? Mental anguish.

In the end, we left him to his fate. We thought, well, she better have her lunch. And, jumping over the eighty six tour of The US and Canada fairly quickly because we're gonna move on to the Well, we killed it. We killed it. We had no we had no idea.

I mean, you know, three months before we went, we'd never dreamed we'd be playing America. We got there, and this CMJ thing was on. And CMJ was one of three alternative charts they used to have. And on that, we were number two behind Sonic Youth. On another chart at the same time, of the same type, we were number two behind The Ramones.

And no one had told us the damn thing. So we walked into this kind of, you know, there were just kids everywhere. Loads of the gigs sold out. Lots of radio radio played by then. You know?

College radio play. Lot of college radio play. Tiny bit of commercial as well. And then it got worse. Then we got into Canada, and no one had told us, but we were on a major label.

And so the Mercury machine went into effect, which meant that I was handed sheets of paper that began with the words nine and AM, you know, so I could sit in my hotel bed and talk to the Winnipeg supergrass or whatever. That was pretty dire. And you've told us a bit about Canada before. Maybe later tours where, where, you know, the the guitar case incident what's in the guitar case? Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

The, yes. The great airport event. Yeah. That was enough. Which was probably a tour or two late.

Yeah. And then Two or three tours later, I think. And then back to back to Europe continuing to gig. In '86, you played over a 100, I think. Yeah.

I mean, the big thing that happened between America and Europe was that we, we finally sort of shared Graham. There was a moment in the middle of the American tour in Detroit where Owen and I were sitting, some hotel somewhere, and we're talking about the state of Graham. And Owen said, you know, I feel I know him less well now than when he joined the band. And, yeah, the guy just had some really weird coping strategies for touring. You told us about bathrooms.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was the the that, you know, that actually becomes a genuine practical nightmare when you're living on the road.

And I I probably told you about Ida's sardian moment where he decided that the way he would express this was by moving him to Graham. So by the end of the tour, we were pretty much Max, Noane, and I pretty much resolved that, you know, Graham needed something needed to be done. And in fact, in the last desperate days in LA while we were piling around being hostile to everything that came near us, Graham came shuffling up to me and said, I think I think I'm going to leave the group. And I thought, oh, well, saves me a job then. Because I wasn't looking for I'd you know, I'd They had a slight inkling by then.

I'm not into the business of sacking people. No. No. No. No.

No. I mean, give you some idea, right, of how out of touch Graham is with reality. Many, many, many, many, many years later, I bumped into him in the road mender. It's probably about 2000 and something. And he says to me, Pat.

I said, Graham. He said, Pat, sex and travel, the album title. Yes, Graham. Yes. That's like sex and travel.

It's like, fuck off, isn't it? Yes, Graham. So like the penny dropped. Okay. Yeah.

And then he goes on to say, so, like, you were, like, telling Dave Jade to fuck off. Subject places, palm, over face, and acts as though he's lost the will to live. Yeah. Unbelievable. So you're, like, telling Dave to fuck off then?

Just no connection with the facts at all. He's probably voting for Boris Johnson there. And then, I wonder, at some point during autumn eighty six, Max disappears for fourteen years. Oh, good. Oh, good.

But we we haven't we haven't got to that yet. We haven't even replaced Graham yet. And that's the real problem. Yes. In the in the methodology of it, things started to go wrong in the dressing room.

Graham went. We didn't quite know what to do about that. We didn't know who to get, but we knew we got a whopping great big, European tour coming. Alex Green had returned from living in Sweden, so we took him on to play sax. And in the end, we decided to go for a bloke who Max probably knew best.

We all knew him a little bit from Oxford. A guy called Richard Lawn, who was really a guitar player, but he could play a bit of bass. So we got him in. And he was a disruptive influence in the dressing room. He's very and he's tremendously able guy, tremendously good player, but he had that sort of upper middle class confidence and self assurance that can really grate when you're all trying to pull together.

And, yeah, he he just used to drive me to levels of irritation. And I think Max got irritated at my being irritated. We weren't particularly irritated with each other. But, by then, he was working up he used to sit he used to work on, that song My Other Life and a couple of the other earlier solo album songs. He was his head was there already on that autumn tour.

He was like he got the chance to do the solo record, and he was really starting to think about it. And I really needed him more to be there for me so that I could deal with these two new recruits. One of him wasn't really any trouble at all, bless. You know, Alex. I mean, he's he's he was made to be in that band for a while.

That's, the Richard question. Yeah. Yeah. He annoyed me. And, really, all that famous blow up with me and Max that everyone talks about, which wasn't really that big a deal, It was, as far as I remember it, all the animosity that evening really started stemming from the activities of Richard the night before.

But, I mean, this isn't this isn't on the record stuff, really. No. K. So but it wasn't some Gallagher Brothers violent buster? We sat there the next morning.

Him and me, we'd be we sort of went off to have a little fucking conference. You know? And we sat in this bar in Switzerland together. And it's like, so are you off then? Yeah.

I'm gonna get the train back. Alrighty. You'll be alright. Yeah. I know.

Yeah. Stupid. Yeah. And then he goes, well, at least it didn't turn violent. I went, yeah.

And we dropped him at the railway station, and we set off, and everyone was a little bit in shock. At least it didn't turn violent. That's when I remembered the table. The table with about a 130 glasses and bottles on it being thrown at me. But we don't like to talk about it in for the public because they just scurrilous.

But I have in my investigations, you can see it on the encyclopedic abc.com. Yeah. Zurich 11/27/1986. Yeah. Oh.

Is that Yeah. The next gig, Schaffhausen, November 28. Mhmm. He's absent. He's just gone.

Yeah. He's just gone. Yeah. He got he got on the train. You're playing the gig the next night without without guitar.

Yeah. Fortunately, we had Alex. And, fortunately, by then, I'd learned to play guitar a little bit. So, I've actually I certainly had a bootleg of a gig in Vienna a couple of nights after the boy went. We're we're sounding great.

I mean, there was a a shift in the sound. It wasn't quite so hard, but it was, yeah, it was alright. And we went on. We did Austria and a bunch of Italian dates and then a couple of German dates, and then we came home. And then almost about two days later, we were straight out to Spain.

And, then I got a flu. Is this the year you end up in New York in a basement before you're then called out for the eighty seven tour with Alex? Well, that's right. Went home for Christmas. Obviously, I had quite a fair bit of money in my pocket at that point.

And, so I thought I'll go and see that girl in New York, which I duly did. So I was just sitting in a basement in Queens passing the time, and Mike Inc phones me up and goes, you know you're supposed to be in Norway in four days, don't you? I'm like, no. You know I've got no band, don't you? No.

So, yeah, Alex and I just set off and played those dates. Just the two of us. And then, well, what happened on that string of dates, of course, was that we got as far as Paris. And that was the night that they made us sing La Mer over and over and over again. Yeah.

You must know. Yeah. And came off, came up the stairs into the dressing room, and there was McGee. Then I've gone to sign you. I was like, you what?

Your contract's up with glass. I hadn't even noticed. What's when when was this? What's the date? It would've been February.

So he's chasing you? Who's chasing me? McGee. Can I help you? To a degree, it's after you.

Yeah. Yeah. He said a very flattering thing. He said he wanted, he'd always wanted three artists for the label. One was, Lawrence at Felt, one was Julian Cope, and one was me.

And he said, well, two out of three ain't bad. But, you know, if ever if ever proof was required that Alan Magee just spends his time pursuing nutters and sociopaths, I mean, it's right there, isn't it? And then you sort of have to start to assemble a band, but you're still playing gigs. And and gig, Kizzy, I think, turns up first gig. Kizz turns up straight away because, like, he used to In the '87, I spotted the the first gig.

I thought he appears in Sheffield Uni. Oh, was that Super Cosmic Joy? These were organized by two geezers, one called Zig and one called Horton Jupiter. These days, Horton Jupiter is, sort of anarchist chef and DJ in South London. And Zig is Mark Webber, the other guitar player in Pulp.

In those days, they were both about 16. They had sort of weird matching off art anoraks. And they used to organize these gigs. They'd phone up Sonic, and they go, Sonic, Sonic, Jason says you're gonna play our gig. And then very quickly, they'd phone up Jason and go, Jason, Jason, Sonic says you're gonna play our gig.

Then they'd phoned me up and say, Pat, Pat, Spaceman three are doing this gig. And cheeky little songs, they weren't even old enough to get into their own promotions. You know? But they used to, like, play us off against each other. And next thing you know, they've got, like, half a dozen bands assembled.

That's where I first ran into Inspiral Carpets. They were always on first at these things. Funny little band from Rochdale. You know? Him him with the hair, we used to call it.

So, you know, I've probably actually spent time around Noel Gallagher to at that point when he was rode in for him, of course, but didn't know it at the time. They're just back in Northern Monkees. And, yeah, that very first gig with me at Sheffield, it was just me and KISS, and we went on and we started with the song, and playing away. And, this is a bit where KISS gets to have a bit of a guitar solo, and it was the strangest sounding thing. It was like there was like there was like some kind of limiter on the guitar or something really strange.

There was no sustain on it at all. And we got to the end of the first number, and he realized he'd been playing the guitar with the plectrum stuck in between the strings to wait, you know, like, where you put them just to keep them there. And, yeah, the silly sort of just picked up the guitar and started playing it with the pick still wedged under the strings. The start of an illustrious career. And, and O'Keefe and Maureen sort of arrived by the '87?

Yeah. Lawrence arrived initially. We answered an ad in the Melody Maker, a sort of stupid surrealist box ad for a rhythm section. Mhmm. And Lawrence arrived with a fellow called Budge who had, like, this incredibly expensive smart car and was really sort of, like, rugged type.

Righty ho. Yes. Let's play the drums. And he was quite a nice chap, but he was like, he clearly had far too good a job to be able to join a professional rock and roll band. You know?

It was just obvious from the car and everything. So he lasted fucking five minutes really. Poor old Budge. And then yeah. Yes.

Then would be Mulraney. And he was recommended by Alan and Dick, Dick Green. And I'd I remember Paul's told me since that Dick used to bang on at him. Oh, you're gonna love them. You're gonna love them.

They got a song about chicken. They're mental. And Paul's like, oh, I don't know about all this. But pretty much from day one, it was clear that Mulraney and me were gonna get on. Yeah.

What a geyser. What a man. Were there sort of terms to the creation signing, or is it a gentleman's handshake? Was that proper legal stuff? What's the paperwork going on?

Expectations. I think I mean, possibly part of a new order, But I think I probably had the last handshake deal in history. Because round about '92 when Sony got involved, suddenly everyone went around, and everyone was being forced to sign new contracts, you know, for Sony's sake. And, I remember the scream wriggling like mad. They didn't they didn't wanna do that because they'd always been on a handshake as well.

But, of course, they were worth too much money, so they got nailed to a contract of some kind. But somehow, I think simply by just not being around, I never got to sign any paper, which meant, of course, that when creation fell over, there was really nothing to stop me claiming all that back catalog, which, of course, I have now done and sold it to fire for money. So, you know, that was always that was always a great a great thing for me was that there's no paperwork, no paper trail on any of that. It's just you know? And all those records, it's not like I'm robbing anyone.

All those records made their money back and the rest. So, you know, they are just mine. And the, the lapse from blocks was there. It was Dave. Is there a sort of forced separation from No.

I wasn't crazy about it, but, I mean, I obviously, I went and talked after my gear turned up and after I got back from tour, obviously, I went and talked to Dave about this. But from where I was sitting, it looked like creation was gonna be a much better deal just in terms of, like, getting attention and credibility. The interesting You've been lifted, Jamie Vardy liked, haven't you all? Was there a sense of that? Sort of rise rising a division or two?

What was it? That was that was that was how we perceived it from where we were, but gotta bear in mind that we live in England. And what what became apparent quite quickly was that although Dave Barker was just a bloke with a telephone, he was actually much better at foreign markets than creation were. Yeah. They look like pop stars to us because they're always in the English press.

But in terms of actually doing things on the ground in foreign countries, they weren't actually that well equipped to do that. Again, there was only a couple of them. You know, I mean, the when I signed, there was Alan and Dick. And after a while, there was Ed Ball. And Jeff Barrett would help out with the press, and Emma would help him.

Emma, who ended up in Lush, Emma Anderson. But that was it. That was the entire staff of the operation. And, like, really, there were only three or three full ones, Alan, Dick, and Ed. Cue loads of juvenile jokes.

Matt, Alan, Dick, Ed. And then we get into '88 and, and recording fish fish kitec. I'm not sure what, what month. Well, fish kitec was done over the '87. Oh, was it?

Yeah. You see, we didn't we didn't have the rhythm section at that point. We didn't get Mulraney until December '87. I can remember the rehearsal stand in Greenwich. When I see these guys on the on the credits, Greenwood Goulding and Dave Moore Yeah.

The Weather Prophets. Weather Prophets Rhythm section. We were thrilled to get them. There was a lot of doubt about that because there's a lot of maneuvering going on. Alan had come up with this sort of weird crossover label called Elevation.

He did a single for Edwin Collins on it, and it was his plan to put The Scream on it and The Weather Prophets. And the idea was that this would kind of bridge between creation and the majors. I think there was major money behind it. It was one of these proto fake indie labels. You know?

But it all went tits up. It didn't really work. The Edwin Collins record stiffed. The weather profits stiffed. And you see, as long as the as long as the profits were on this elevation label I think there's Warners who were involved or someone like that.

As long as they were on this label, we couldn't say who they were. We could use them on the record, but they had to be secret. We were gonna credit them as Bang and Olafsson, as a matter of fact. But by the time the record was done and cut and mastered, the whole elevation thing had collapsed and fallen through. And so we can actually call them by their names, which was nice because they're lovely blokes and lovely players.

So, yeah, we made the majority of the record with them. Lawrence is on one track, and there's a couple of other chaps who played for about ten minutes in the '87. They're on Lot 49. It's quite good for them, actually, because, like, that's about the only thing they got recorded with us. And, it's actually been one of the more popular songs, so they can sort of feel they there was some point getting involved.

You know? And, tell me about Alaska Studios, Waterloo. Alaska. Before we get into the song. Yeah.

Well, Alaska is the studio of Pat Collier, who was in the vibrators. And there's rehearsal rooms and a couple of recording studios. It's under the arches down by Waterloo, as you probably know. It's funky. It's down and dirty.

And after Distress, it felt like the perfect place to go and make the record that I actually wanted to make that had some sort of, like, you know, a bit of amplifier noise on it. Bit of fucking. And so yeah. And it was cheap. And it came with O'Higgins.

You know, we just walked in, and there he was, sitting there looking like Bob Geldof eating his vegans, whatever that stuff is. He just always had this enormous Tupperware bowl of just, like, salad weird salad y stuff. Fruit falafel, aren't they? In which he'd scoop up by the handful while he was working. Much disconcerting.

And he looked and sounded just like Geldof. Let me get you a pint of that, whatever it was. Oh, the union. Yes, please. 44.

Do you wanna stop that guy or We'll keep it running. Okay. Because that'll give I'll give Maureen a break in the middle. Maureen. Maureen.

Maureen. Maureen. Get some Maureen down here all the time. Don't leave my my work laptop unlocked in the pub garden. Never mind.

I survived. I should have locked it. That's terribly bad, you know, civil service etiquette, leaving your machine unlocked. Been drummed into me over the years. You got you got a lovely little, Dortmund Union glass there as well.

Ah. Which prompts, you know Oh, happiness. And it will take a little picture of you. Maybe a proper there Hopiness. Hopiness.

I mean, this phone is just ridiculous. Hang on a minute. That's two phones. Yeah. That's Ethan's old phone Uh-huh.

That I use for recording. I see your two phones. And I have my antique. Yeah. That's a poor picture of you, but it's Gary's picture of the beer.

That's amazing. You're look looking, what's the word, lovingly. So, thinking about the record and what's on. Shrisek. There's a lot of mention of buses.

Because are you so is and and and a mention of so I think Next Move Sideways is a mention of there's reference, I think, to the to some Next move sideways is a howl of protest. Against the next move forward. Mhmm. Yes. Oh, that was some sort of That was their nonsense they were talking at the time.

You have to understand that when I was living here, and by 8788, I was living here, in order to go anywhere, I had to pick up my guitar and my amplifier or my suitcase or all three. And I had to walk a mile and a half over a hill in that direction until I met up with the a 43. And at the end of that street that came out on the A 43, on the other side of the road was the bus stop. I then take the bus into Northampton. I then get on a train to London.

I then get a tube train up to Mackenzie Road, and then I would be taken care of. So one day, I set out to do this in '87, and I arrived at the bus stop to find that there was no bus stop. It had been dug up. I was therefore obliged to walk another mile and a half along the A 43 as far as Tifield, where I stood outside the bad lads home until a bus finally came and took me where I wanted to go. Well, I wasn't having that.

Is a new is is a new road being built somewhere? Yeah. It was when they were building the, you know, what now passes for the Oxford Road. Yeah. Yeah.

Basically, it's it's like the second verse says. It's like they've got their pretty little toaster with all their nice little old buildings and the rest of it, and they don't want scum like us getting in there. So they they they root us around. Yeah. So, I mean, that's certainly the first two verses.

So that are pretty much just a literal description of what the hell is going on. And as for the old Romanian saying that was kids tiptoeing through the road manager's living room sometime in the middle of the '87, we'd we'd become so skinned at this point that because, you know, we hadn't done any work. We'd become so skinned that we'd become stuck at the tour manager's house in Wandsworth. We couldn't get out. We didn't have enough money to get back to an end.

And, yeah, in the middle of that sometime, I I sort of half half woke up in the middle of the night, and I just saw kids shuffling past, carrying a chessboard in the middle of the night. Smoking on the bridge like a tourist by the houses of Harlem? Well, third verse, things get a little bit inside out, don't they? Like, some songs sound like they're about girls, but they're not. And other songs sound about there's sound like they're about politics, but they sound out to be about girls.

Having a very emotional day one way or another. That's lovely. Yeah. So that's, yeah, it all goes gets turned a bit inside out. She was I mean, she's actually there in the second chorus.

What do you do when potential is your favorite word? You know, I was still a young man in those days. I was just pushing 30. And one thing that you used to hear a lot of in the eighties, if you were youngish, was people using this word, potential. I don't know what the equivalent would be now.

Brexit, perhaps. Anyway, you still have much the same feelings in me as Brexit. You know, the answer the answer to this whole potential nonsense that the English middle classes go whinging on about all day long. Two words, Peter and Cook. He's gone to his potential.

He had his own nightclub and his own magazine by the time he was 25. Where was he supposed to go? He'd done it all, mate. He was done with you. He was done with you.

You could not follow him. You fill me with inertia. Yeah. I think I should've shown you another sort of book I picked up probably at a charity sale somewhere with the the complete Pete and Doug sort of scripts, I think. I have it.

Yeah. I have it. Yeah. No. I I'm I'm very divisive about this.

I'm very pro cook and cannot even stand the thought of Dudley Moore. But at some point, there's no separating the two. Yeah. I suppose. I'd like to strike a happy medium.

Well, I suppose, it's worth saying that, you know, the the whole album sounds different because there's no maps on it. Oh, for sure. Yeah. And and he and he, I think I read somewhere, will openly sort of say that some of your best stuff is during the fourteen year hiatus. You know?

I don't think it was as long as fourteen years. Eighty six. So you knew We were we were playing again by '91. Oh, really? Okay.

Yeah. I mean, you know, this is the this is the thing. When you not recording again until February. Oh, we didn't record again for a long time, but that was just circumstance, you know, like, get the opportunity to record. But it was January 1990 while we were making Cult of the Basement.

He invited me to his birthday party down in London. And I thought, oh, there's a turn up. So I went I took the night off, went down. And, yeah, we ended up doing some playing at the party that night. So that's only, like, four years.

And, like, by the mid nineties, we were doing things. There was this little bar in Northampton that Imaj used to have called Slurps. Yeah. I think he saw you at Slurps. Yeah.

Right? Yeah. He was awful. He when I I saw him there. Quite possibly.

Yeah. But, yeah, he used to come up and do things there sometimes. And, yeah, by '96, we were like even though you know, the band broke up in '95. And then by the end of '96, the band was kinda like him and me again. It was all very doesn't doesn't make any sense.

Never did. Oh, the song Out of Touch? Out of Touch is Oh, before oh, shoot. Before we get on to that, I just wanted to mention the the the laugh at the start of next move sideways. Nice nice to start another with a laugh, I thought.

I like it. It was such a nice cackle that I thought I'll just leave it there. Yeah. I like little details like that. So, you know, on on records, like, sometimes at the end of a song, you might hear the drum stool move as he gets up or something like that.

You know, it's it's just lets you know that it was made by people and not by a pack of robots working as a committee. Out of touch then. Sorry. Out of touch. Perfect Disaster had a guitar player called Danny Cross or sexy Daniel Cross as I used to call him.

And he introduced me to a very simple game. And you take your notebook, and you fold the page in half. But before you do, you make some sort of cross lines all the way down the page, then you fold it in half. And you take one side of that paper and you just write random words down. Bell.

Hopeless. Fish. Sad. Breakfast. Toilet.

Arthritis. You fold it over so that your mate can't see and you hand it to him and he writes down horse, biscuit, Jennifer, all the way down. And then you open it up and you see what you've got. And I would estimate that about 60% of the lyrics on Out of Touch were built using the JBC lyric generator. Milk bohemian, devious plant.

Oh, and here's Fishy to come up with the rhyme. I'm sure he'd like to take his place in history, but everybody knows assures me he can't. But I don't know. I've been out of touch. I just dropped by to say hello.

It's talking about having a life that goes work work work work work work work work and then 1997. Off the edge of a cliff almost. Well, it wasn't off the edge of a cliff. It was just like, what are we gonna do now? And, you know, what's going on out there?

Because you gotta bear in mind, I wasn't living in London at this point. I was living right here that summer, you know, with a bewildered girl from the Lower East Side. I said to her, I said, welcome to the British Midwest. So, yeah, out of touch is about that, really. Kinda self evident.

But David Bowie did some sort of, had had some sort of, lyric generator like that. He he followed the Burrows cut ups technique. Yeah. Yeah. Cut up.

Yeah. And, I mean, we've we've done that too. I mean, I don't I don't think there's anyone who's ever heard of those techniques who hasn't tried them out. You know? And we later on, we got into using oblique strategies quite a lot.

Yeah. You're good. Yeah. But, yeah, the old lyric generator actually is is quite good fun. And there was an interesting development in 2015 where we I was showing you know, to the quartet, I was showing them this.

We were out on on tour in France, and, Graham's boy, Leighton, had come out with us. Lovely chap. And Leighton got unbelievably taken with this game. He really he really took a shine to it. And Leighton, it was, who introduced the triple fold.

So suddenly, you could get three words assembled at random. And pretty much the first time we tried this, we unfolded the page, and one of the results we got was wet nurse world. And this delighted Leighton so much. For about twenty four hours, he cackled about Wet Nurse World. That sounds like a dodgy magazine.

Doesn't it, though? Get It Wrong. Is that about infidelity? Is that just about infidelity? Well, I mean, Get It Wrong is basically a very obvious joke.

I think when Alex and I were touring in '87, we were playing a lot of because we'd kind of done the hip places before Christmas with the band. And, like, the the places that we were doing in early eighty seven just as a duo were largely places that hadn't quite caught on yet, so they weren't that hip. So you'd quite often find ourselves late at night in these, like, French nightclubs where the music was really a little bit anodyne or a little bit sort of safe. You know? And I think that is how poor old Marvin got it in the neck for that.

I think the idea is just to sort of, like, parody parody the, like, let's have a shag songs, which I've never really liked. But oddly enough, given the state of my personal life at that stage of the game, there are lines in that that are actually sort of quite considered. Alright. So if any jealousy is only messed up pride, it only twists you up inside, we don't need it. We don't feel it.

So and bear in mind, this is all before I got married. This is all before I was, like, involved in any of that. So oddly enough, although it's quite it's just it's, you know, it's a poor excuse for a song, basically. But I really enjoyed doing it, and I enjoyed doing the singing on it because, you know, I do actually love soul music, and it was kind of fun to do that Marvin thing with loads and loads of the same voice going around all bouncing off each other. I enjoyed doing that.

And I really I really enjoy, Bitchy and Ritchie. You know? That That's one of those lines. Yeah. Been back couldn't have been done before or since.

Well, it's just one of those it's one of those ones where you sort of it pops into your head and you you can't do that. And the trouble with me is whenever I say to myself, you can't do that, I go, oh, yes. I bloody can, and probably write it down with a biro. And a lot of, Fishketak was written in isolation just up the hill in Schuttlanger in a tiny, tiny room with a cassette player. And there was a lot of that, you can't do that.

Yes. I can. And there was also a lot of drinking because, of course, we'd had, like, two years of, like, free drink every night. And, we'd all developed really quite serious drinking habits. So when I was writing Fischlottetech, I was, a, very isolated and alone, and, b, largely pissed.

And, you know, lines like that, Bitchy, Lionel Richie. You can't. Yes. I can. No.

You can't. Yes. I can. You can. You know?

Just these these arguments you have with yourself. Like the time that I dug out the old tape of, Caroline Wheeler's birthday present, and I said to the cat, we know a classic when we hear one still. The, you know, the internal dialogue that goes on quite often out loud is absolutely laughable. You wouldn't believe it. You really wouldn't.

But I do. You know, I have shouting matches with myself. Which takes us inevitably to living in it. Yeah. Well, I mean, that I've written right here.

Written right here. I've probably been in this pub that very night. You know? And, yeah, it began with the the locution. You're living in a village.

And I don't know. Like, just that Graceland stuff, just that Zulu music got into my head. You know? Is it is it a calypso style? Would you would you say it's a calypso?

It wasn't what I was aiming for. I was aiming for a sort of South African, Zimbabwean pop style. Oddly enough, we never quite got that until Stevie Greffler. Yeah. I saw that And he just had a he had a real he had a real facility for that beat.

I I I was saying to the band, I said, well, we could try this one. It's very simple chords, but I don't know about the beat. I don't really know because it's an African beat, and I don't know as a as a musician quite how to describe it. Do you know what I'm talking about, Steve? And he just played it.

And I yeah. That's it. That's it. Right. You got GCD.

Come on. And so we did it for a while. It's kind of fun. Also, because I'd learned to play a nice sort of African guitar part for it. It was fun to be able to play that as well.

It was just nice to be able to, enjoy the playing. Is is there affection or more need to get out? Because there's definite lines of gotta get out of this village. Yeah. Yeah.

Goober, goober, goober, get out of this village. Yeah. I mean, that was very much the vibe because it's not so much talking you know, it's not really the village's fault, but it's the fact. Again, you know, of having been grounded here for several months. And it's like, no.

Transport being poor and Well, yeah. Once literally, once the bus had gone. Yeah. Because because they say, isn't it? You'd rush right to the city, but the bus don't come this way because you're living in a village.

You know? So, yeah, I mean, that that that poured out in about three and a half minutes, I should think. Let me tell you the, funny thing about Sutlanger's Wikipedia entry, which I think has been infiltrated. It has one? I think it's been infiltrated.

Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know, if you could work if you could work at Wikipedia, you might have done it yourself. But there is a line in Shudnoyne's Wikipedia entry which says Friday. There is also an abandoned double decker red bus Either at the Brad Lawn.

Train tracks and a large collection of vintage porn from the seventies. Famous residents include ancestors of the Bridgerton Gap. Now that's not for me, is it? Someone's inserted that. I've no idea.

I don't know about any double decker bus. There's old railway tracks and parts of Paul in the woods for sure, but, you know, you show me an old railway track with woods that hasn't got parts of Paul in it. We're talking about this just the other night, actually, Duran and I. It's been like white dog shit. You know, in the seventies, every ticket had born in it.

Famous residents include ancestors of the Richardson gang. I it just it just it just stinks of fake light, and someone's just stuck in for a laugh, I think. But that's I have no idea. I mean, the only people I know that came from here that were famous, Derek Redmond, the Olympic runner. And I often wonder if he might possibly be Nathan Redmond's dad, you know, Nathan who plays for Southampton Football Club.

I don't know, but, you know, they're just black men called Redmond. There are probably quite a lot of those, but, yeah, they were they were the first black people to move into the Shuttlanger, the Redmonds. And, yeah, Derek was just a a little boy, you know, nine years old. He ended up being an Olympian. Embraced by the Midwest.

The black kids in the village, embraced by the Midwestern white folk. I don't think there was any difficulty. No. It's good. No.

I know a bit of a novelty, I think. Yeah. We already had Indian people living here. But, yeah, no. I don't I don't remember any animosity towards them at all.

They're nice people. Talking of black dogs here, there's there's obviously a mention in living in a village. Oh, well, I mean Walking on stilts in those days. No. It wasn't dog shit.

It was the in. They used to march the up and down the roads when I was in Nipper, and the roads would really you know, they'd be, like, two or three inches deep in cow shit everywhere. That's what that is. I mean, most villages were like that in the sixties and the seventies, I think. You know?

Just mook house walking about. Yeah. And I like mook house a lot, but they're a bit careless where they dump. Swell is this week's song, I think. Yeah.

That was written for the tie in the angry American wife. Although there's no actual literal stealing from it, a lot of the vibe from that comes from a Velvet Underground song called It's Alright. You know, It's Alright the Way That You Live, which at the time was only on bootlegs. It's come out a 100 times now on various bits and pieces, but Lou had a very nice song about it's just one of those sort of arm around the shoulder songs. It's just like, don't worry about it.

It's supposed to be one of those. And so I guess, you know and again, I mean, what what are my experiences of songs that put arms around my shoulder? Well, a lot of them are from Lou Reed. You know? And the chick's from New York, and the whole thing gets that vibe.

I wasn't particularly happy about the rendition. We tried it with that same rhythm section of Preacher and Errol that did, lot 49. But Errol in particular really wasn't quite up to it. So in the end, we canned the rhythm track and just rebuilt it with, one of those cheapo sort of home entertainment drum machines. We wanted it to sound cheap.

You know? And then Lawrence came in and put bass over that. That's the first thing he recorded with us. Doesn't matter what time you get home. Yeah.

All that it doesn't matter stuff was very much that was the vibe of it's alright the way that you live. I think that if there is a grow up and shut up. If there is a direct lift in there, it may well be that line that it doesn't matter about the streets you're walking down. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that turn up in it's alright the way that you live. But, again, you know, that that was it it did matter at the time because half the time we were in Manhattan and half the time we were right here.

And that's quite a strange thing to do. You know? So to say that doesn't matter, it's a sort of, you know, saying there's more important things. Looking for not 49. Well, it's pretty obvious.

I haven't read any Pynchon. Mhmm. Do I need to go away and read the book? It's as good a way into Pynchon as any because it's quite short, and it's very funny. It was it was the first thing of his that I read, and it made such an impression.

Because lot 49 in the book is all about a sinister alternative ancient postal service. I know that sounds ridiculous in an age where, like, we've got Whistle and UPS and all these different people. But in the old days, when we just had the post office to read about this sinister underground post office network, you know, it was it was it was crazy shit. And, it was at a time, 8687, when we were starting to get quite a lot of mail. 50 Banks Lane, wasn't it?

Yes. Sikorsky's house. Whose house? Earl Sikorsky. Yeah, how much I've written?

I must I'm sure I've written that. Yeah. There was a there was a We we would little fans even. Also, what's Yeah. Whatever.

Yeah. Well, Dave Dave Barker said. Right? All proper pop stars have a fan club. And so we did.

And then what we what we hadn't expected was that anyone was gonna write in. We thought it would just be a cool thing to put on the record sleeve as though we had a fan club. And then suddenly, because we put that there, we did. And like these letters would, they would lift your game, especially in that '87 when nothing was happening. You know, it was it was a real lift.

Some some bloke suddenly writes in from, like, Switzerland or something. You know, it's, it gives you a lift, and that's what I wanted to say in the song. Plus, of course, there's a load of hilarity because Alex, the saxophone player, despite the melody maker routinely describing him as a session sax player at the time, was actually a postman. So, you know, there's that man on the side with egg in his hair. He's got hands like Des Nilsen.

I don't like his stare. Every time I look out of my window, he's there. But he's under the postman. Yeah. Yeah.

It's it's getting all sinister. Right? But, oh, of course, it's sinister. It's Alex, the postman. Didn't realize that.

Yeah. Yeah. There was this weird thing for about three live reviews in a row. The melody maker just moaned and said, oh, they'd be better off without that session sax player. And I used to write him letters.

Like, he's not a session sax player, you muppets. He's a fucking postman. Quite like, cold light of day and the heat of the night. Makes me wonder if languages turned out quite right. Yeah.

And I think the thing that makes that is the that makes the song is the sort of manicness of it, but then the then the break, you may want want to carry on. The break there. That that's Yeah. So Which I'm sure it's it's tried and tested, and it's it's been done lots of times before. I know, but it's it's, it makes it stand out.

Yeah. It has effective, I think. Yeah. It allows the lyric to sort of jump in and take center stage. Which yeah.

It's it's startling, you know, in a way. Yeah. Alan last night, Alan Moore had a couple of hours on BBC six music with Richard Norris from the grid, and he was talking about Patti Smith, the song break it up. And he was saying there's a moment where she says, and I broke on through. And he says it's it's almost like there's a beat that misses before she does it.

I don't know, but it's it's it's a real moment. And it went by. You know, I heard the moment, and I went, oh, well. And he's just squelched the high hat. That's all.

It's just for effect. But, you know, this is this is the thing. For us, like, it's nuts and bolts. It's just like putting a motorcycle together in your garage on a Saturday morning. But even for someone like Alan, it makes all the difference.

You know? So you mentioned Patty, who is now obviously in the in the naughties. She's she's picking poems from the the anthologies. Yeah. But back then, she's, well, she's there for some girl, some fictional girl called Susie.

Some, you've already mentioned her being a Susie the cipher. Yeah. The cipher. Yeah. Yeah.

But when she was Pissing on AT. Pissing on so many middle aged ladies in America's dreams there, but it's a cipher lady. Sorry. But she's, I've I've had women walk up to me after gigs and say, hi. I'm Susie.

That's literally happened to me. But I quite like that it paints a picture even if it's fiction. It may not be entirely fiction of when she was 18, see what sort of paint No. That's me. That's me.

When I was 18, I saw the Patti Smith group on TV, and it changed what I wanted to be. It's you know? Yeah. As I say, she's just a a mechanism. And the whole song was, like, conceived as a sort of cowl of self justification.

And I was still feeling really paranoid, and I didn't know if I was gonna get back in with this record that I was writing. I didn't know if it was gonna be enough to put me back where I'd been. And if it wasn't, what the bloody hell was I gonna do with the rest of my life? You know? Go back.

So I was the lawyers. It was quite a not a not a chance. It's not that I couldn't do it, but there's no way to earn a living, is it? Making money out of other people's problems. No.

I I really like the baseline in Susie. I think it sort of trots along. Oh. Underneath everything. Oh, Greenwood.

Yeah. He came he came up with that by himself. It's it it it kinda tickled me because it's quite purple. You know, it's it's quite portentous. Yeah.

But it kinda sits alright. Kinda sits alright. I've been I've been flirting with doing Susie now for several months, and I thought I might get it out in Paris, but I ended up to have I just had too many songs to fit in, so it had to go. What's the bit about, you have to you just believe your own publicity. You have to live somewhere, don't you see?

Yeah. Well, I mean, this is the thing. It's 1987. I've been doing it for about three years properly, professionally. I've had this little hiatus, and I'm looking over my shoulder.

I'm looking over my shoulder. I think I'm I think it's quite possibly I might be finished. You know? And there's that line, if you don't know what's so good about candy, don't ask Susie and me. Well, earlier that same evening, I put on the John Peel show, and I heard these idiots from Stowbridge going, what's so fucking good?

What's so fucking good about candy? And I said, well, if you don't know, you know, if if you don't have drugs in Stourbridge, then I can't help you. Pathetic. And then people ask me the strangest questions, such a fate and such a illusion. Yeah.

I mean, that's that's just yeah. That is just like, you know experience you felt that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

That people would would would, you know, there's a bit of an element of pedestal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, people yeah.

Of course. People come and then, you know, they go like, oh, it's so great. This is such great art. You're thinking, well, love is just dog rule and multitracking. You know?

It's it's no big deal. But then as that verse rolls on, then you get the the money dies on it, and suddenly it becomes a product and it becomes you know, someone's got this touching faith in a transparent illusion, and somebody else is going like, yeah. Right. That's it. You're not seeing your friends.

You're doing this. And, you know, it's just it's just a sort of Just like Morris dances. Well, yeah. Again, that's looking over your shoulder. It's like, mate, you finished.

You're out you're out of date. This is this is old hat, you know, what you're doing here. And in fact, if you look at where we are historically at the dawn of '88, you know, we've only got four months to go until acid house suddenly explodes and middle wall of guzzling ecstasy, you know. So I wasn't I wasn't that far off with that. But, yeah, it's just, And, of course, the sort of sock is is is made in a way by Sonix.

You can describe it as an outburst. You know? It's quite, Yeah. Quite an effective outburst. Yeah.

No. He was he was always gonna be the man for the job. He was always gonna be the man to do that. So should so he just comes in to stick his guitar? Yeah.

You know, I can't remember if he came down back. I don't remember if he came down to just socialize and hang out or if he came down specifically to do that. He must have brought his back with him, so he probably came deliberately. Yeah. But, yeah, I knew I wanted him to do that.

So how does he how does he actually, engineer that noise? He turns it up chronically loud. He hits the appropriate bits, and then he goes mad with the old whammy bar. So you get, like, stuff. He's really good at that.

But there was an amusing moment. We got him in the studio, and I'm sitting in the controller, and I'm coming down and talk back. I go, alright. So all you gotta do, man, is just wig out. It's just d.

And he goes right here, and it goes quiet, and we're, like, queuing it up. And then he comes back down to talk back. He goes, Pat, I got Sonic. He goes, which string's d? I shit you not.

I shit you not. That guy you know, he got two albums in the can at this point. Which string's d? Show me again. Show me again.

Yeah. Yeah. But as as you see, it kinda turned out for the best. Yeah. It was a very social session there because Perfect Disaster were working in one of the other studios nearby, and we got them in do some daft backing vocals on the Chicken song.

And, yeah, they were there. And, oh, there's all sorts of people. Knox came in. He was working with Charlie Harper next door with The UK subs. It was great to meet Knox.

He sat there and he went, I'm thinking about Charlie. Right? He's kind of a genius. And, you know, I suppose he is. And I think also sort of what makes the end of that record, of these, lines, what could I do but care?

I think it's quite Issue payoff. Yeah. Cool. And, of course, Sonic had those away. There was kind of his payment for doing the feedback was when he did that song Angel on his solo LP.

And you actually hear him going. He goes, hey, Pat. What could I do but care? So it's like a little payback thing. This is this is the moment where it starts to get complicated between Sonic, Jason, Phil Parfit, and me because we're all nicking bits out of each other's songs and then giving each other little, what's the word, acknowledgements.

You know? So, yeah, I once turned up at this radio station in, LA, at Loyola University, And the guy there was obviously completely uninterested in this band that had been sent for him to interview. And the first thing we did, he was going into the sort of record racks and just nosing around the records and paying me really no mind at all. And I pulled out Sonic's 12 inch of angel, which had just come out since we'd left the country. And I was like, oh, yeah.

I'm on this. He's like, oh, really? Yeah. I'm doing the finger pops. And, well, play the record, and I'll show you.

So we had Pete singing what can I do but care on that? And then I found that he had, Asylum Road by Perfect Disaster. And we were doing Girl Go on the tour, and I said, well, you see, you gotta understand. This Girl Go here, right, this is stolen from this on Perfect Disaster. And if you listen to the French sample at the top end of Girl Go, you'll hear her saying, which is to say, have you seen All the Stars, which is the title of the Perfect Disaster song we're ripping off.

Yeah. An hour later, we were still at it. Because, like, he went from, like, not knowing who the fuck we were, like, get this off my shoe, to, like, putting together all these connections, and he was just fascinated. It just it just didn't stop. And that's what it was like around that period.

We're all just vibing off each other and hanging out and you know? Anything that anyone said could end up in somebody else's song. We'll we'll go back to the chicken songs in a bit. But thinking about the sort of nice way to wrap up the album with, keeping the curtains closed and which is Dal Vitsy again, I guess. Mentioned as a bus stop again.

There's a recurring bus stop thing. Yeah. Because when he comes around, he'll be as happy as a boy can be. Yeah. But he's not coming around.

That's the trouble. We've established that on track one, side one. You know? This is the problem. So what's he doing?

Oh, he's doing that thing again. He's walking away again just like Love Kittens, just like mine, like a playgroup, just like my desert. He's walking away again, and he's keeping the curtains closed. You couldn't make it clearer, could you? Yeah.

Nice nice little song. Yeah. We played it the other night. Me and Tim, it's the first time I'd ever played it out live. The the way best chicken.

I always saw until I looked it up, with Orson Welles. It sounds like an Orson Welles app, doesn't it? And it turns out to be some guy called Hello? What's that? Turns out to be some guy called Bob Steele, a Connecticut radio.

That's him. Yeah. So you must have reported it somehow when you're in America, or you got a hold of it somehow? I got a hold of it from Barry Hale, who runs Threshold Studios. It's a film thing.

We go he's he's the same generation as me, Dave Jay, Northampton Geezer. And he was always great on collecting just mad tapes and assembling mad cassette assemblages and so forth. And, yeah, he he had this guy rambling on about chickens, and I don't know what inspired it. I think it might have been the noises that I was making as I started putting down the backing track. I just you know, I'm just jack doing a jam in d minor.

I mean, it might as well be, like, careful with the axe Eugene by the Pink Floyd or something. And I'm just doing this jam, but something in it put chickens in my head. I think possibly just the sound of some of the guitars going. I don't know. But then it all came tumbling out.

You know, chicken over here, dead hanging under what? Mhmm. I wonder what that's about. It's pretty straightforward, isn't it, really? Yeah.

It got used. They did a film called Meathead, which was like one of these sort of radical vegetarian video cassettes, of course, in those days. And Captain Sensible did some stuff on it, and they they used our stuff. And it was brilliant because, like, someone had just, like, sneaked a camera into one of these horrible battery chicken sheds. And the tune is starting, and it's sort of the beat is just grinding.

You know? So and the camera's just panning out, and it's just a carpet of chickens as far as the eye can see. There's no floor visible. They're packed in so hard. So that easy.

They eat their own legs. Yeah. They do well, actually, what they do is they chew their feet off, but it was close enough for close enough for a dog roll. Rhymes with eggs. And rhymes with eggs.

I only know two words that rhyme with eggs. One is legs, and the other one is steaks. So given that I suppose you could say, you know, they go so damn crazy because they used to be steggs. It would be kinda true. But They're like pigs.

The legs, aren't they? Oh, yeah. They're pigs, I suppose, as in peg leg. Yeah. Yeah.

And segs, they're things that go on the end of clogs, and they steal bits on the end of your clogs. JPEGs these days. Yeah. Didn't really have access to that bit of vocabulary back then. Limited vocabulary artist.

But this, Bob Steele in, what I don't know where. What's the town in Connecticut? Rhode Island. There's a there's a famous town. It's not Ridgeport.

I know Rhode Island's a state in itself, isn't it? Anyway Bridgeport? His his hometown. There's a plaque in a wall. There's a whole thing on this guy, and he mentions this, philosopher Ken Morrister.

Yes. Who isn't, really? There's another Villa Thomas? Yeah. Cutting parts.

Yeah. Ridiculous. I mean, you know, when I was around these parts as a kid and even as an adult, you'd never see me walking on or by the road. I'd always be out there. So why are they on animals in the road?

Because they're fucking entitled bourgeois filth. That's right. I want to bring everyone to a bleeding standstill for their own personal convenience. And then the last thing on the album we haven't mentioned is Chicken Town that the thing must be half murdered by that band. It's not the only thing those poor souls half murdered.

But you've got, you know, you gotta give him points for trying. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I It takes a nasty picture of Chicken Town. So Yeah.

I mean, to some extent, it's justified. I used to like that line where people where people look upset because the weather's bad again. That was that was from direct personal experience on the Market Square one morning, these people just walking around scowling because the weather's bad again. He said, well, what do you think? It's England.

It's November. You know? Grow up. I said to my wife before, you know, embrace the rain. Come on.

Cheer up. Yeah. It's only water. Yeah. Yeah.

I've, I went on a long tramping walk at one point. You know? I don't know who I thought I was. Eric Blair or someone. I thought, you know, I can pretend to be a tramp for a few days.

So you hit the road? So I walked about a 100 miles in three days Wow. Which is which is a pace that no tramp would would ever make. Stupid stupid paste. And I ripped my shoes to shreds.

Yeah. Feet to shreds. Yeah. And and I and I had and there was a day where I got wet and dried walking and got wet and three times over, which is which is what happens when you're tramping. Yeah.

You you you get wet, but then thoroughly wet, and then you dry out through the walking, and you thoroughly dry Fluff up. And then all over again. One night, I slept in, the away dugout of a village, a village, football ground. Very appropriate that you should choose the away dugout, I think. So four, when did you?

Yeah. Yeah. You'd probably find the home one's much more comfortable. I think this is the trouble with the Spurs losing away at the minute is, like, they just, you know, they just now they've got their new super baths at the new super stadium. It's like anything else.

It's like, boss, boss, I can't I can't work with this. Yeah. There is there's a whole thing about psychology of of away dressing rooms, isn't there? Mhmm. Being uncomfortable and, in hospitable places.

Oh, very much so. Palatial. And I've seen I've seen it at the I I went on a tour of the Leicester ground, I think, once when I worked in Leicester. Oh, yeah. And that's very much like that.

Yeah. No. They it's a deliberate it's a deliberate thing. When, there was a many years ago now, Manchester United were drawn in the third round of the FA Cup at Northampton Town. And, of course, United had our glory glory song away.

Right? They always sing glory glory man united. And about six weeks before the game, my mate Curtis showed up, and he had got hold of a CD copy of that lost Joe Meek album, I Hear a New World. And in amongst the daft outer space instrumentals was the weirdest version of Glory Glory you've ever heard. It's a Woah.

Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah.

Mental space age Joe Meek music, right, of the Glory Glory song. And I thought if we could get that to Northampton Town and they could play that as United come out, that would really mess with their heads. You know? It's it's your tune, but as you've never heard it before. But sadly, we didn't pull it off, and United won the game.

Well, we finished off, chicken town. German shepherd. I like some of the references, some of the lyrics in that German shepherd man. Yeah. And as I said before, the filling out with drone.

Got empty fertilizer bags and so on. Yeah. Empty fertilizer bags would be part of my youth. Used to sit on them and slide them down the side of the old railway embankments. So, like, empty fertilizer bags were our sort of toboggans.

You know? Yeah. I like some lyrics in it. It's not I sometimes feel a bit churlish for writing it because, you know, I'm quite fond of Northampton. Yeah.

But when you get up to the sort of administrative end of things, if you get, you know, you get up to the people who are actually allegedly running the show. Yeah. That's deplorable. It's been happening. Yeah.

They're they're a bunch of corrupt filth. You know, chicken town maneuvers keep the punters on their toes in a small town, don't they? And, you know, the the police protect the villains because the villains know the law. I'm gonna hold up in my living room and lean against the door. You know, you you gotta understand.

If you if you're gonna move into Northampton, it's gonna take them twenty five, thirty years before they talk to you. And they weren't talking to me yet at this point. And this was before they were, you know, spending millions of pounds on, on fictional football signs and all sorts of stuff and and generally bankrupting the place. Well, the the Cardozers are yet to sink their teeth into the town's money. Yeah.

But it's just really I mean, it's it's just a general criticism of, like, corrupt small town bourgeoisie thinking. You know? And also that kind of preemptive, scornful, resentful thinking among the supposedly working classes that allows the knobs to get away with their outrages. You know, if if people sit and go, and they're all in the same man and all that sort of nonsense, then yeah. Yeah.

Well, there you go. You've just voted to be shafted right there. You know, if you really think that you if you really can't distinguish between, like, Dennis Skinner and Michael Heseltine, if you really can't tell the difference between David Lammy and fucking Laura Goonsperk. You know, you're talking nonsense, my friend. You're you're you're just throwing in the towel.

You're just you're just voting for you're just voting for the far right, if that's what you think. What's the what did you say in Paris about your parents and the bourgeoisie? Oh, I I I said I was eternally grateful to them for giving me a silly hard mistrust of the bourgeoisie. And then Tim bless him and goes, yeah. Right on.

I said, they didn't do it on purpose. Yeah. Yeah. I know. It's just hanging around with some of the people my mother used to associate with around here.

It's just very educational. Likewise, getting sent to the fucking Rutland. Being around the children of the nineteen seventies bourgeoisie, that, you know, that turned me more lefty than anything could have done. Which is why you didn't wanna go back that far. I don't want anything to do with it.

Don't want anything to do with it. I've done enough drives up there. Tell us about the, as we're in Shutlanger, tell us about the other the other song that's about Shutlanger. Eviva Schuttlanger? Oh, this year, I'm looking for a change.

Eviva Schuttlanger. Down where the cats have got the mange. Eviva Schatlanger. If you fancy a spot of something If you fancy a spot of Hesketh's game, perhaps, or cold bacon clanger. Or Hesketh's pheasants by the score.

Yeah. We used to sing it right in there. It was quite when Dave had it, there was a lot of folk singers who used to come down. And, one night, Max and I, we came in, and we were a little bit unsure of ourselves. So we went in the posh downstairs bar, and we found ourselves sharing the posh downstairs bar with 13 accordionists.

That'll be a murder of Yeah. Oh, it was it was a catastrophe. It was a it was a mass murder. It was, yeah, it was a mass murder in a multi story car park. It was just oh, man.

It was insane. Because, like, you know, they wouldn't all be playing the same tune. There'd be two or three gathered around learning one tune, and then there'd be couple over there learning another tune. And we'd just be sitting there going, I can't stand it. But, yeah, it used to be a jolly spot in those days.

And, yeah, on a couple of occasions, people drank so hard that they came out at, like, two in the morning and were found dead the next morning by the bus shower, which eventually, sadly, of course, led to Dave not having the pub anymore. So this other shot language song is of your invention? No. I didn't write it. No.

It's it's it's, as we put it, Trad r. No. I don't I don't know who came up with that. But, Well, it's copyright free then. I suppose.

Yeah. Not so sure about the tune. Right. Before we finish, tell me where where about spooky came along. When was that recorded?

Is that between, That was recorded in fish fish go tap and the It was recorded in May at a place called Greenhouse, which was also belonged to Pat Collier, but it was this sort of new upwardly mobile fancy studio. And we went up there. We took our Higgins again. It's up near Old Street near the city. Lovely, lovely facility, and it was absolutely running with hummus.

I don't know how much hummus me and Kizzy got through in that session. But then it got a bit ugly for me because I got toothache. While we were mixing it, I got toothache, and it was really severe. So I took these things called paracodol. And it they fizz up in your glass, and you drink them.

And they're quite effective at stunning a toothache, but I took so many of them that they began to hurt my kidneys. I can actually feel the pain in my kidneys. So the the end of that session was actually quite stressful. And then you made a video. Oh, we did that at the college at Booth Lane in Northampton with Mitch and Barry.

Barry was involved in that as well. It's before Mitch and Barry fell out. And a big smoke machine. Well, yeah. A smoke machine.

And the camera lingering lovingly on my American wife's behind. Oh, so you married your American wife by that stage? I married her in September in Toaster at a party up the street. Must have spent all of £75 on my wedding. Those were the days.

Well, you know, I mean That's all you need. Weren't we weren't deluded. All our mates came. We had as good a time as we had a good a time as we would have done if we'd spent $40 on it. So we didn't have $40 to spend.

Nobody did. So it's a very jolly day. We've had a couple of people over from New York. That was comical. Phil Parfit from The Perfect Disaster kept chasing this girl, Sabrina, from New York, who's sort of like I once heard Sabrina in, 1986 in New York complaining because she was only on $70,000 a year.

And, yeah, she came over here for the wedding and spent most of her time being chased around the woods by Phil Popfit. Oh, how we laughed. But then again, me and me and the missus got out fairly early in the evening and headed for Amsterdam. What carnage was left behind, I will never know. My parents are far too diplomatic to tell me what happened later.

So it's a proper family family do too. Parents were around. Yeah. And her parents came over as well. I think they were thoroughly bewildered by the whole thing.

Or has she got herself into it? Yeah. Vintage motorbikes. Maybe time to think about getting a less vintage exhaust, though. That'll do, I think.

Yeah.

Bingo. Hello. Clarity and waveforms, science and magic. Oh, rounds and catches. Haste the nymph.

Don't type all this out. Sacred songs. Transcripts that maybe you're getting too worried about. They are they are transcripts. So Yeah.

I I I was thinking that I think I'm right in saying that with Microsoft Word, there's a a thing where you can, like, get it to pull out a single word, and whatever you do to that word, you can macro it right across the thing. Right? Okay. First advice, remove all kinda. Remove all fucking.

I'll put them back in where I feel like it. But kinda and fucking can fuck off. And it'd be really nice if because could turn into because. Yes. I with that and those are the sorts of things that we we do need to agree on.

And I and I was thinking about that. It's gotta be in English. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not I'm not keen on the kind as in cause.

It's just the way you know? Yeah. It's just the transcript. Absolutely. It's just a transcript.

Yeah. I understand that. You know? Same with the punctuation. I know.

I understand why it's all over the place. It's just turns out to be a hell of a sweeping up job. I quite like the I quite like the swearing. Yeah. But it needs to be judiciously deployed.

Yeah. Measured, I guess. Yeah. Otherwise, there's little impact. Yeah.

You know, I mean, my conversational style, especially when I'm trying to explain things and sometimes backtracking and repeating, It's not really fit for putting down on paper. But there's still some there's some there's some nuggets there still. There's there's a few moments I spotted. Made me chuckle. Yeah.

Yeah. So I think, what I will probably do after transcribing this last one is to then have a go at one or two. You and I can share our thoughts having had Compare notes. Yeah. Yeah.

And and and Yeah. It'll it'll finesse a bit. I'm sure. Well, I mean, there's there's there's no alternative as missus Thatcher would have it. It's got to.

Yes. That's, that's why Oh, we we wanna put out my physical team. You know? There was no alternative. Yeah.

There was no alternative other than to stay while until the insurance was sorted out, regardless of whether I had a an important appointment. Oh, yeah. This is I'd be calling this an important appointment. So, I mean, I suppose with every new ton of work that we throw up for ourselves, it grows more important to us at least. But I did a little bit of, before we had the, insurance department.

Yeah. I was, doing finding some fun Jasper Churchill facts in numbers Oh, yes. Just to reflect on a bit. So Jasper Conspiracy has been in existence for thirty eight years. Has it?

Yes. Well, if you're saying eight, '82 and the twenty year the twenty year anniversary tour was 02/2002. And so Max and Max and I see the sort of foundation of the project from '82, really. Yeah. That's when we started making bath of bacon and so forth.

I suppose that for me, anyway, in my memory, the trigger date is the day after the Sonic Tonics reunion in the '82. And a lot, you know, a lot of the jazz butcher songs were written at that point and demoed on sort of, like, bedroom tapes. But it was pretty much just me doing it solitary. And it was like, I can remember taking the bus up to our place in Northampton the day after that tonics thing, taking the bus up with Ida and him going, like, what's with all these songs? And then that's that's pretty much the day that I would say that he and I sort of accidentally founded something that we thought was gonna last a couple of months.

So, yeah, I suppose '82. But the conspiracy itself, the actual existence of a band, that didn't really come about until early eighty four when we got Owen in on the drums and the first of a lengthy and complicated succession of bass players. I know we've talked before about the imperfections of the website, but I'm using it for reference quite a bit. Mhmm. And I counted up the total number of gigs.

Uh-huh. Just for fun, you know. And, this includes the solo gig. Yeah. Does he not run does he not run a count of that somewhere on the website himself?

Yeah. He does a yearly yearly count. Yeah. Yeah. How many do you think in total according to him in that record?

Somewhat I would think with Dave's rankings about between seventeen fifty and two thousand. No. That's a bit high. 1,200 he's listed. Really?

Yeah. 1,200. Eight four five of which were listed as JBC. Right. I'll look to see what because I I was I was thinking, there was something about thousandth appearance of something recently.

Was there? Yeah. That does ring a dim a dim and distant bell, but of no great significance to me to me, to be honest, because, obviously, there's so many different ways of doing things and so many different formats and groups of people that I don't really think of it in overall terms like that. The thousandth, according to his reckoning, was playing just in front of 15 people at the White Horse in Woodford with Steve Wilson. That was a night.

I don't even know how that gig happened. I think Steve must have booked it. How? I have no idea. I used to go to the White Horse quite a bit.

Well, probably a decade ago. Yeah. Whatever it was. There was it was a thoroughly moribund event. And do you have the name of the village that the white horse was in there?

It's in Woodford. Yeah. Woodford. Yeah. You see, that gate got moved.

Initially, I think it was supposed to be in a place called Isham. Either that or it was supposed to be in Woodford, and it actually happened in Isham. Did you go? No. I think so.

I did, but all I remember was that I was in the Badlands. And I can remember Steve Wilson properly freaking out. It's like, oh my god. We're going in the woods. Oh, what's gonna happen to us?

Oh, well, we'll probably get raped and eaten, Steve. Why do you ask? Yeah. Oh, Christ. What a, oh, what a thoroughly moribund evening.

Exactly what you'd expect of a pub in the out in the Badlands. You know? There was band on there, and, unbelievably, I remember their name. They were called Dave Boy Fish and the Wheel. And I think the idea with Dave Boy Fish and the Hiel was that they were supposed to be in some way comedic or or chummy or funny or something.

I don't know. I it's not for me to judge. I paid them no mind. Until at the end of this set, they started performing master master of the universe from the album Space Ritual by Hawkwind. Now, actually, me and this song have history.

You've mentioned Hawkwind before, I think. And we'll make we may possibly mention them again. Yeah. No. So as it happens, me and Master of the Universe have history.

But, on this occasion, Dave Boy Fish and his heel were performing this thing. And they'd really sort of when I did it a 100,000,000 ago in some band in school, not a real band, but just some sort of school jam session, I can remember doing it because that was the moment I met Rolo. Yes. And you've mentioned that. Yeah.

You've talked Should be a bit meaner, shouldn't it? Yeah. That's it. Yeah. But we were basically playing it quite sort of open and just because we were, like, 16 years old and didn't know anything.

So we were playing it to, like, like that. Whereas Dave Boy Fish and his eel, they pulled out the syncopation in the whole Queen version much more. They're kind. Pulling it out like that. And they did that for a few bars, and then Steve Wilson just looked at me across the table and went, is Vic there?

And that was it. We couldn't stop laughing after that. It's just like they were trying to sing the Hawkwind number, and there were these drunks at the back going, it's Victor. And that was our thousandth gig. Was it bloody Christ.

Well, according to the record, the the record. It it'd be much it'd be much nicer if we just forgot about that one and went to the next sort of nice gig with some people there and some money in the stage and some lights and shit. And no Dave Boyfisher. He'll doing his bit there. And then according to the record, there have been a 181 JBC songs or Jasper Butchers songs.

Mhmm. Plus the 14 Seymour's on it, plus the 13 Wilson. 208 in all. And we have mentioned in some detail most of them. Yeah.

Apart from 12 that I've listed. So I meticulously went through that list. I see. Just checked checked the ones that we had not covered and and arrived at the number 12. Oh, it's gonna be so much fun to see if you've got them all.

Well, yeah. Well, I've I've checked all the others. I'm pretty sure all the others are in. The ones that I think this I'm trying I've tried to list them roughly in chronological order, but, again, I may have got this wrong. Sure.

Cowgirl Fever. It's a Marnie b side. Yes. That owes a lot to the violent femmes. And what it owes to the violent femmes is the line, up the air.

There was a particular day in 1983 that turned into a very important day. The violent films were in London. Rolo and I were both very taken with their first LP. We thought it was a real sort of, like, return to basics, you know, and and really good songs as well and a good vibe. So we were we were right into them at the time.

And, they were in London, and they decided to you know, being able to do it with their instrumentation, they decided to go on a busking tour of the city. And we caught up with them in, Covent Garden, where they were singing a song called Girl Trouble Up the Ass. And so the Cowgirl Feeder thing was just really a piss takeout on that. It was, a wee tipo that. And there's large chunks of, It's Just Too Much by the Velvets of Live sixty nine in the middle as well.

Yeah. Yeah. Not not what I would describe as an exercise in serious songwriting. JB versus PM. Oh, just a minute.

I said that was an important day, didn't I? And it wasn't important because I managed to steal the words up, v, and arse of the violent femmes. That wasn't what was important at all. Once the violent femmes had expressed themselves in Sharpe and moved on, Rose said to me, have you heard the new John K LLP? I went, no.

He said, it's important. Come with me. We left Covent Garden, and we got on a train, and we went all down to, sort of North Clapham, Stockwell where he lived. And we went into his living room, and he put on Music for a New Society. And, he was not wrong.

He was not wrong. Bless him. That is a very, very important record. I was thinking of, John Kale songs or interpretations anyway. Yeah.

We've done a few, I guess. Sprint. But that's relating, to the 2020 Ida release. Oh, because yeah. Yeah.

Because Cahill does the, does the general Thomas, doesn't he? On Words for the Dying. Yeah. Do not go general. Yes.

You know, and Ida has taken that, throttled all the throttled all the fight out of it And it's and presented it as something beautiful. Very gentle. I I did you know, the the cruel streak in me did think, when he was posting this release, you know, that I must just write rage. Rage. Yeah.

In in a comments bar, but I I resisted. We should no. We should do better than that. We should, on a nice day in the summer, we should hire a bus from, Country Lion, and we should get a whole bunch of our mates on it. And we should make sure there's loads of booze and drugs on this bus.

And then having first carefully established that Ida is at home and not his girlfriend's house at the other end of the nation, we should drive this thing up in sort of football football outing sort of mode, everybody getting plastered on the bus. And when we arrive in, Spital, which is the name of the place where he lives, unbelievably, yeah, when we arrive in Spital, we just form a ring around his house just chanting rage, rage, rage, rage, and actually have an Ida riot. See what the Northumbria can stab for the remakes of that. It's the bloody worst thing since those Spurs fans invaded Carlisle. JVVPM?

Yeah. It is. Again, it's, it's sort of of that, era of rain and other things, isn't it? It was quite sort of tight, David j on bass and just that sort of, It is Dave on bass. Yeah.

It was recorded at the Scandal in Bohemia sessions. Yeah. What I really remember about it is, Owen doing his Neil Kinnock impression. The honorable lady thing is telling that we all had a nice cup of tea. And, yeah, there's there's a lot of mucking about on that.

Again, hardly a you know, these things are on b sides, so you can kinda guess that they're not the most important songs that ever got written. I'm trying to think of anything constructive to say about it. Mulraney had a nice take on that song. I don't quite know why, but on the eighty nine tour of America, we revived it. No idea why that happened.

And, Paul would introduce it with a little drum part of his drum part just, solo drum intro. That's what I'm trying to say. And he would play sixes. It would sound like a four, but he'd be playing sixes. He'd be going, like that.

And I don't know if he got the idea from there or not, but you can hear the same thing at the beginning of a David Bowie single, Modern Love. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know.

Yeah. Six played in a way that makes it sound as though it's a four, but then it trips you up every every couple of yards. Then you throw in a smart suit and a bleached blonde hair. That that sort of era. Yeah.

I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can kinda see him in my man's eye waving his microphone lead about.

Re trying to save the natives in Australia. That sort of time. That was the Let's Dance video, wasn't it, with the Aboriginal gents? Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. This is not a period of David Bowie where I was really paying a great deal of attention to him. But when Paul nicked that drumming trial, I thought, good work, Mul Rainey. And there's mention of, you know, lots of animals, isn't there?

And, and famous criminals. Henley Brady, Harding and Hobbs or something. Something almost like Yeah. Now you see Harding and Hobbs. That's weird.

Harding and Hobbs. Is it? Harding and Hobbs is or was. I don't know if it's still there. I hope it is.

Harding and Hobbs was a big old fashioned department store at Clapham Junction. It was it was very, very close to Starforce where we first recorded Martha Bacon. It was on on that same sort of part of Clapham. And it was wonderful in Harding and Hobbs. It was still it was still 1947.

It was absolutely lovely in there. And Ro and I used to take acid and wander around and look at all the pretty ladies who worked there. Yeah. So men who torture, murder, and rob. Okay.

We're gonna need some criminals. Oh, Finley and Brady, they're pretty criminal. We'll have them. No. No.

What rhymes with Robs? Oh, Harding and Hobbs. Mhmm. Well, they're completely innocent people. Let's throw them in with some bloody morse murderers.

So there you have it. Not really criminals at all. No. Their lawyers didn't spot it. And then I mentioned I listed You know what?

If they have closed down, I hope to Christ it's not our fault. I mentioned water like the, water. Yeah. What can be said about what a great deal does it happens? You know, it's a true story.

Right? No. I know it's about elephants. But Alright. I'm I've I've got the evidence right here.

The elephant in question lived in the Soviet Union in what is now Kazakhstan. The elephant's name was Batyr, b a t y r, Batyr. My mother discovered this story reading some newspaper or other, And she alerted me to it, and then I sort of picked up the papers and sort of got on it and read it for myself. There's a farm in Kazakhstan where, they had an elephant. I guess, you know, probably drag logs around or help out on the farm.

Haven't got a tractor. Don't need one. Go on, elephant. Thanks. It's like the old story about the Fisher space pen, isn't it?

The the Americans So there's this elephant on this farm, and they love this elephant, the people. They love him very much, and they talk to him as you would. And they sing they say things like, ah, Badir. Good elephant. Good elephant.

And, obviously, one of the things that they were saying around the elephant a lot was, has the elephant had any water? And it goes without saying, obviously. They're not saying this in English. At night, alone in the barn, the elephant is discovered, chuntering to himself, making human noises. And what he's saying, it's a bit like a parrot.

He is saying the things that he's heard around him. And the elephant says, good elephant. Good elephant. What? Has the elephant had any water?

Because he must have heard them say that to each other a thousand times. Right? Word got out. Scientists came from Moscow with tape recorders and all the rest of it. And sure enough, they had it on tape.

Elephant. Good elephant. What? The evidence, whereof I speak, is in later years, Kazakhstan issued a stamp with a picture of Batir on it. I have a copy of the stamp.

So it's all a true story. And I was ruminating on this one day. And this is really the biggest mystery about the whole song. Not that there's a talking elephant and that there is proof. No.

Not that. The real mystery of this is that I wrote this song while waiting for a bus on the way home from work at the law office. Only, I have a very, very vivid memory of being at a bus stop, not on Bridge Street as you would expect, Nor yet at the bus stop where I got off on the way to Shuttlanger. No. I wrote this song at a bus stop in Blisworth.

What I was doing in Blisworth, I will never know. But I got the idea for the song. Now I got the bus, and from my bus stop, as previously advertised, from my bus stop to home was another sort of mile and a half walk. And on that mile and a half walk, I quite often used to sort of, like, pull lyrics together and pass the time. You know?

And, yeah, by the time I got home, all I had to do was pick up the guitar and record it. It was it was finished. Because it's not the most complicated song in the world. But it speaks the truth, and people respond to that. Also, I do and I really like sitting there going and seeing just how long we could push it before the otter comes out.

Lost in France is listed, but it's not written by you, obviously. No. I don't know why it is listed, really, on in the in the list of songs, but it is. Gunfire and Pianos. In 1985, the great Mick Mercer, who wrote for the Melody Maker and who was the editor of Zig Zag, I think it was a Zig Zag sponsored thing.

He made a compilation LP called Gunfire and Pianos. And who's on that? Psychic TV are on that. The Membranes are on that. The Pastels are on that.

And Mick got in touch and said, do you wanna do something on that? I said, sure. And in the ensuing conversation, we had a bit of a laugh. And I said, yeah. I'm gonna do Lost in France by Bonnie Tyler.

Mick went, go on then. So I did. And, you know, we were talking about, how music for a new society was an important record in our lives. Well, when I went into Bugbrook with old Malcolm River Garnac to record this version of, Lost in France, I decided that I would record it in the fashion of music for new society. So the song is stripped of its clothes, flayed in places to the bone.

The click track remains running through the whole thing really loud with an echo on it, and it ends with the sound of me literally flinging the acoustic across the room. You never heard it? Yeah. You have heard it? Yeah.

Then you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. That absolutely. It's a little bit the same methodology, I suppose.

Dave Jay and I were both kind of into this. And, you know, I wanted to sort of, like, destroy the song and just just get to the sort of emotional car crash that is at the heart of it. And, of course, round about that same time was the the the series of dates out at Puckbrook where Dave and I went to record his version of, The Part is Over. Yes. And, again, you've talked about getting increasingly drunk, but not drunk enough.

That's That's right. He kept phoning up and going, you know, I've been listening. Not drunk enough. Yeah. And we keep going back.

Well, it's that time. Yeah. So it's that it's that sort of similar sort of methodology. It's like, let's let's really get to the heart of this by smashing it to pieces with a mallet. Deconstruct it until it's in pieces on the lawn.

Yeah. Until there's no hope of putting it back together again. It's the sort of thing you know, you hear you hear horror stories about customs officers who have the right to dismantle your car in the road, and not under any obligation to put it back together again if they find you innocent. And, you know, you're always hearing these stories on the road about somebody who had their bus reduced to the last nut and that were just left there. I don't I don't think those stories are necessarily I'm I'm not sure that they've got quite as much truth in them as the story of Batty, the talking elephant, to be honest.

But the theory is there. Death dentist. We were walking. Yeah. We were walking past, do you know that you must be familiar with the multidimensional roundabout over by Abington Park, where Abington Avenue comes down, Park Avenue North comes down, Millie Road goes off, the road to the M 1 goes off.

Yeah. We were just walking along there one night. There was me. There was Princess Alice, possibly Ida or Rolo. And we were making our way from my house on Birchfield Road to the Abington Public House where, almost scarcely, credibly, we used to drink at the time.

And we passed the dentist's office. And, you know, everyone's jabbering. And I don't quite know how it happens, but somebody says, sex dentist. And everyone's laughing, and I'm going, yeah. Well, we can't we can hardly have that, can we, on account of, you know, sex engine.

We can't really do sex dentist as well. People just think we got sex on the bloody brain. And in the remaining two two hundred and fifty yards to get to the APH, I thought but on the other hand, if you were to do a sort of what's that film called? You know the one I mean. Is it safe?

Is it the boys in Hoffman? Yeah. Is it the boys from Brazil? Is that the one? Marathon.

Marathon, man. Yeah. So yeah. Marathon, man. Yeah.

Yeah. You know, it doesn't it doesn't take much to, spark that into your head when it's 1982 or '83. So immediately, you know, that's it, isn't it? Oh, what's art about? Oh, sex and death.

Well, we've done sex, so it better be death dentist. Oh, that's got a nice ring to it. Yeah. Oh, if only we could get the supremes to go, he's going to get you. No.

No. No. I'm afraid that me and Max being the supremes actually comes out more like me and Max being Banana Rama, but there you go. And one of the most interesting musical ideas about death dentists and let's face it. There aren't many.

Was in the middle, in the instrumental section, you've got sort of, like, eight bars of that little rising guitar figure. And I just doing his Steve Barrett impressions. He's just kinda like making weird little crackly noises on his guitar over the top. And then it goes mental. And it's a little bit hard to work out what you're listening to.

Here's the thing. It's a drum solo. But it's a drum solo like a guitar solo. That is to say the rest of the music doesn't stop. Normally, people do a drum solo.

Everything stops. Everybody goes off stage and has a line of cocaine. And this poor Burke is left there trying to remember where he came where he came in. Wondering if his band are gonna come back or if they'll just go, oh, we'll just have another line. Shall we, lads?

You know? Drum solo on its own. We thought, oh, why don't you just do it like a guitar solo and just like well, you know, we'll do the track with the proper drums, and then you'd have a drum solo over the top of the proper drums. That's why it sounds like that because that's exactly what's happening. The monster that is the devil is my friend.

Yes. Which is, you know, seriously much more popular than you ever imagined it would be, I guess. Oh, god. And and I listened to a I think a live it might be on the website where there's, there's a tape of live recording where it sounds like the crowd are going absolutely mental. It's like, you know.

But did I ever tell you about the riot in, Ottawa? Don't think so. Okay. Well, this this is not really to do with music, but it's definitely to do with The Devil is My Friend. Played a gig in a place called Barrymore's Theatre in Ottawa in Canada.

It would have been the eighty eight tour. We had Kizzy on guitar, Paul and Lawrence in the rhythm section, and myself. And played the it's a beautiful old theater. I noticed early on, they had photographs of people who played there in the in the backstage area. And there was John Kale.

There was Miles Davis. There was Dolly Parton. Some big stars have played this theater. And it was a big old theater. It hold about, I suppose, 800 people, a thousand people perhaps.

And it was heaving. And, you know, we had a lot of backing in Canada, and I suppose there's not much else to do of an evening out there. So the place was heaving, and they're very enthusiastic, and we got an encore. During the time that we're backstage at the end of the set before the encore, someone goes, boy, look. Look at these daft t shirts this bloke left us.

And this bloke has been around the dressing room, and he's left us these bootleg t shirts. And they're just plain white t shirts, but with the Jess Paulkin on. Just white T shirts with a little pink piggy going in the middle of your chest. Now it's possible that drink and or drugs had been involved at this point, but or maybe we were just high on life after being clapped at by a load of overexcited Canadians. I can't say, but we thought it would be funny if we went back out for the encore, all wearing these shirts.

And so we did. Four pasty little English twats in matching pathetic white bootleg t shirts come back and take the stage. Somebody goes, the devil is my friend. Somebody else goes, the devil is my friend. Within about twenty or thirty seconds, we've got 800 Canadians stamping their little feet, clapping their little hands, going, the devil is my friend.

The devil is my friend. The devil is my friend. Four pathetic, pasty white boys pawned the stage in these laughable t shirts and 800 Canadians chanting like a football match or something. All chanting and stamping and going, the devil is my friend. Now this was at the time when Tipper Gore, Al Gore's wife, was doing her sort of campaign against terrible satanic music lyrics and all this kind of thing.

And I stood there, Fender El Rio hanging limply around my waist as I just stared in astonishment at this frankly quite frightening scene. The walls of the place were, like, shaking with this. Honestly, I cannot it was physical. It was palpable because they were all doing it. And I stood there with that guitar hanging off me, my arms limp at my sides, gaping at this spectacle.

And just thinking, oh, dear god. If only Tiburon could see this. And then, of course, we were obliged to play it. The Devil is My Friend was tacked on to the, human jungle sessions and came out as a kind of seaside on the 12 inch. And we hadn't Dave knew that we were recording human jungle for the a side, and he knew that we were gonna do death dentist for b side.

He had no idea that we were going to record The Devil is My Friend. The only time that anyone had really heard The Devil is My Friend being sung, there were never any instruments. It was just some drunken thing that you come back from the pub shouting it on your way home to go and smoke some drugs. It was just a stupid little joke like the elephant man or something like that. But while we were at Woodbine with John, we thought, let's stick it down for a laugh.

So Dave Barker shows up at the end of the session, and it's been a long session. God knows what it's costing because Woodbine's not a cheap place. Dave Barker shows up. Right. Let's what have you done?

And rather than playing the a side or death dentist, the first thing we played him was he's my friend. Dave sat through it, his face turning progressively grayer, and the thing finished. Dave looked at me and Max, and he went, oh, that's stupid. Laughing our heads off, we were compelled to agree. Yes.

Yes. It's very stupid. Sorry, Dave. Sorry. We squandered, like, $2 of your money recording this nonsense, but we've done it now.

And, yeah, Dave was really quite he quite got the hump about it, and you can't really blame him. But then somebody put it on that bloody nonsense compilation that introduced us to North America. And I think I may have made remarks about this before with reference to La Mer and My Desert, But it seems to me that nobody ever went broke taking the piss out of a country's national folk music. Because this brutally cynical, dismissive, stupid attempt at country in western. I mean, you you can kind of tell how the band feels about country in western by what they've done with it.

You know? It somehow just locked in the imagination of young eighties America. I suppose it was one of those terrible mistakes, like big hair and mullets and things like that. But, yeah, it just locked in. And oh, boy.

Oh, boy. The the Barrymore Theatre one is the night that we all remember, but there were scenes like that right across the continent. Yes. So it's, it's consciously stupid. And then Yeah.

Thousands of people embrace the stupidity of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, who would have ever imagined that people in America would do a thing like that? I quite like the, the the this is this is the time when the Soviets, Russians were were getting through a a leader every few months.

Yeah. And Deirdre Puffy just popped off. Yes. There was a kind of vodka at the time, cheap vodka. And in those days, we had no discernment about what we ate or drank, really.

And, we just buy what was cheap and effective. And you could get this vodka that probably came from, like, Scumthorpe or something called Popoff, p o p o v. And, you know, you'd be sitting there glugging this from the bottle in a phone box thinking, pop off. Because when you drink it, you do. And so, inevitably, poor old Andropov.

He's just Yep. And I quite like a idiot. I mean You know what I mean? That is the voice. Hang on a minute.

Just a minute here. This is messing with the whole picture. Because that no. No. It's not the voice of Dave Parker.

I was thinking, how would Dave be surprised and disgusted if he put his voice on it? But he hadn't. It was Phil, our road manager, doing an impression of Dave. That's what that was. Yeah.

But you know what I mean? I I just I like the fact that it's a bit of a punchline, isn't it? You know, everyone's your friend, but if you look just someone they make the point. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, you wouldn't wanna be friends with Idi Amin. He'd eat you. Is I mean, that is you know, there's there's a certain class of person, isn't there? I call them turners. And you start off having a jolly evening, and then they put down one pint too many, and they just become a nightmare.

I feel that edi amine falls into that category, and I'm not sure he even needed the extra pint. Yeah. I was sort of experiencing that at 11:00 in the morning, this morning in Wetherspoon. This this is before the roof blew off. I took my, son my eldest son for for breakfast.

It's it's a new thing of mine. Weather Weatherspoon's breakfast, they did quite a nice veggie, all ink fully full English veggie. And you Why don't you I tell you what. Why don't you just go without breakfast and give the money directly to Nigel Farage? Because that's where it's going.

Witherspoons, are you joking me? And That guy's a Tim Tim idiot who runs Witherspoons, the one who looks like father Jack. He is right in there with Aaron Banks and all that mob. And 08:00 in the morning, you can have a drink, and they and they are. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, there are many reasons to avoid Wetherspoons. For me, the number one is a political one. But, also, people in Witherspoons. Yeah.

Yeah. And they won't serve any foreign beer. It's all got to be British beer for British people. Fuck Witherspoon's. Let's put that in the book.

In fact, let's call the book Fuck Witherspoon's, the Jazz Butcher's Story. You don't mind you don't mind the swearing there? That will be appropriate and selected, particularly. Absolutely. Fuck where the cow, please, can we call it that?

Sorry. You were trying to tell me something about your breakfast. I beg your pardon. Nice breakfast. And, but I'm not as politically aware of, as about the pub as you are, obviously.

And, and, yes, people were getting, you know, drunk. Yep. Drunk by midmorning because they can be drinking from me. That's all. Because they can.

Yeah. It's like England where the sun comes out, and all fat men feel compelled to remove all upper body clothing and immediately start drinking Stella. What a shit place. Well, you hate Britain. Yes.

I do. We mentioned the performance of Hard at the tube or the tube. Didn't really talk much about this song. No. It's a silly song.

I quite like the old fake bank snake in her boyfriend's cake. But, yeah, I was in a funny frame of mind at the time. Yeah. It's the beginning of '86, isn't it? Yes.

It is. It's the beginning of eighty six. And, Yeah. It's it's for me, it's not particularly successful tune. It's a single?

Someone decided that's it's good enough to put it out as a single. Yeah. I'm not quite I think yeah. I mean, there I think possibly it was one of those ones where the demo was sufficiently badly recorded that it sounded kinda cool. Do you know what I was saying about, this modern thing of nothing left to chance and golden signal?

The magic surely lies actually in things getting fucked up and mashed up. I think it might have been a case where, like, the pathetic bedroom demo had that effect and made it sound like a better song than it was. Because when you got it under the clinical eye of Livingston Studios, which is a very dry, clean kind of studio, I don't think really the riffage kinda held up particularly well. Also, I didn't like the glockenspiel they had there. Didn't like the glockenspiel they had there one bit.

It didn't have proper sustain on it. I don't it it it looked really good. It looked like concert quality, but perhaps it was just, perhaps it was just the mallets we were using. I don't know. But it didn't I love the sound of the glockenspiel on Scandal in Bohemia, for example, which was only a little educational one about JABIC.

Couple of octaves. And the this was a a big old thing, you know, like a concert thing, but it just didn't have that resonance or sustain. A minor car, it has to be said. The engineer, Tony Harris, is a great bloke. He was really nice to work with.

But So is it like a one off recording, was it? Sorry? This This is a one off recording, just this song on its own or Well, we did a session to make the whole 12 inch. So we did that. We did party time.

We did grooving in the bus lane. I think that's probably just those three, I think. But you see, there's a thing with Livingston Studios, and we're not alone in this. It does your recordings there do somehow seem to come out very clean and dry. The weather profits, Piazza spent, made a record there for, this short lived Elevation thing, which was like Warner's Money and Alan McGee's A and R.

They made an album called Mayflower, and they they made that there. And they came away very disappointed feeling that it had come out somehow a lot flatter and a lot less rock than they actually sounded. REM recorded there around about the same time. I forget which album it might be fable of sort of the reconstruction, but I'm not that familiar with their work. But, again, I remember talking to Peter Buck about Livingstone, and he said, again, they felt that their stuff came out a bit dry.

So maybe the riff wasn't so bad, and it was just the the Livingstone factor. Or maybe, as I suspect, the riff just wasn't up to that much. It wasn't really capable of carrying the tune. There's a chance to go mental at the end there when you're playing it out loud because you did it on the tune. Yeah.

Yeah. And I I think we talked, didn't we, about how Jules Holland seems to take this as some kind of personal affront. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it was it was a jolly enough thing to play.

I mean, it it went over alright live as a general rule. But I can't I can't say I'm particularly fond of it as a as a song. The best the best thing on that EP is Vienna song, for my money. The version of Party Time was nice. We thought we should rerecord it because like that first version, you know, it's very compared to what was happening at the gigs, it was like a demo, really.

And old Ian Sturgis going walkabout on the bass as well. We just thought it would be worth recording it as we were now, you know, as the JBC. Yeah, that's that's nice. There's nothing wrong with that. And as I say, Tony was a smasher to work with, but there's something about that limit the Livingstone Place.

And it didn't just happen to us. You know? It it doesn't it somehow sounds as though it's not a big expensive 24 track, but sort of like a a boxy 16 track or something. I don't know. It's actually I mean, it's a really luxurious state of the art studio, but it's just something maybe it's just eighties recording techniques.

I don't know. Listed a couple of tracks from the spooky EP, Blame and Whitfield, Sarah, and the Birchfield Road Affair. Whitfield, Sarah, and the Birchfield Road Affair was literally made up on the spot. That's why I keep saying nothing at all all the time. Because it is nothing at all.

Literally made up on the spot for a Canadian radio session, CBC nineteen eighty '8. Kizzy, bless him, had got himself into a state and condition. What had happened, if I remember correctly, we'd got fixture congestion. And on the day that we were due to do this recording at the CBC in Montreal, I'd been double booked to go and do an hour or two's guest DJing on a local radio station. So we got in to the CBC.

We got established. And, pretty much immediately, it was time for me to split. So I said, well, look, guys. You know? Take your time.

Get a sound up. All that sort of thing. That all takes time. And, you know, once once you're ready to go, we're a band on tour. In the middle of a tour, we've been on tour all year, basically.

And, one thing that you do routinely at Soundcheck's is once you've got all the instruments up one by one, you play a song without the singing. So we were really good at that. We could play all our set without me singing them just for a nice instrumental balance, and then you add the vocals. You know? That's gig stuff.

So I had every confidence that they'd be able to bang out a version of, for example, Big Saturday was on the list, Grateful Annalette. That the young team would be able to bash those out. I'd go on the radio and be a bleeding personality, come back, and put the singing on. Donald. Well, I went away, went on the radio, came back to find kids face down on the studio floor, and Paul Lawrence sitting there and sort of and what are we to do now?

Sort of expression on their faces. So what we had to do then was just, like, fucking get busy and make stuff. And that's basically I can't remember if he sort of revived Kiss and got him onto some of the tracks or not, but it's basically a three piece made that made those songs. And, yeah, Sarah and Whitfield, Sarah was just made up. It was an idea that was running around in the back of my head for a possible short story.

And I couldn't really remember the short story, and I got all these looking at at me. And I've got headphones on, and I'm supposed to do something to the track now. So that's the music was just made up arbitrarily. Just jammed it out. And then the words just logorrhea over the top.

It's nothing. It's a puff. Similar thing happened, though, at the same session that was a lot more useful. Thinking that we're a bit light on stuff and not really knowing where to go, I sat down on my own and played this little tune, Girl Go. And that's for again, that was made up on the spot.

That was made up there in that room that night. And, of course, that went on to, have got a distinguished career in, in midfield. Blame? There was a night in Stuttgart on the eighty eight European tour in the spring where we had a night off in the Stuttgart hotel with the gig was the next day. And, we were just carousing, passing a leisurely evening with the old and so when we became excited because two coaches pulled up with Soviet plates and disgorged large numbers of grim faced Soviet Russians into the hotel.

Well, you didn't see too many Soviet Russians in Western Europe in AE 8. We grew excited, and we tried to communicate with our fellow socialists from across the divide. And just like they tell you in all those sort of dismissive documentaries where they lie through their teeth about all these different things, one one thing that they did have right was all the roosties were dead scared of talking to us. Now I'm not sure that that was because we were westerners. I think it may have had a lot to do with the fact that they'd probably never seen white people who looked like us before and were probably alarmed at our level of excitement and interest in their doings.

It's like, bloody hell. These these West German spots don't have look funny. So there we were chasing all these rooskis around the hotel. And, of course, into the bargain getting progressively drunker and stoned her. And I didn't witness it at the time.

I wasn't around. Yeah. Never mind what I was up to. In the room which Steve Malloy, our justice and security department, was sharing, There had been some excitement, and, one of the beds had gone out the window. I know traditionally, it's supposed to be televisions.

Right? But Steve's a big strong man. There's a reason we used to call him monster boy. And, yeah, somehow or other, a bed ended up going out the window. And I I think I still, somewhere, have a photograph of the aftermath with, like, Malloy, possibly Mulraney, or possibly Lawrence, one of the two, and some random German punky bird all piled on top of each other in the remaining bed in the morning.

And, of course, there was there was some there were reductions with the, with the establishment. As if we look at what form my bed is in the car park, that sort of thing. And, it was about that time that Mulraney came up with a brilliant plan. Oh, don't blame us. Blame me on the Libyans.

And so blame me on the Libyans became a right catchphrase. The little riff, the little five four riff, I think it owed a lot to Richard Formby, actually. Yeah. Richard did a thing just on a cassette, not not for release. Just did a thing, which is really sort of quite clean and major key and melodic.

But it had that five, ten, eight, if you like, thing. And, I kinda remembered it. And my idea, frankly, when we got into do the b side for Spooky at Greenhouse with her Higgins, my idea was to take that and, like, hang things off of that riff. But pretty much as soon as we started to play it, Paul just went into this, like, hyper sort of groovy, almost like a sort of five four drum and bass kind of deal. And, of course, Lawrence went chasing after him.

Because those two at that point, they were playing together every night. They were telepathically connected. And so the next thing I know, these guys are steaming away like a greyhound out of a trap. Kizzy's got the first tone on it. It's just going.

And any attempt to introduce Richard's pretty little riff, it's gone. Now in one way, this is good because it means we get the writing credit. But in another way, it's like, oh, well, now what's happening? And so the thing ran away, and it took on a life of its own. And, yeah, it was just well, it needs a lyric, and it's like, don't blame it on me.

Blame it on the Lippians. It just sat really well. And the the versey bits, it was '88. It was the summer. It was the twentieth anniversary of chucking rocks in gay Paris.

They were situationist riots. And so we hung the thread on that. On the idea of, like, the, you know, French people writing in the streets. And, just ran it from there, really, lyrically. Just ran it from there.

You know, things are getting out of hand. Things that I don't understand. Somebody caught rabies. You know? Just escalating paranoia.

Nice little breakdown. Little just pull Larry Larry holding it back. Like, he's just fuzzing. Nice little breakdown. And some really shitty Casio Istanbul traffic jam noises at the end from yours truly.

Yeah. I like I like blame. We did a version of that for the CBC session as well, which I don't think was really radically different from, the b side version. I can't it didn't get played a lot. I can't recall playing it out at gigs very much.

Though he might have done once or twice. Beautiful snow white hair, which is about O'Higgins. Yeah. That was a a long tour and a very mental one. Nine weeks, I think, in total, and it was hot.

And, at some point, Higgins, he's he's a very entertaining soul. He's he's a clever man, and sometimes he can do these very clever wind ups. I think it was on that same tour that he had a photograph of his newly born baby. And this photograph of his newly born baby was a horror photograph. The baby was being changed.

There was baby dump everywhere. The baby's sort of lying there with his legs in the air and trucking just a sea of baby dump. And what O'Higgins would do, he'd be having a drink with someone, or worse, he would do it at the dinner table. And say, oh, yes. Well, she's beautiful.

She's beautiful. Would you like to see a picture? And people go, oh, yes. Because you know what people like when someone has a baby. They're all fussy and congratulatory.

And, oh oh, yes. Oh, yes. It'd be lovely to see a picture of little Isabelle. Yes. No dickens would pull out this horror go to chrome job.

You know, they they they chose this particular color in Australia from the whole Pantone selection. They chose this particular color to to put on cigarette packets because it was supposed to be the most unattractive color available. Incorrect. I have seen the most unpleasant color available, and it was in O'Higgins's baby photograph. And so occasionally, omnibus conversations would that was the you know what?

The whole photograph business was 88. This, however, is 92. But baby talk would go on.

And one day, out of the blue, Higgins announced to general public without much fanfare. When I was a little baby, I used to have beautiful snow white hair. Well, occasionally, remarks would be made. Because I part part of the fun with O'Higgins is just being horrible to him. And, yeah, tart remarks would be made about beautiful snow white hair or someone would go, oi, snowy, or so forth.

And we got to the very last night of the tour, which was in a place called The Knick in Birmingham, Alabama. Hadn't been to Alabama before. You hear a lot about Alabama, don't you? You hear a lot about Birmingham, Alabama because that's where they shot fucking Martin Luther King, wasn't it? We just had an insane two and a half days in New Orleans, the Chilton Binge.

And we had to drive up to Alabama. We were all feeling a little bit fragile, and we're all feeling a little bit scared. And the Nick turned out to be a sort of large log cabin on the edge of town with, like, rather impressive motorcycles parked outside. Chicken wire. We weren't that panicked because Alex had said that he was gonna come up.

And we thought, well, if anyone can protect us in Birmingham, Alabama, it will be Alex children. We'll be alright. So we went in, tea time for a sound check, and sure enough, rednecks. You know, sort of Elvis Presley hairdos, the black shirts, the denim, rednecks. They didn't really pay us much mind.

We didn't really pay them much mind. It's a bit like alligators. You just everyone gets on with it. You know? It might have been a vague flicker of interest when the barman said, "we got a Pat Fish here?"

Yep. "I got Alex Chilton on the phone for you." I think one or two of them might have, like an eyebrow might have gone up a sixteenth of an inch. You know? And it was Alex on the dog, and he was going, like, I'm fucked.

I'm not coming up tonight. I said, that's cool. It was great seeing you. Bye. Went back to doing a sound check.

Rednecks everywhere. Can't even remember what we had for dinner, but I don't remember leaving the nick or going to a restaurant or anything. I think we probably just got, like, you know, carry out pizza or some kind of muck like that. And this is the last night of the tour. Right?

So it's not it's not shaping up too great. You know, we've done two shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles. We've done two shows with Jeff Buckley in New York. We've done Vancouver. We've done Chicago.

And now we're in this wooden shed in a city that has a rather scary and hostile reputation with a few rednecks at the bar while we're trying to soundcheck. Alex isn't coming. It's all a bit the potential is there for disappointment. Couple of spliffs in the car park. Wait.

What? Why don't we start tonight with a jam? What? Well, they're all rednecks. They won't be listening.

You know, I mean, this could be pointless. Why don't we just have some fun? And instead of starting off with, like, party time or something, why don't we just get up there and have a massive great one called Jam? Yeah. Right?

Yeah. You alright? Brilliant. Dave Whittemore was there, the website guy, with his little spaceship sports car type thing. And being the Internet crazy guy that he was, just general sort of sound scientist kind of chap, in his little spaceship car.

He'd somehow set up the capacity to broadcast. So he was he put his mics up. He'd been taping loads of the shows on that tour as Western Family prooves. And he set up his mics and actually sort of turned his car into a tiny radio station with a reach of about two or three miles. So we weren't just playing to the punters who turned up.

They turned up in reasonable numbers, actually. Didn't look too scary. But also broadcasting to anyone who's in the area, which is why there's a crack at the very top of that sort of I forget exactly what I say, but it's like, oh, you're on the radio. You wanna get down to Nick, my son? And it's literally the first song in the set.

It's literally Birmingham, Alabama. They are the rednecks that were there at tea time are still there, still drinking amongst the hipsters. And we start off with a shapeless one quart jam that lasts about seven minutes and concludes with me chanting, Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. I thought, well, in for a penny, in for a dollar.

You know? Not the slightest problem. Not the slightest problem. Played through the whole set. Increasingly warm applause.

Finished the set. Having a quiet drink. Uh-oh. Here comes one of the rednecks. This is a bit this is you know, everything's gone so smooth, and here comes a redneck.

You boys? You boys lack of breath, fresh air. Oh, that's very nice of you. And then he turns to Crouchy, and he goes Crouchy, he was, like, almost static on stage. Right?

Just plays. Turns around to Crouchy. He goes, you need to calm down, little son. So that is the story of beautiful Snow White Hero. It's basically an attempt to see if we could get ourselves shot.

And, you know, when all else failed, I tried the old. But, in the middle of it, we lift massively Spaceman 3 number, which is why the writing credits on there are so complicated because their writing credits were complicated enough. And then we sort of added stuff around it. But, yeah, I I rather like the version of Amen in the middle.

And you mentioned, German for in basket or something.

Yes. Yes. This is very in joke. On the autumn ninety one tour around Germany and Austria with Pete Astor, We stopped it may even have been the same shopping trip where we bought the wooden parrots on sticks. I bought a little card game whose exact nature was unclear because it was in German.

But it was a bit like happy families, and they were like suits of cards, all of which had pictures of puss cats on them. There was raub cats and predator cats. They had, like, leopards and tigers and lions, and there was, like, pears and with lots of long, woolly haired Persian cats. What was it? Oh, spiel something or the kitchen.

One of the sections was like playful kittens. Can't remember the word spiel something kitchen. And in this suite, there were, like, four cards. One was, which is a little puss cat with a huge slice of, like, Viennese cake with cream all over its mush. There was another one which caused endless amusement on the bus of a little shabby kitten with a plastic toy telephone.

And the immortal caption, telephone. My own telephone. This caused utter delight. And there was a further suit of four cards, which was kittens in baskets. And this was entitled, Imcorp.

So when Higgins was a baby, they kept him in a basket, so he lived Imcorp. And that's what that is. You can honestly, I mean, like, probably, like, £1.50 for a little card game. You've got no idea how much joy and amusement it brought us. Getting towards the bottom of this list of 12.

Excellent. Is is that from the basement sessions? So it's a go go b side, is it? Yes. That was, that was indeed from the basement sessions, and that marks the last recorded appearance of poor old kids before he goes down.

We managed to get a little bit of heavy metal guitar out of him. And, also, we got him just for one breakdown on his own just going, excellent. That's kiss. Yeah. Poor guy.

He got a trench in his head. He was fucking medicated off his chump. He didn't know what was going on, but we got that out of him. But that that that is his last yeah. That's his drug band Blues, God of Us.

Yeah. Awful times. Awful times. But the song itself, it was, I suppose, the result of a sort of survey. We took the instruction book for the, for the album that we had with us, and we just started writing down things that we liked.

It's as simple as that. It's just a list of things that we could use a case of. And the lyric gets passed around proper rap style. You know, different people get different lines. And I find Mulraney particularly very convincing.

There's there's almost a touch of the endures when he goes, Camel filters in the box. So yeah. I mean, it was I don't think there was ever any intention of putting it on the album, but it's hard to say because, you know, I'd we've said before with the whole thing with Basement, we were after sprawling. And there are things that were gonna be recorded that I can remember that never got recorded. Like the little, the little sort of do what chorus of.

Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.

Love. Love. Little things like that. They've never even made it to tape, but excellent obviously did. And right at the end, you just hear Richard Formby's only vocal contribution.

It just goes to Giles Gilbert Scott 1926 g series public telephone kiosk With that same tone of satisfaction that you hear from Ida when he goes, drum bone. It's like, yes. We've got it on the record. And lastly, vodka girls. Everything in this world is cheap and nasty.

Everything in this world is cursed and vile. It's called vile's sister, Kirsten. It was done at the Love Bus sessions. It was one of the four that didn't make it onto Love Bus, wasn't it? There was that.

There's cat brand meditation. There was I never know when to say when, which was uncle Dave's birthday present. And there was an initial version of Trucco Fear. Oh, and there were also covers of Everybody's Talking and Over the Rainbow as well. Well, we were there for a long time.

I don't really know what to say about Vodka Girls. The it's it it has things in common with killed out from that session. In the rather than playing chords or tunes on the guitars, it's just like it's a bit more Jackson Pollock than that. It's just like throwing guitar noise at the track and just splattering it in sort of hostile guitars. Yeah.

I'm blowing up my ugly balloon Round at Richard's one night after work, getting high, and looking at his Minnie the Minx annual. And one of the cartoons began with Minnie blowing up this balloon, and she goes, alright, readers? I'm blowing up my ugly balloon. A few good blows, and I can have some laughs. So that's where that's lifted from.

It's a song of general hostility towards are you familiar with Bridge Street of a Friday night? But, presumably, you've seen shows on telly of, like, drunk birds with their knickers around their ankles, throwing up on policemen on Cardiff High Street. That sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah.

There's that line, Rope like Fergie Rope like something. Fergie and a nightmare. Cardboard hair. And REM, good god. It was a time when REM had started having hits.

Like, they were losing their religion and so forth. And, you would see, you know, these these these pissed up girls in mini dresses with cardboard sort of Carol Decker hair. And, you know, REM would be playing, and and and they'd be slight sloshing about with their brightly colored alcopops, and you would just be left culturally confused. I came to the conclusion that one good thing to do would be just to, like, detonate the thing. So, of course, at the end of the song, that's exactly what we do.

You can practically hear the plunger go down. And, again, Richard Formby and the, Rosemary Davis series hard at work there. As the explosion goes off, we dropped in, the sound of, polite applause from a county cricket match. And, also a couple of sheep. A good match.

Yeah. Yeah. But it yeah. It's just just one of those sort of it has things in common with, say, Chicken Town. It's just screaming abuse at people for being vulgar, which is quite funny, really, because screaming abuse is quite vulgar.

And that concludes, if we have to write a concordance, the, 208 or whatever I said there was. 208. Okay. I've got you. I've got you straight away.

We didn't cover thing, which lurks on the end of the hard EP. And we didn't cover City of Night, which is on 50,000 glass fence. Can't be wrong. Possibly not. Yeah.

Did we do a session on Gift of Music volume two? Big question, No. Because if we did, we might have covered some of these there. Yeah. Quite tricky to search for thing.

Try City of Night. That's pretty, pretty easy to pull up. I'll make you another cup of tea. Yeah. City of Night, I think.

You got something on that? Yeah. City of Night would sit on that as well. Sorry? I'm saying, sir, you said earlier City of the City of Night began as an instrumental very much along the lines of Monkeyface Yep.

On the four track. So we have covered it? Yeah. It was never it was never on four track. I'll cut you up at, Bugbrook.

Raul has developed a slightly more complicated, title. Thank you. Really? Yeah. A little while ago, I finally bit the bullet, plugged the power supply into Russell's drum machine, and watched to see if it would blow up or break everything, and it didn't.

So shortly thereafter, I got it wired up to the four track and started running little, experimental little jams. Your man here got up on the desk, and the drum machine was running, but it was coming out through headphones. And I caught him up against the headphones going, what's that? So I opened him up for him so he could hear it. And he's like, oh, what's that?

So it's drums. Look. The drums come out of that box there, go down this wire, they go through that, and they come out down this one here into these. And you're hearing that thing going through there, coming out here. And he's like, very sage.

He's like, yes. And he has another little listen to the drums. Yes. He then curls up on the desk right next door to all the recording kit and stays there throughout the evening. So he's not he's no longer number one top chief assistant.

He is now, deep breath, number one top chief assistant recording engineer. Yeah. And has to be addressed thus, don't you? Yes. I do.

We have, we have the song about having sex with an hoover. That's the one. Yep. Dodges assholes. Yeah.

I mean, I was thinking in the kitchen. I was thinking all that really needs to be said about that thing is this is a song about a man having sex with a hoover. Talk about Kip. He wanted to do little dark songs like Kip and S. That's on the box of green.

Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. It has a lot in common with that because it's kind of blues based, isn't it? So, yeah, I think we covered that.

So Excellent. To my knowledge, that is 208, more or less covered in the manner that we have been covering them. I have to sort of I wanna catch you out on something. I wanna find something you've missed. So, I wanted to how long have we got?

Probably only until three in the morning because I've then gotta get up and go to London. Yeah. Briefly canter through the last eight years, if only in the manner that we have been previously to get some set some context to new songs. 2012 to now? Yes.

So Whoosh. I mentioned 2012. So we'll do it in a canter if we can. Okay. Well, Gent gents, So when when Gents events finish, you you then almost straight off or about the same time you have the Wilson DVD launch, and then you have a few other That that actually happened in the middle of making Genadvent.

That weekend with, the trip the Wilson rehearsals, the trip to Bils, doing me back in with the drum train, playing the pitch drum for the DVD release, that was all right in the middle over a weekend of the recording session. We got Genadvent finished, mastered, pressed, boxed up, and shipped to us by the end of that 02/2012. And we were rather overtaken by events because before we could even get it out, Tetsuya Nakatani over at Vinyl Japan in Tokyo said, oh, Patton Max come and play Japan. Yes. And so you remember that the whole point of making Jet an Advent was to get some adventures traveling the world.

Right? Well, it started to come true even before the thing had come out. It was enough it was enough word that people had heard that we were recording again. It was obviously enough to get the Japanese fans up and going. And so we went over there, which is very agreeable.

The next year, what happened, I just Solo in Brussels. Brussels. Yeah. And Hamburg and Dortmund with with Truax, all of those. Ah, now that that's small beast.

That's that's entirely its own thing. God. That's a chapter of its own. That is Small Beast was the brainchild of Paul Wolfish. Have we talked about Paul?

Very interesting man. Comes from a very, very musical family. One of his elderly female relatives played cello for her life in Auschwitz. I've started to think of the news recently, obviously, with this seventy fifth Auschwitz thing, about a cellist who is still alive, I think. Lady cellist?

Yeah. Could well be Paul's auntie, grandma, whatever she is. Could well be. But the whole family had, like, obscenely musical. Dad was like or is like some kind of famous conductor or something, and Paul can play everything.

And he's very well connected. At this time in 02/2013, he was the musical director at the Schauspiel House in Dortmund, which is how we got to play there. But he had this club called Small Beast, and every month he would invite in a guest artist and then sort of build a show around. Yes. I'm listening.

I was just looking up Anita Laska Valfish. Yeah. She's the cellist. Yeah. Yeah.

They're Romanian Jews originally. She's still alive. 94 years old. Yeah. Wow.

Yeah. Well, that that's that's some relation, of course. And, yeah, I mean, he is effectively a Romanian Jew from New York, but he spends a lot of time traveling the world doing various music projects because he's a hell of an instrumentalist. He was there, when we were trying to record Mickey in Prague. Dave Jay got him over.

And so this club, he has small beast guest artist every month. And in fact, the month before us, he'd had Dave Jay. And then he got in touch with me, and he said, listen. I wanna do something a little different for Small Beast. I wanna get you and Truax and Marcus Maria Janssen from this German band, m Walking on the Water, who I knew we'd do it together before.

And I want to build an imaginary band called the Almost Hasbings. And so we did. I went over there about a week before his dates. We had a date in Hamburg, and we had a date in Dortmund. And we went over there.

And in a week, we invented a set for this imaginary band. And it was flat it was mental. Absolutely mental. Marcus is a singer songwriter who plays guitar. I'm a singer songwriter who plays guitar.

Truex is a singer songwriter who builds mad instruments and plays guitar. And Paul plays the piano and guitar. Great. So we've got four people. We've got four good musicians with God knows how much professional experience behind them.

But we've got no drummer or bass player. Well, we've got Mother Superior, True Axis Machine, but that ain't gonna work on everything. And so it was spectacular. Even I got a go on the drums one. I mean, if I had to play drum and bass on the same number.

Just sitting there going boom boom boom and playing bass. Absolutely stupid. Yeah. And we just did we just did the two dates. One in Hamburg and one in Dortmund.

It was the whole thing was a little strange because in the rehearsal run up, Marcus's little brother went and died. And the trip to the venue in Hamburg took us on the road right past Little Brother's flat. So Marcus was there. His sister came to see him. And, of course, they were both in pieces.

And Marcus has this song, We'll see each other in heaven. So he carried on playing Heavy. Yeah. I mean, his solo set in Hamburg was of necessity, brief, and dark. But in the band set, we did this number.

Thomas was on the drums. Paul was on the piano. I was on the bass, and Marcus was singing and playing guitar. Fuck. That was charged.

That was really, really charged both nights. When we got back to Dortmund the second night, being the troop of the years, Marcus had kind of bust through to the other side and delivered a really charming and cheerful and entertaining set. But even so, when we did that, that same song at the end of that night, heavy. Great fun. Great heavy, dark, reasonably luxurious fun.

You take you're sparked up. I noticed from the pictures around 2013, you're wearing a suit and tie in sort of habitually at gigs around that sort of time. And It started around 02/2010. I think it probably started a gig I did in, Hoxton. But it it matters very little.

I'd seen some pictures of Dave Jay that he'd had taken publicity shots, and he got himself all suited and booted. And I thought, that looks good on a man of a certain age. And it wasn't as though I didn't have the suits. And, it was also sort of like Wilson. You know, Wilson, it really didn't matter too much what you look like in Wilson.

Though, actually, if you look at the DVD 2,009 with Wilson, I'm wearing a suit. So, you know, it's it's it's something I've always done, to be honest with you, since God since the start of the nineties. I I I used to go out and get a tour suit, like, '89, 9092. I was wearing suits back then. So I'd I'd I'd don't think that's a huge thing.

But the sort of slightly cleaner, cleaned up sort of look, yeah, that that comes around 02/2010. And, and you're you're playing some local geese again, some with a full band that featured on Gents and Bents. And then you go to New York for a couple of New York days with Max. That's right. Yeah.

And I see some pictures of some busking going on or maybe ad hoc singing in the street with guitar. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I do that quite a lot, actually. If it's a nice day and it's sound check time and there's nothing going on in there, but, you know, someone's miking something up or wiring something up or whatever, There's nothing for me to do, but I've got my guitar out of the case.

I've tuned it up. I'll just go find a quiet place and have a little strum, you know. And sometimes that quiet place is in the street. Get pennies thrown much. Punches?

Yeah. Pennies, not so much. Sometimes, though, it's like it's, you know, somebody says, oh, can we come outside and take photographs? And, again, you have your guitar. So, you know, you just end up getting photographed with the guitar.

Did you see Leto Velez's painting? I'll show that to you. It's nice. It's it's taken from a photo that was taken outside the club in Brooklyn in 02/2013, and Leto's kind of turned into a sort of digital painting. It's really kinda cool.

1314 seemed like a quiet winter, but then there were some solo dates. And then the the Jazz Butcher Well lounge quartet appear. Yes. You see the end of the end of 13. We'd you know, in a in a in a short year, we've done Japan, America, Belgium, Germany, and some English dates.

So we've largely achieved what we've wanted to do with GENTA Advent. Plus, you know, we accidentally made a good record into the bargain, so that was kinda nice. But by the end of 02/2013, that was pretty much done. And the last gig I did in 2013 was with Venus Flytrap and Kevin Hewick up in Leicester at the Musician. The Musician is what you might call a destination venue.

There's not gonna be anyone walking in off the street, not where it is. It was by this empty municipal car park on a foggy, dismal, drizzly night. And, I had something like £1.79 in my pocket. I actually had to buy half of Guinness. And I was outside the front smoking pretty much my last spliff, and there's about 10 people in the venue.

And I'm thinking, fishy, I reckon you've had your lot, son. You've been, like, around the world two or three times. You've had loads of money in good times. And, frankly, mate, if you look where if you look where you're at now, it's pretty much where you started out, playing to 10 people in some obscure provincial nowhere sort of venue. Having said that, it has to be said the Musician is actually a very nice venue and very well run.

And they didn't even complain that we didn't pull anybody. They were very nice to us. But at the time, with, like, $1.79 in your pocket, half a Guinness, and a fucking half a spliff left, watching this empty car park fail to fill up, it felt like the end. And as 2014 dawned, Russell got in touch with me, Russ Cooper, and said, oh, I have a friend. She's opening a gin parlola, and she wants me to book bands for it and that.

But I really can't be bothered. I'm too busy. Do you fancy it? And I said yes because I thought that my music making days were done, and I would need some any little way of scrambling in a few quid. So I said yes.

And I went and had a meeting with Sue, and it didn't the lady with the gin parlor, that is. And it didn't really make a lot of sense, and I didn't hold out a lot of hope. But I did put out some feelers. I put out some feelers to a drummer I knew called Steve Gruffler. I said, Jill, how do you feel about the idea of, like, playing in the corner of a gin parlor where all these fabulous idiots are ignoring what you're playing and getting paid for it?

And Steve Gruff said, well, with you, which was something I hadn't anticipated. I thought I was just a fixer here. Later that same week, I was having a joint with Steve New, And I said the same thing. Steve, you you you're the kind of guy. You're you're a musical kind of guy.

You know the jazz and that. There's there's this there's this possible gig. You might, you know, might be able to make a few bob. Anyway, well, with you, it was all it it all had that kind of strange feeling like the beginning of Wilson. It's like, why are all these people suddenly talking about playing with me?

They've never shown any interest before. You know? And, as a result of these misunderstandings, it was agreed that we'd meet around Stevie g's house at the end of the street at the barbershop and have a jam just for fun. And we did. And when the three of us were in a room together, obviously, Steve and Steve, they go way back.

They've been playing together since 1983. So they are just down. And it turns out that them and me are really good fit. And it also turns out that when I gave Stevie g a copy of Genent Event, just being sociable, that blessing me had gone and learned all the songs. So it was from the word from absolutely the first moment, it felt like a really great fit.

We just sat down and started playing things. And I remember making a crack about chemtrails, and Steve New's face just lighting up and going, chemtrails? Go on. You intrigue me. And so very, very quickly, we had a little thing going on, and we started doing it every Thursday.

We called it Thursday club. And after a few weeks, Steve said, oh, I've got this mate from the boats when he used to work on the ships. He's a trumpet player. Can I bring him down for a jam? And we went, yeah.

That turned out to be Simon Taylor. And we did a couple of gigs, and we did a couple of demo recordings at Steve's nephew's place. And it's sort of accidentally by by by the 2014, I appeared accidentally to have a whole new kind of band. And we used to rehearse in Steve's Kitchen in just, like, you know, in the terrace row. So, like, we didn't play loud.

And this ability to play very softly turned out really handy because it meant we could play anywhere. We with the first gig we did, we were at the Lamplighter upstairs. Were you there? It might have been. Yeah.

It'd have been about June 2014, and it was the it was the quartet. And we'd made up our minds that we were trying to we weren't gonna try and do the big rock show. We were gonna try and export the kitchen experience into a room with punches. And so we actually played that night without any PA. I think we did have tiny little practice amps for the guitar and the bass.

But beyond that, I was just singing out into the room. Simon was just playing his trumpet. The drums weren't mic'd up. And we we we got away with that. We we finished with a version of Quality People.

And, so it it just seemed that this thing had legs. And so we started going out more and more, and people just were people were really positive about it from all sorts. So Rolo was right into it, for example. A geyser I'd known since 1983 had us play his birthday party. Didn't know what he was ordering.

Got it delivered to his house. We did the job in his house. Big house. Yeah. Did the job in his house, And he was delighted as were all his pals.

And at the end of the night, he said to me, you know, you've had this daft name for God knows how many years. It's it's almost like you've grown into it. And so the quartet existed. And that existed up to the '18 when it just sort of evaporated. I mean, the real the real problem with it was in February 16 when Stevie Gruffalo died.

That's what really made it hard. And we tried a few things after that. We had Pat Keneally from the Lords of Time on drums for a couple of dates. Then we hooked up with Tim Harris's son, Joel Yeah. Who became, like, pretty much the regular guy for that that time.

And is indeed is still sort of a member of the continuity JBC, which is a sort of emergency emergency band that we dig out if we have to. The family rhythm section of Joel and Tim. But, yeah, it it never really quite survived the demise of Stevie because he was the heart of the group, not just musically as a drummer, but socially as well. You know, it was his place where we rehearsed, his Dolce Vita that we enjoyed, his connection with Steve New that kind of, like, glued all the relationships in the band together. And There are there are various sort of incarnations of that quartet, and it even sort of evolved into a quintet at one point in it.

And I think, so Max occasionally would join that outfit. I think on occasion, Joe might. Max had a go in the 2000 he retired. Yeah. Yeah.

The two well, yeah. They led to his retirement. It and that's that's that's what took it out of him was those dates. 2014. Simon had only just been grafted on.

So rather rudely, I insisted that he sit that out because I didn't fancy the idea of Simon freestyling his trumpet and Max with his studied guitar parts just having train crashes every three and a half seconds. So I'd I'd told Simon to sit that one out. And, yeah, we did those just a couple of dates with Max, and then Max was done. Bless him. So we ended up doing Brighton as a trio.

And, in '14 as well, you went to Tokyo for the third time with Pete. With Pete Astor. Yeah. And the monochrome set. That was quite odd, actually, because when we were little kids in the Sonic Tonics back in about 1980 or '81, We went to see the monochrome set.

We like the monochrome set. We went to see them at this venue in Oxford. And I can remember me and John Silver going into their dressing room and very sheepishly handing them a demo cassette of Sonic Tonics and shuffling away very quickly from the scary pop stars. And all those years later, I found myself in, I think it was yeah. It was.

It was in Shumo. It was in Shumo, Kitu Sawa, In a club there. Sound check time. Waiting around as you do. Sitting on a table in the club, playing my acoustic, having a jam with bid from the monochrome set.

The same guy that I'd nervously handed this cassette to about a hundred and four years ago. And there there we are, having a jam. Pals. So that, honestly, was a bigger thrill than you might imagine. Is that the third and last time you've been to Japan?

Is that, the Yeah. I think so. Yeah. It was kind of diminishing returns thing, Japan. The first time we went out, we went out, like, four piece band and loads of mates.

Second time, we went out, me and Max, missus Max, couple of mate. Oh, because Stuart Moxon was along as well from Young Marble Giants, and he brought a mate along who could speak Japanese. So we again, we're quite a big posse. And then by 02/2014, they've got it down to just fishy. You know?

But it was, you know, it was good fun being with Pete, and, it was good to get to know the monochrome set a bit as well. The various incarnations of the quartet are playing in places like Spain, and you have in fifteen seven dates in France. Yeah. And which seemed like quite an extended little tour? That that was kind of like we all knew.

Everyone in the quartet knew that that trip was either gonna make us or break us. It was all very improvised. Some of the gigs were, like, in villages. And, it was all very enjoyable, but even so, it wasn't quite certain. Even as even as we were doing it, it wasn't quite certain what the effect on the band was gonna be.

And then we got to Bordeaux. And, of course, in Bordeaux, it's a town with record shops and radio stations and people who know the words to jazz butcher songs and shit. And the response we got there just lifted things. We did this, there's a second Bordeaux gig. We we did the official one.

That was kinda good. But we had a spare day, and we was literally just asking the punters around the evening. You know? Like, yeah. Anywhere we could play on, say, Saturday or Sunday?

And someone said, yeah. Come play my flat on Sunday. And he was one of these guys. He does house concerts. It's quite a thing in France.

They do it a lot. The fellow who put me on in that theater in in the South Of Paris in September, he has got gigs in his living room as well. I mean, he at least he got us a proper venue. But he does have gigs in his living room. And we we did this living room gig in in Bordeaux, and it was insane.

It was it was so hot. I think I've seen a bit of film of it. There's footage of it. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. And so for all that tour was held together with, like, bits of plaster and funded with money we found down the back of the sofa. It was it was very good for us. And, yeah, we felt at that point as though nothing could hurt us. And indeed, by the 2015, we'd even, got ourselves some kind of an agent.

And, we did a run at the 2015. And, we got into two Steve had a way Steve had a routine in his life. He would take January off, and he would go to Thailand. He knew people in a village, and he would just go and live, like, with the natives in a village, way away from Bangkok and all that nonsense. Just go and sit quietly in a place where elephants would walk down the street.

You know? And he went away for that January 2016. He came back. And we just had a couple of meetings and starting to get it together again. And then on League Cup final day, he expired.

And it was never quite the same after that. There wasn't the center of gravity. I mean, we still did some good shows in that. We started getting more electric as well. Simon started getting to use well, he'd started getting into using effects on that French tour.

And, yeah, there were there were moments. But that explains why 2016 was a dead quiet year because Yeah. We didn't do very much at all. We did one show at the lamp with Pat on drums, and we did a show out at Bottey's Chateau. Yeah.

You played at party here. Yeah. That was insane. That was absolutely insane. I swear to God, Pat nearly was playing his drums.

We were all the hospitality was insane. By the time we actually got on, they kept delaying it because the the the party people were lingering over their dinner. So, oh, just another forty minutes, lads. More brandies. More spliff.

More beer. More wine. And even when we got on to start, we were, like, pretty shaky. And I can remember there's a moment in the second set where I looked around at Pat Keneally. And it was visible.

You could see it that he was following us. You know? He was watching us like a hawk, and you could see him go for the ride. Say, oh, no. Hi, Han.

You know, making his decisions as he went. And it's a tribute to how sharp that man is that it all sounded perfectly groovy. It didn't sound like the guitars and the bass were leaving the drums at all. It sounded like he was doing his job and driving it. But the truth is, I could tell he was, like, making it up as he went along.

So sharp. And, we've talked about the, you know, the dates as we as we go into '17 with the drummers off the subs bench, you might say. Joel and Dave Morgan, I noted. And you're supporting Jasmine Minx for a few dates and Yes. And David Jay.

And you you did a couple of dates in Scotland with Jasmine Minx. I think solo dates. Yes. We wanted to do it with the band, but, there were just too many problems. And it's just as well that we didn't either because, especially in Glasgow, lovely venue, lovely gig, like a church, Beautiful night.

But that didn't stop them trying to juke me over the money. Jim from the Jasmine's sorted that one out. But had we gone as a band, we would have dropped hundreds. So it's just as well. We did it the way we did.

Basically, I just I just attached myself to the Minx touring operation, and I was just kind of parasite. I said to I said to the audience in Aberdeen, I said, my name is Pat Fish, and my chief function here is to make myself a nuisance to the jasmine rings. And, when, just as a sort of side note, tell us a little bit about Drones Club. When were the were they formed about then? Or Drones Club's been around for quite a long time.

Actually, before I was involved, Steve New was in it. Right. They started I was there when Russ and Ian met, but I didn't get involved because, obviously, I thought I've got my own thing going on. And, Steve knew how to go at joining them on base, and they had a cellist as well. But nobody really knew what was going on, and it didn't really come to anything.

And so they all drifted away. And, Russ came to me and said, look. Would would would you give it a go playing bass? And I started going to these rehearsals, and I didn't have a clue what was going on either. And And I suppose somewhere around about the fourth or the fifth time we played, maybe maybe it was longer.

I don't know. But I can remember Ian brought this one tune in, and we couldn't understand. He's just playing it on bagpipes, and his foot's tapping, but it has no relevance that I can make out to what he's playing. And I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with this. You know, I'm getting borderline annoyed.

It's just like, mate, what? What are you trying to tell me here? Use your words like a big boy. And it eventually emerged that this tune that Ian was trying to play us basically went along the lines of very little Well, at this point, I looked at Russell, and Russell looked at me and we well, something must be done. So we kind of converted it.

We took the and we kinda took it into a sort of Tom White's Rain Dogs kind of much more swingy sort of thing. I found this kind of African type bass line. I was thinking of Tenerium. You know those guys? Oh, very good group.

They're like the sort of Sahara version of Spacemen three. And they really are hard Sahara men. They they ride around on camels with guns. That's their home life. They're not wanted anywhere.

They don't belong to any particular country. They're nomads. And everybody basically hates them. And they've just got this amazing desert blues band with electric guitars and everything. And, yeah, I was inspired by that.

And it was a kind of a moment because at that point, Russell and I were kind of dictating the rhythms to Ian, and he had just to play whatever he wanted to play. He was gonna have to play over that. And I think that was probably the dawn of the modern drones club, though it didn't really get good until Stevie Gordon joined us on guitar. That was Russ's idea, and it was an inspired idea. It just made the thing so much more solid.

I mean, you had Russ clattering away on his Durabooka. You had Ian honking and squalling on his bagpipes. And in between, you had me with a bass guitar, and it was almost as though I had to be the band. I had to supply all the music. So I was playing bass lines that were much busier than I really wanted to.

It wasn't that I couldn't play them. It was I just felt that I looked like a prick playing that much bass. And, of course, when the guitar comes in, I can ease right off, and we can support each other. And, also, I've got a brother in structure now. You know, both Russ and Ian would just kind of plow along their own sweet ways, and you never quite knew when things were gonna start, finish, or change.

And I was trying to impose that by, like, doing regular numbers of different bass parts, you know, and try and give it some shape. But it was only really when Steve was sitting there on guitars and understood as well that the songs really started to have some dynamic to them. You know? I really like it now. I'm really into it at the minute.

Raul was on the way out. Oh, he's just waiting for the doormen. Ah, yes. Time to go to work. You are good there.

Excuse me just for a minute. Yeah. Sorry about me. You meant, of course, to see doctor Goingback. I beg your pardon?

Doctor Going Back. Doctor Going Back. Yes. I but I especially like losses, lights, loves. That's that's quite a that's quite a good one.

I think that you're quite lucky to get losses, lights, loves. Yeah. I guess. Triple l. I was going to mention, twenty nineteen hundred club.

There was something it may have been to do with the fire records rereleases launch, one of the hundred club things, and and and and something on that something about the and the kids don't don't don't the kids just love it rather. This sort of seemed to be a super super group thing that happened in the hundred club again. That was interesting. This is eighteen, I think. Yeah.

Eighteen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You see, eighteen, Fire got on to AGMP, Adrian Gibson Music Productions, and organized a gig at the hundred club for us.

And, with our perennial drama problems, Steve knew that he'd solved them. He bumped into an old acquaintance who played piano, who turned out to be a big jazz butcher fan. Mhmm. This is Nick Vandy. Yes.

And with him came Lee Brooks, the drummer. A drummer of great intelligence, sensitivity, and above all, economy. We went we we did that gig at the hundred club in March with them, and that was the start of the quintet. And it was Bandy, of course, who delights in the opening sort of Mark Smith organ. Yes.

He loves doing his. That was extraordinary. That was an Arctic night. There were people from London phoning up saying they weren't coming because it was too hard to travel. It's like, yeah.

We're coming from Leicester. Right? But despite this, the hundred club was full. I think I was there. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Extraordinary turnout. We did that, and then we did another one at the hundred club shortly afterwards supporting a group called Bevis Frond, which is Nick Salomon and his psychedelic warlords. That gig was a logistical nightmare and not very enjoyable.

And I think oh, we did a we did a quintet show also for the Labour Party at the at the Labour Club, for which we were handsomely rewarded. That was with, John Higley. Oh, yes. I think I was there. I think you were.

Yeah. Yeah. You But I think He was funny. Yeah. He's good.

Always liked him. But I think, really, just that handful of dates. The next one that was coming up was Bristol. But at that moment, it just evaporated. I mean, having a five piece was hard.

Having a five piece with three of them living in one town and two in another was really hard. And I think that Steven Simon is sort of, like, just getting tired of it. And I'd have to admit it was getting to be a bit of a thing. But we've got this gig booked in Bristol. And, like, nobody fell out.

There's no screaming matches. There was no decisions or handshakes or anything. The group literally just evaporated. But I knew that people had bought tickets for the Bristol show, and I knew that some of them were coming from far away, like Wales, Germany, and things like that. Mhmm.

So I didn't wanna blow it out. And that's when the continuity JBC came in. Joel on the drums. Tim on the bass. Joe Wooley on the guitar.

Couple of practices here. One afternoon, we're in here. We're playing that song, Last of the Gentleman Adventures. Joe's really got the guitar part down. Sweet sound.

And there's a knock at the door. Boom. Boom. Boom. Excuse me.

I did chaps. Go and answer the door, and there's Liam who owns the place next door, which at the time, he was busy turning into a cafe. Lingos, show your music. Okay. Yeah.

Yes. It's really good. The first time in my life, the neighbors are banging on the door. Not to tell us. Moment.

Yeah. Exactly. Extraordinary. And, yeah, we took that down to Bristol. There's a DVD of it, actually.

It's it's quite funny because, it's not you know my thing. Work with what you've got. Work with who you've got. It's nothing like what we were doing just a few weeks before. It's much more you know, it's got more in common with, like, 1989.

And being aware that you can't always get hold of the likes of Tim and Joel because they're so busy. I figured, well, this could well be the last time I play a gig with a band. So I say to him at the end of the at the end of the gig, just before the last number, I say to the punters, look. This this could well be the last time you see me with a band. So, as they say in football, leave nothing upon the pitch.

I think I might have seen a a film of this on YouTube of Solar Core. It is on YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Going Ends up with Joe on his knees going.

Yeah. You're having a good go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

And and I suppose it I've got the whole gig now. In in '19, you're busy being ill for a bit, but it doesn't show too much because you're still doing the odd show solo. Well, the way the way the illness thing worked, just for the record, I was diagnosed in October, which looking back means that I probably had cancer for about two years at that point. I was whisked in the hospital and mucked around. My cancer treatment started in January, and it finished mid February.

I think it finished on Valentine's Day. I think it finished on February 14. And then on the February 21, I was around at Colin Henney's house doing that little, Internet broadcast thing with the covers. So it was pretty much get straight back on the bike. Yeah.

And you were you went you did one in Valencia as well? Yeah. I went before that, I went to Brighton. Did a show there with Helen McCookery book and the Aspos. Yeah.

And then, yes, again, Valencia was, booked. And, you know, you don't really wanna pass it up. I had I had some Bordeaux dates booked for just after Valencia. And we did Valencia, and it was great. But coming back was a struggle.

The journey home was a struggle. So I phoned up Bordeaux after that and said, look. I'm not coming. I'll I'll do you later. Because I was still feeling a bit under the weather right then.

I've got radiation bones up my ass. But, yeah, really, from from Valencia on, you know, it's it's it's a slow process of getting back on the bike. And by the autumn, you can see I'm out quite a lot. Yeah. And sort of will, in the meantime, sort of blew your cover a bit.

And Yeah. I mean, it's I I felt quite embarrassed and uncomfortable about all that because, you know, because Americans Yeah. You know, they they have to do fundraisers just to get treated. And I got all my treatment for nothing. So I was arguing with Willie all night.

I was saying, isn't this a slap in the face to those Americans? You know, you have to pay for their treatment. And he goes, ah, fuck it. And I was really very creepy about the whole thing. Until just in the conversation, we stumbled across the phrase, cash from cancer.

And we looked at each other, and we thought, yeah. Let's do it. At that point, I thought we were just gonna do the benefit gig. I didn't realize there was gonna be all this online money racing. But he said I mean, he rescued me from destitution with that.

You are such a clever pencil. That's a that was a proper sort of little little three port tap. Quite audible, wasn't it? Discreet. Yeah.

He was sitting on the doorstep showing no sign of coming in. I said, hey, mate. We've got we've got a train of thought going on here, and he just turned around and walked in. So clever. And yeah.

So I think, you know, if you needed rescuing, I think that was a well intentioned right thing to do. And and it was a it was a good, if if not slightly surreal night, wasn't it? I enjoyed it a lot. Not as much as, as old, Greeny did. Oh, no.

Mick had come pre enjoyed. I remember some you know, I mean, it there he was sitting there looking at a guitar like he'd never seen one before. You know? And, I forget who it was, but someone trying to sort of make the best of things said, oh, yeah. But he's a professional.

And I said, no. Cosworth is a professional. Because Cosworth could be wake up in the wrong town, terrible hangover, try to drink it off, get absolutely plastered, turn up with five minutes until he's due on stage, and still play guitar beautifully in tune and sing beautiful songs. Because Kursworth is a professional. Mick bless him that night was not a professional.

He had let circumstances get the better of him. And then as you said, do you manage to get out, you know, out, you know, going to Paris and other places? And I and you're sort of digging out some back catalog numbers that you haven't played for many years and sort of there's a Well, some of them I'd never played. Keeping the curtains closed, I'd never played that out live until then. And that Baltic song.

It was funny because I I might have said this to you before, but, when the love bus was released, a French journalist in a French magazine reviewed it. And went, ah, and one of the great moments of the SAP is boutique, where the guitar sounds almost like a harpsichord. Yes, love. That's because it is a harpsichord. This popped into my mind when Paris was on horizon.

I was thinking of songs. I thought, French people might like that. I might do that one. And to my astonishment, I found that it was actually it's quite easy to, come up with a solo version of it that sounds half alright. So I did it, and I got back home.

And then I saw some French person had reviewed it in some fanzine or other or something. And they put, as a highlight of the evening was when he plays. So, you know, I don't always get it wrong. Yeah. Maybe, if by that stage, we're having long conversations about your backpack catalogs, it's making you think of it.

I don't know. Excuse me one sec. Yeah. I'm gonna spend a penny as well. That's such a plain gift.

Come on here, man. Junomelt. Junomelt. Junomelt. Junomelt.

Tuna melt. Tuna, tuna. It's all about tuna. We got the tuna for a row. Chino, tuna.

It's all about tuna. We got a tuna for a row. Tuna melt. Tuna melt. Tuna melt.

Tuna melt. Tuna melt. Tuna melt. I've had a complete brain wipe. I've got no idea what we were talking about.

I was just coming around to bringing us up to date, and you were starting by that stage to play some newish numbers, including Never Give Up, starts up here, which brings us on to, the new new songs. So I thought, if possible, you might give me a little bit of a treat for half an hour and strung one or two. Just, in my day job, we would say, to act as a placeholder. Lorem Ipsum, that thing makes me so angry. Yeah.

To, I do not well, yeah. I did not. I mean, I do enjoy violence against language, but it's got to be creative and funny the way that the soul singers do it. What I cannot stand is just gratuitous ignorance, and lorem ipsum makes my blood boil. So I will try and do versions that are a little bit better than that.

So I've written down, I think, three or four that I'm aware of. But you, last time, I think you might have mentioned you you rattled off a dozen or so names that are in your mind or that you're brewing up. Yes. We need the instructions for this. So So I've written down Amalfi Coast, May 1963, and Melanie Hargreeves.

Okay. Well, those will both be available, do you Yeah. On YouTube. And the highest in the land, And never give up. Yep.

In fact, all of these all of these gems can be found from the YouTube. So you're going back out of that. Yes. So those four, I'm aware, are in particular because they're out there. Yeah.

But you might want to just I don't. Have them briefly. Do you want me to sing them, or do you want me to talk about them? Remind me of a night be toast. I must have heard it because you played it with quartet, but I I don't remember it, and I can't find it anywhere.

There is a recording of one of the Playhouse gigs, the entire concert. I think it's the second Playhouse gig. So it must have been Stevie Spinach on the gig with us, I think. And, that has it right at the front end. Yeah.

It's it's like an imaginary film soundtrack to a film set in Italy in 1963. Alice, are you familiar with very early soft machine? Sorry. Excuse my April. Or the first solo piece of Kevin Ayers, like Joy of the Toy or something like that.

Okay. It's that summery Mediterranean, slightly prog vibe. And I think there's a bit of Nino Rotor in my mind as well when it comes to the melodies that will sit on top of this. But it has absurd rhythmic complexity. It switches from bars of five to bars of six, almost apparently at random.

And when I took it to the quartet, I was a little bit nervous about how long it might take to teach the rhythm section how to do it. First time we played it, Stevie Gruffalo, all the way through. Not a hair out of place. Oh, Wait. Just washing the sound engineer's ears to see whether he's screwed or not.

Yes. You're sort of getting it, I think. +1, 23. That's still not good, is it? +1, 23.

+1, 23. +1 22. +1 23. I had it on completely the wrong setting on the capo, and it's only when I had to go up for the, d minor seventh. I realized quite how far up the dusty end I'd gone.

2, g. One, two, g. And that's that. Yes. That sounds, sounds like the sun's out.

Yeah. And, and, you know, maybe Audrey Hepburn is there in green sunglasses. Oh, open topped car on the road. You know that road that goes down the Amalfi Coast, like, above the village? Yeah.

Sun's out five in the morning. Open top white sports car. Audrey quite possibly in this passenger seat here. I wouldn't let her drive if she's had too much whiskey. Yeah.

And that will have, like, cheesy Italian plastic organs all over it playing the melody lines. Simon did a nice job, boo. It's a little bit too fluid, and I might try and get him to put some flugelhorn on there just to sort of, again, soundtrack it up, you know. But, the way I yeah. I'd I'd definitely see, like, Farfisa type organs playing melodies.

So that's that one. And Melanie Harvey's, I I've heard a few times. Yeah. What's the story behind that? It comes from Duran, my lodger.

He'd only been here a few days, and I forget who was here. There was someone who's visiting. And, when it became clear that Duran came from sort of Merseyside way, albeit the posh end, the fellow said, So when did you last see a burned out motor? You know, making conversation with the natives. You know?

And Duran quite earnestly answered, oh, well, that would be Melanie Hargreeves' father's jaguar. And, we were talking about this. Melanie Hargreeves, it turned out, was the first girl that Duran ever kissed. And her father had this jaguar, which little bollocks stole and took down to the beach and torched. And so the story told itself, really.

Initially, I was hearing TV personality's song, Salvador Dali's Garden Party. Salvador Dali's Garden Party, everybody was there. Julie Christie was there, and so on. And I heard Melanie Hargreaves' father's Jaguar. But I was working at the time with the quartet, and I was thinking, you know, it's about time I wrote something for these dudes that's in in their kind of style.

And that's I just fell on the, the sort of e minor b seventh sort of basic bluesy thing. You know, I went down to Saint James infirmary, that sort of thing. And, just the thing wrote itself. The chords fell out. Even the chorus chords just fell out.

And the thing, it was one of those songs like La Mer that wrote itself in about seven minutes. And I'm always keen to hang on to tunes like that because I always feel that when they write themselves quite that easily, there's probably something good about them. And the highest in the land Yeah. Seen it. I don't I I must have heard it out live.

But, Again, you can see a rather scabby video of me doing that in Brighton last year. Yeah. Or the I think that's what I have seen. Yeah. Yeah.

It's about othering. Othering? Other it's about the other and the way that we react to it or the way that people react to it because I don't identify myself. Yeah. Largely to do with animals.

There's a verse that he wrote, number one chief assistant, and it was hilarious because when I played in Glasgow, obviously not one person in that audience had ever heard this song before. And I'm tooling away through it, and there's an instrumental. And after the instrumental, I have, once or twice in rehearsal, been putting in this extra verse for Yaman here, for Raoul. And I'm literally thinking on my feet, except I'm not on my feet, I'm sitting down, but there's there's a story. Yeah.

I'm I'm thinking on my feet as it were, and I'm thinking shall I do the Raoul verse? And as I hit the end of the instrumental, I'm thinking, why the hell not? So I go, hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Hey. Now bear in mind, none of these punters have ever heard this song before. I clocked them on the very first line. There's two blokes down the front, and I sing the first line. Hey.

Hey. Boop a roop. Boop a roop. And I sing flocking pin. Hey.

Hey. Boop a roop. And they're singing along. A word that doesn't exist on a song they've never heard before, and the sec the first opportunity they get to sing it, they're singing it. I thought, that's nice.

So, yeah, it's about it's about the relationship of humans and animals and humans and other humans that they don't get on with, including the verse about Northampton Town. And it goes still still buzzing. I can't stand this being out of tune. It's odd, actually. This guitar is usually pretty good at staying in, but it's sounding like shit today.

Come on. Uh-huh. I got this fish from Genghis Khan. I got this fish from Genghis Khan. Gonna read my Bible.

I'm gonna study my Quran. Now I've been a monk since I was eight years old. Yeah. I've been a monk since I was eight years old. I don't want your money, baby.

I don't want your gold. Because I can see you and I don't need you and I'm not going to if I don't want to. Just because you had tell me to. Who the fuck can have I get anyway? Take a twat.

Take a twat. Now I live in a town wanna take a good life, I recommend that you don't go because I'm not going to if I don't want to. Just because you tell me to. You're going to have to understand. You're messing with the highest in the land.

Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

Sing like a theremin, walk like a man. And all along Yeah. Not the best way I've ever played it. That's, that's reminded me for some reason of that, cover Gold you play sometime. Why would it?

I have no idea. It's not even in the Thames. It's not in the same key. It's not in the same time signature. Gold is largely major.

This is largely minor. Gold is folk based. This is blues based. The only thing I can think that they really have in common is one, I'm fingerpicking, and two, that the capo is on the second fret. Maybe it's just me.

I mean, gold is, Gold would be precious if it didn't require such hardy to see it to find it mines. Things remain precious just as long as they're red. So if gold could be found lying around everywhere, there it would be the lowest metal. It's too soft for serious use. So I can see it's totally unrelated.

Or maybe it's the feeling it leaves. I don't know. I don't know what it was, but I think it just came to mind. Yeah. I I want I wanted to, also sort of briefly cover Never Give Up.

Alright. Because, there's something there's a sparkle in the guitar, at a certain point in the chorus that I wanted to to just explore. Usually takes me a minute or two to get on a bike with this one. Depends how complicated I try to be. Because you don't know me.

That is c, b flat, a. That's what that is. It's just I mean, you you you've got your c shape up here, and it's yeah. Just Just a little figure on the top. Absolutely.

It's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, nice little shimmer on the analog delay that I use as well. But that's that's all it is.

It's in a way, it's really quite overwrought just to pull it out there, but it does and it sits nicely against the lyric. You know? You don't know me. It's almost like a call and response thing. Yeah.

Yeah. Do you wanna delve into what that's about? It seems quite personal. What shall we say? It's quite old.

It was only when I might have said this before. It was only when I hit on the little top and tail never give up routine Yes. You said that. That I considered rescuing the song. I thought that it was it sort of belongs of a piece with things like Mercy and, Shaky.

It comes from that sort of period around sort of 2010 sort of period. Yeah. I think I did first play it out in 02/2010. I remember playing it at the Constitution, but then I shelved it. I just did it the one so I think Max was there, actually.

I think he clocked it, But then I shelved it and then it came back a little bit when we were playing on that 2015 tour in France with the quartet. Because we were playing weird venues, we didn't really understand the concept of a rock show. We were doing all kinds of weird long sets. There was one particular night we did three forty five minute sets. And, on nights like that, it might suddenly appear.

And Simon was always a big defender of it. Simon Simon used to like the song and say, oh, should now actually do ballad that. But I still didn't really think anything of it until one day. I was just fooling around, and it was Never give up. Never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. I wasn't ready for you. And it just seemed to set everything in place. And then the real moment where I knew I was winning was when I went, never give up.

Never give up. Never give up. Never give up until you want to. And that still puts the sugar down me now. I actually practice the end of that.

I actually practice going until you want to and those notes have been selected and chosen. I've studied loads of different view. Little details that sound like they're just shrugged off your shoulder, you know. There's so much work can go into it. And that just that the phrasing until you want to and then I actually practice standing still and staring at them before leaving.

It's all it's it's perhaps unusually considered. I don't usually think about how things are to be presented live beyond practical musical terms. But that song demands that you leave a little space after it and just yeah? You know? And it talks the lyrics talk of, like, disintegration, you know, screaming on the stairs or the surroundings or something.

But Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I suppose that the the process is, you know, you you your first verse is just plainly romantic. You know? Oh, how could anyone ever be ready for you and all that?

In the second verse, we get a little bit sort of philosophical about it. It's like, oh, I agree with Dave, which is Dave Jay, of course, Embrace Your Dysfunction, which is on etiquette of violence. Hey. Hey. Good evening.

We were hearing earlier about Melanie Hargreaves. Oh, yeah? Yeah. She's Yeah. How much?

Great mystery. I've no idea. I've no idea. I've been quite tempted to look her up, but then it's I'll look her up. That'd be even creepier.

But, yeah, it's it's on the first couple of verses, it kind of steams through. And then towards the end of the second verse, it all starts to go a little bit sour. You know? Like, oh, what if it all goes wrong? And then you hit the the middle eight very, very fucking arch.

I'm surprised no one slapped me for doing this, but, you know, I'm married Isis on the first day of me. Straight out of the Bob Dylan song. But also the correct date. And I don't know what to tell you about Isis. I for for a couple of years, I didn't know if I should sing this song in case people thought I was singing about fucking Al Qaeda.

You know? But I kinda got over that. I thought, well, I should have been around for a whole lot longer than they have. So, yeah, there, it's it's like, you know, you can see him sort of smashing up his life in real time. And then that last that that that last verse, you know, it's like again, it starts off all romantic, and then it just flips over.

And it's like, yeah. This is what it's really like. You don't know me. So that's where the where the stings are. For me, anyway.

There's a film solicited to the Kettering Ford, Isis Legal. Alright. I was talking to to Lindsay the other day about PIMS and the damage that PIMS can do, and I was explaining that it's related to Eights Week in Oxford where they all have their little rowing boat races. And they hand out free PIMS down by the river, and you just see the finest minds of your generation, bathing and puking and fighting and crying and shagging in the woods. Why did why did Tims come up?

What did you just say? Isis legal. No. That's right. Yeah.

You see, the reach of the Tims that they have there in Oxford, they call it the Isis. And I was chatting with Linds, and I suddenly thought, well, I wonder if they still call it that. And then I thought, yeah. Of course, they fucking do. So I've themselves in that city that they probably hadn't noticed that there was a fucking operation going around with that title.

You know? So there's no those four we're aware of? Melanie Hargreaves, Amalfi Coast. Highest and Highest and Never Grew Up. That's right.

You've got those. Now I think beyond that, we're going to struggle, especially in terms of conversation because I think we're dealing with musical and lyrical fragments that I can't actually present you with the whole thing. Let's have a look here. Melfi, Melanie Hardridge, Never Give Up Highest, Goodnight, Sweetheart. Guess how that goes?

Goodnight, Sweetheart is an ending in search of a song. And I have got a song, Though I haven't got all the lyric for the song. I think we're here. In Temple of tea, Patrick. There's no one I'd rather be here with you.

Paul and Jim. I never saw. This is it's got a recital of the intro, so only a root note really, isn't it? I mean, it's all very friendly. It's like some dolphins or something.

One more. So you have a couple of verses like that, and then it's gonna go quiet. And it will go like. You know I said, how does it go? Oh, well.

And that will just barrel and barrel and barrel. And it freaks me out a little bit because I've kinda decided that will be the last thing that I record. So Not necessarily the last thing in the session. That would be taking things to extremes, which I've got a feeling the record's gonna close with that. And it'll be one of those, you know, diamorphine angels, sister death type jobs, art mystery job.

And, yeah, it's about thinking your girlfriend might be dead. Yes. When your phone's not working. But she's not. And it is.

And it is. And all you need to do is to swish it off and then I'll again. Apparently so. So, yeah, that's got some darkness. Damn this.

Fucking. Time is just a kind of fake can number. It really it it depends upon a beat, so I can't really do much with that. Couple of vaguely amusing things here. This one's based on the fact that all Dave j songs go c and f.

No. Actually, this one's going Oh, no. It's going. Oh, no. We could make it go c and f, but we won't.

We'll make it go b flat and, e flat instead. Wait a minute. Teddy had to come to a little accommodation. Things hadn't turned out in the way he'd hoped they'd hoped. Teddy got off three stops beyond his station, still believing he'd get paid if he was good.

Work in progress. Who's Teddy? Teddy's a cipher. It's about musicians. It's about what it's like being a musician.

You know? Still believing he'd get paid if he if he was good. It's one of the big mistakes you can make in this game. And then we oh, yeah. There's I'm an idiot.

That's a promising little thing. That's a sort of jaunty Pete Doherty sort of affair, really. What's the second chord, Pat? Because I'm an idiot. Hey.

Hey, baby. I'm an idiot. Don't go away because I'm an idiot. That kinda runs along like that. I haven't got all the words for that.

I've I've got them somewhere in a notebook, but I've lost them. Keep the whistling in if you can. Actually, it might it might be a song that could suit that. Yeah. Yeah.

That helps. Yeah. It might suit it. Oh, there's running on fumes. There's possibility of putting on versions of Quality People and the new version of Shame About You.

And there's You Can't Hurt Me, which is only a working title. It's a kind of soul number. Very Harold Melvin and the blue notes. Hey. Where are we?

And my favorite part of this is, when I go out in the evenings, I step out on my own. When I come home, just a word in your hand upon it. Feel so bad to be all alone. I can't stand it. And right now, I'm toying with the idea of going from.

Yeah. But I don't know if I can sing it. I'll do it. But that that actually exists as a as a whole song, as a piece of music, but I don't know what I'm doing with it lyrically, really. I've only got fragments.

Running on fumes reminds me of, my family forever accusing me of trying to kill them. And Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm actually sort of running out of fuel in running out of gas on the second time I ever drove in America. Alright.

And and I always say, you know, whenever I ever let you down, you know. Yeah. The answer is always never, but you've come close. Like that time that we traveled across the Mojave with a quarter of a tank of fuel. That one.

That time. Mhmm. Mhmm. And Yeah. That would do it for you.

We're running off fumes, running off fumes. Lord, everybody's running off fumes. There's nothing in the bank. There's nothing in the tank. Everybody's running off fumes.

Running off fumes. Running off fumes. Fumes. Richard Branson, Esther Branson, everybody's running off fumes. Make your own entertainment.

That's what you're gonna have to do. Make your own entertainment while you slowly come to understand your Yeah. Yeah. That's that's definitely the last line of that one. Definitely gotta stay in here.

Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, all these things, they're not in the right key. Things might change quite a lot. A lot of them have lyrics to be added.

Oh, the sea madness as well. And play the original version of this. C a. Yeah. Oh, that's put me off.

So he's wearing glasses. Let's try that again. Chorus goes my beautiful sea monster sea monster, elephant baby. And I tried to make that scene by making it, my beautiful sea mannings. My beautiful sea mannings.

And there's all kinds of things happening. Like, for example, you've got the minor there the first time around. Second time around, it's gonna be a major. Just it's it's an old trick going from minor to major on a chorus like that, swapping it over. It's a shame.

C cucumber doesn't scare. There is a professor in Japan who writes songs about C cucumbers. There really is. He loves sea cucumbers, and he loves them so much that when he's finished studying them for the day, he goes home and writes songs about how great they are. So, yeah.

I'd I'd I'd had a whole lyric for that, but I didn't like it. And so it won't be the one. But sea madness is still the working title. But I've got this bad feeling that at the end of the day, it's gonna go, my beautiful sea monster, elephant lady. You see what I mean?

I I think it's unavoidable because every time I run this beautiful sea monster elephant baby by someone, they just go, that's great. So I've got a bad feeling it's gonna somehow end up with that. But for the minute, we call it sea madness, And it's kind of a Kevin Ehrzy sort of thing. So there's all that. And then there's the one I come up just the other day.

I thought, why not, you know, respect the traditions of the blues and the traditions of rock. Why not, as a white man, start stealing melodies from old Trojan Rocksteady hits from the early sixties? And I thought this is a rich scene to be explored. And almost straight away, I'd had a chord sequence I didn't know what to do with. Almost straight away, it made some sense if I can remember it.

Come on. No. Maybe not. Maybe I'll just irritate you for a bit. Scratch a little.

That doesn't seem like a very good idea, does it? Unfortunately, I've got tape of this on a four track if I can't remember it. It. No. It's doubled.

So it starts 234. 12. Alright. I started off because it was it reminded me of the old rock steady tune I was thinking of. And at the minute, I'm searching around for something that scans like over the rainbow's end, and I've had a few thoughts, but I don't know which way it's going yet.

But it's such a pretty little thing, and it's so simple, and then it just drops into a Woah. Woah. No. It doesn't do that. And then so it just repeats on itself, and I think that's probably all it's gonna need, honestly.

Oh, god. And then there's yeah. I did a recording session for May the other night doing some guitar and bass on a couple of his songs, and I got home and I thought, you know what, Chris? Those chords are really good. I might nick them.

That's, I mean, all he was doing was, can't remember. Just one of those. You know? Just all the pop songs. But I have other takes on that.

I don't have to go For example, you know? No, I know how to go. And I've been toying around ever since Wednesday night with, trying to do that, but I think anything that I take away from that session in regards to those chords and shapes will probably end up as part of I'm an idiot. And at the end of the day, it'll be different time signature, different key, different chord sequence, But I know I've stolen it, and there you do too. Except, you know, it's it's like the Wilson sampling thing.

It's like you take a sample, but by the time you finish with it so much. Yeah. Exactly. By the time you finish with it, it sounds like something else. Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly that. And all songwriting. You know, there's only there's only sort of like 12 chords. Well, 24 chords, I suppose.

Well, it depends if you want diminished and the augmented. There's a lot of of chords. But at the end of the day, there's only 12 notes. You know? I was thinking since the last time we spoke, because as we finished about, oh, come all ye faithful for some reason.

Just in connection with the bells. And talking about, you know, why does God this, amazing thing that created the universe demand that we adore him. Yes. And I was thinking that, you know, we should at least abhor him. You know, abhor him would be a little too Well, I don't think that's very good.

Not very nice. Rejecting God, hating God. I mean, that's not really gonna get you anywhere, isn't it? Is it really? We can ignore him.

And I was thinking that there's this suggestion of the Chinese Japanese birds. Because you know how on how become fully faithfully, then the Yeah. That's when you need the bells in the church tower. You need to be and I imagine standing in the church tower, but I don't know how the notes go. But it needs tiny Japanese bells, standard little happy bells.

And then to paraphrase that scene of Jaws, we need some bigger bells. The shirts ringing Which song is this? Oh, come let us in. Yeah. But I know.

I'll come all I'll come all you faithful, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, I'm all you faithful, joyful and triumphant. But what's that gotta do with which of these songs has that got to do with? It's got nothing to do with anything.

It's just just what I wrote from last week. Alright. Sorry. I'm being sick. There's something I'm not getting here.

Yeah. It's there's no connection. I just wrote it down. And also no connection. It's this little I wrote I I did a little photo montage.

Alright. Having having having scanned all of those Right. I thought, what would happen if I took all of the bits of the photos that you're not paying any attention to because they're in the background? Sure. Or not to do with the people and put them in 16 blocks because the, so far we've done 16 sessions, which is quite neat because it runs it follows that four by four grid Mhmm.

Like the four by four grid of the pictures on the front of Sex and Travel and all that sort of thing. And just about any music you care to mention. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not recognizing everything.

No. You may. Oh, that's my wallpaper. Yeah. So It's just some kind of oh, that's Mitch making a video.

Mhmm. I don't there's one that looks like the front end of a drag race. I don't know what that is. Yeah. That's that's, Cole Cole and you drag racing.

There's a photo of me and Cole at the drag racing? Well, there's a photo of a drag car in there. Yeah. Yeah. Extraordinary.

That's me and Sonic at the NUJ benefit. Not quite sure what that is. Looks like a gig. The one with the sunflower at the bottom. What is that?

Penultimate. Oh, this one? There. Yeah. Oh, no.

That's a jukebox. No. That's a pinball machine. You playing pinball. Alright.

You know? Yeah. Anyway. It's little Drake arthropods. This is is this the Roxy?

That's the Roxy in LA. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh, Spencer. Yes. Is that the That's Spencer. Mhmm. Don't tease the gator man.

Lord. Yeah. We used to get you back to dance on the, on the stage, and then in in North Carolina, a voice came from the audience. Don't tease the gator, man. Lord.

Dear old Spencer. Yeah. It looks nice. And there we must have had. Yeah.

Giving me a bit of a treat at the end there. Sorry. I'm not really I haven't really got my I can play guitar.
