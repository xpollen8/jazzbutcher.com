				This is in no way a &quot;defence&quot; of any JBC product.  I
				don&apos;t feel that I need to defend the stuff.  There are
				bits and pieces that make me cringe now and again, but
				I&apos;m quite happy to say so.  For the most part I like
				my stuff, which is why I made it.  I don&apos;t understand
				musicians who don&apos;t listen to their stuff.  If they don&apos;t
				think it&apos;s worth playing, why did they spend all those
				thousands of bucks on making rubbish?  No.  Once JBC
				stuff is out there in the commercial arena then it belongs
				to the people who&apos;ve paid for it, and they are (as I
				understand it) free to think what they like of our efforts.
				So I&apos;m not after convincing anybody of anything, I&apos;m
				just coming on line with a few random observations.  As
				soon as I&apos;ve rolled This...

				The one nobody ever talks about, even though a surprising
				number of you seem to have it.  Recorded for just &#163;300
				(Kevin Shields please take note...), it&apos;s really just
				the sound of a few mates failing to take seriously the
				fact they they&apos;ve got an l.p. to make.  {gloop} and the
				unfinished {engine} make me squirm a fair bit, but {zombie},
				{gold} and {party} have all been good friends.  It seems
				VERY early eighties now, but you must remember that there
				was a LOT of crap for us to clear out of the way in those days.

				The Albatross.  Since the recording of {bacon} (almost
				two years before this one) we had become a &quot;proper&quot;
				group.  For all that, we still pooled our skills in
				the studio, and this isn&apos;t a bad two weeks&apos; work.  I
				think that, lyrically, a lot of the songs are a bit
				trite and immature, and our inability to take ourselves
				seriously is much in evidence.  A record, I feel, of
				its time.  We were young(ish) and cocky and I think
				it shows.  I still haven&apos;t learned to sing on this one,
				which bugs me too.  Still, it was cheap and cheerful,
				and it helped us to meet an awful lot of people.  I
				was told, incidentally, that if we released this on
				Glass we could expect a top global sale of 2,000.  We
				released it on Glass and sold about 25,000 copies.

				One day&apos;s rehearsal in {hask}&apos;s living room, five days&apos;
				recording and two days&apos; mixing was all it took for us
				to make my favourite of the Glass records.  Now that
				the band had done a few dates with decent p.a. systems
				and stuff, I was beginning to have some sort of a bead
				on this singing business.  Also, having exhausted the
				initial stick of JB songs (several of the {scandal} tunes
				had actually been written at the time of {bacon}, but
				were rejected back then as needing further development),
				I was obliged for the first time to write about my life
				as it was at the time, which was very different to the
				way I lived when writing the first two records.  Now
				I was &quot;in a band&quot;, had left my day job, had been to
				Europe... I even started to write songs that were not
				self-consciously deferential and mocking.  Hence, I
				guess, the arrival of the first recorded &quot;big ballad&quot;
				in {rumour}, where {dj}&apos;s harmonies at the end STILL give
				me the shivers.  I think that now we had started to
				learn about actually creating recordings rather than
				just recording the sound of a bunch of pals fooling
				around, and the disc does have a nice, unified feel.
				Credit {rivers} for his high-speed mixing job.  When
				I think about it, this l.p. doesn&apos;t really have any
				&quot;great&quot; tunes, in the sense of numbers that people request
				or whatever, but it has a nice totality, a good, atmospheric
				vibe.  This one I&apos;d actually defend at length if I had to.

				A Sri Lankan gentleman once sat down beside me in a
				bar in Bremen, asked me to sign his copy of this record,
				and then, even as I wrote messages of good luck and global
				harmony, announced sternly &quot;This is a very...bad record.&quot;
				He was a berk, but he had a point.  Alan McGee and a
				number of people in France, America and The Music Business
				have called this one a &quot;classic album&quot;.  People do,
				of course, say much the same about <b>Dark Side Of The
				Moon</b>.  Can you hear my flesh creeping?  Germans,
				on the other hand, despise it almost universally.
				We were deeply confused young men when we made this
				record.  {max}, {owen} and I had all been drinking dangerously
				for over a year now, and the poor bass player who replaced
				{dj} was finding it almost impossible to keep up with
				our twisted thought patterns.  Do you like my bass playing?
				That&apos;s me on {shame}, {sa} and a couple of others.  By
				now, effectively, Max and I had totally lost any sense
				of quality control on my writing.  Tragic and sincere
				or glib and ludicrous, we recorded EVERYTHING.  Sent
				in to make demos for this l.p.  Max and I came out with
				{conspir}, where we squandered a couple of great ideas
				that this l.p. so badly needs.  {rivers}, you&apos;ll notice,
				has bought a new reverb unit, a Lexicon, in fact.  He&apos;s
				also taken to recording digitally.  The ensuing absurd
				gloss, matched with an absence of native intelligence
				around the bottom end, gives a lot of the songs a sound
				that I dislike.  ON THE OTHER HAND, there&apos;s {angels},
				there&apos;s {fall}, there&apos;s {world}.  Still, in 1986 the best
				plan would be to but the <Link href="/releases/angels.html"><b>12&quot;
				single</b></Link> and go see the band in concert.
				Generally, we had it down in concert.  In just about
				every other department, however, we were coming to bits,
				individually and collectively, and to me this record
				actually shows the morbid state of things at the time.
				Not, of course, that we really noticed any of this until
				months later, when, confronted by the realitied of having
				been on an accidental two-year intercontinental binge,
				we retired damaged, leaving the group in pieces.  Oh,
				and another thing about <b>&quot;Gentlefolk&quot;</b>...  it&apos;s
				pretentious too.

				Having ended up on {creat}, which I took as a bit of
				a validation, I was keen to get as far away from all
				those &quot;w&quot; words that had followed my group around, and
				to make it as clear as I could that this was a rock
				& roll thing, not some &quot;eccentricity&quot;.  I had my shades
				and I had my fringed suede jacket and I had the {weather}
				rhythm section.  In the last flickering days before
				Marriage and Acid House would change the world {kizzy}
				and I hung out in his dealer&apos;s flat in Islington and
				WALKED to the studio in Waterloo everyday.  The sessions
				were chaotic and funny.  At one stage Kizzy arrived
				56 hours late for a mix, having been held by the Police
				under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
				{del} has
				this down right as a sort of self-justificatory thing.
				What disappoints me is that it came out sounding so
				SMOOTH and tidy.  I&apos;d hoped it would be more harsh and
				mad.  I guess perhaps it&apos;s the saxes, which, I recall,
				enraged some reviewers.  {sonic} does good things on
				{sue} (that&apos;s 4 of them big ballads at least, now), that
				was more the idea.  Still, not to slag {iain} who began
				a lengthy association with the JBC on this recording.
				This sold rather well, which was pleasing, and seems
				widely liked.  I can&apos;t fuck with that, but I had hoped
				that it would be more a &quot;change of direction&quot; than it
				was.  But I like <b>Fishcotheque</b>; I wish there more
				records as good as it.

				This record gives me the pip.  I think that the blame
				can be laid at my door and on the neatly-polished doorstep
				of {rivers}.  This was a real &quot;band&quot; album by a touring
				unit which had become really quite ferocious.  In choosing
				to work with John again we felt that we were sufficiently
				noisy and fierce to cope with any over-tidy production
				strokes he might pull.  &quot;Clean *that* up, then, ya bastard&quot;
				was out declared policy in the group.  Of course, we
				under-rated him.  My share of the blame lies, I feel,
				in the rather hectoring tone of the lyrics.  Early 1989
				was, indeed a strange and desperate time; London, our
				base, really was beginning to seize up and malfunction
				after all that triumphalist Tory looting that had been
				going on.  We listened to a lot of hip-hop and soul
				music at the time, and I think that we considered ourselves
				sufficiently HARD to take the whole fucker on in an
				l.p.  Well, that was our idea - a surrealist broadside
				on EVERYTHING.  The &quot;We&apos;re-mad-as-hell-and-we&apos;re-not-going-
				to-take-it-any-more&quot; album.  Also, I wanted to start
				to mess with the pretty traditional song structures
				we were using.  We were all aware that music was changing,
				and, more out of interest than out of any spurious &quot;career&quot;
				concern, we wanted to see where we could take our pop
				songs using things like breakdowns, the mixing in of
				&quot;found&quot; voices (which we first heard NOT from Steinski
				or the Bryne/{eno} collaboration, but from John Stapleton,
				a DJ who scratched things in at early {aero} concerts),
				radical and unexpected changes of sounds - a series
				of sonic events rather than plain old verse/chorus structure.
				I probably did too much pre-production on my (new) 4-track
				at home, and the whole thing sounds a bit stillborn.
				Possibly with a more &quot;clued-in&quot; producer and a bit more
				self-discipline we could have come up with something
				like what we were looking for.  Instead, with the exception
				of {good} (another one - Hi, Stuart) and maybe {lineo},
				it all comes out sounding kinda...&quot;wrong&quot;.  A curious
				record.  If you actually put it on and play it then
				it&apos;s pretty smart; it&apos;s just that I never really seem
				to WANT to put it on.  A record out of time and place.
				A bit of a missed opportunity, I guess.

				Well, if things seemed weird back in February 1989,
				by January 1990, when we made this baby, the Weird were
				going shopping on bikes.  With {kizzy} sick and unable
				to tour, {richard} had joined and, during a long US/Canadian
				tour has turned us all on to Can
				and a lot of other weird things.  In a farmhouse in
				the dead of winter, in personal circumstances too bizarre
				and complex to relate, we set about making our &quot;commercial
				suicide&quot; album.  When we delivered it to {creat} they
				did their nuts and said it was the best thing we&apos;d done
				in years.  It took me a while to figure it out, but
				then I agreed with them.  For the first time, I felt,
				we had made an album that really sounded like us.  In
				retrospect, one or two of the tunes are a touch throwaway,
				and EVERYBODY hates poor ol&apos; {bait}, but you get {go},
				{drugs} AND {sis} AND {odd} all on one record! Goodness!
				This record does have personality.  It also has {lix}
				on guitar, the start of another beautiful friendship.
				One of my favourites, this.

				Four desperate men, all too desperate to notice how
				desperate the others are, gather in a farmhouse with
				a queue of lead guitarists stretching round the block.
				For all the pain and crap from which this record was
				made, the actual sessions were a gigantic and wonderful
				party.  The songs are all long because we ({paul}, {joea},
				{lix} & I) just enjoyed the playing on the &quot;to-be-faded&quot;
				bits so much that it seemed a shame not to let everyone
				hear them.  This was warmly received by The Outside
				World, less popular among those who counted themselves
				JBC afficionados.  Well, I couldn&apos;t have written it
				any other way, and I love that everyone plays on it,
				so I&apos;m not in much of a position to know why you don&apos;t
				care for it.  All I can say is that I&apos;m still well pleased
				with it as a recording, and as a piece of writing about
				a tough subject.  I mean, *I* hate &quot;divorce rock&quot; too.
				It wuz a tough assignment.  Go on, give the fucker another
				listen.  The songs may not make you laugh, but the playing
				ought to give you a few thrills.  And, after all, I&apos;m
				not in a band to make money, or be a &quot;professional entertainer&quot;
				- I&apos;m in a band because I like to play very loud electric
				guitar.  This IS the sound of me having fun, and getting
				me to do that in those dark days of mid-1991 was no
				small job.  (Can anyone tell me how I *knew* that the
				French were going to like {girls}?)

				Too early for me to say, but there&apos;s a clean, simple
				sound to a lot of this that {blue} detractors might
				appreciate.  It&apos;s not a deliberate change of musical
				policy, just a gradual personal evolution thing.  I&apos;m
				ten years older now than when I made {bacon}, and right
				now, after all that morbid stuff, it only really feels
				like about three.  There&apos;s rockin&apos; shit and there&apos;s
				a big ballad or two and some weird little pop songs
				and a nice family sing-along about penguins.  I hope
				you like it.
