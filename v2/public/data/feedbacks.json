I was visiting my girlfriend, Alexia Sabor, in Chicago ... it was 1986, and I saw a flier glued to a telephone pole.\r\n  \"The Jazz Butcher,\" I laughed at the name.  I new nothing about them... nothing.\r\n  A few weeks later, I had driven to Chi-town again to see Alexia.  We had nothing to do, and she said that band I kept mentioning was playing that very night.\r\n  It was at the Metro.  We watched from the balcony ... and I was hooked.  Shortly after I bought my first LP, Scandel in  Bohemia... many more followed.\r\n  By '88 I had moved to Chicago, but there was no more Alexia... she had dumped me and married the guy she left me for.  But, on the positive side, I caught JBC at the Cubby Bear!  Another spur of the moment event.  My roommate and I were shopping for BIG BLACK records when we saw a sign that TJBC was playing down the street... the show had started.  We ran as fast as we could, and didn't miss a JB song!  God must have wanted me to be a Jazz Butcher fan... because the coincidences are too hard to phantom!\r\n  Because I drank too much and took too many drugs... and failed to get a suitable job... I managed to get kicked out of 2 apartments, I  quit school and move back to Peoria.  \r\n  But all was not lost.  I turned my friend Torry on to TJBC and we spent the next 5 years drinking, getting drunk, watching his gold fish, toasting, listening to and singing Jazz Butcher tunes.\r\n  \"I don't wait 'til I'm sober, 'til I get drunk again,\"   \"I just want to drink 'til I can't see...\" etc...  \"I've got a mind like a playground...\"  \r\n  Oh, these were the anthems of a 20 year old boy!\r\n  We relished in the rights of passage the Jazz Butcher initiated us through.\r\n  I'm pushing 35 now, but I still dig out those old vinyl (glasss)LP's and think about all those wonderful memories...  too many to tell you about.\r\n  But I will tell, they sure do make me smile.\r\n\r\n  God Bless, the Jazz Butcher!","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":3116,"parent_id":null,"session_id":232166,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/angels.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"ANGELS","dtcreated":"2000-11-21T22:37:02.000Z","host":"","who":"gmcb@angelfire.com","whence":"YourTown, USofA","comments":"I said goodbye to a great friend last Saturday.\r\nJon Howard (some may have known him as Doug Mallard) Music was a large part of his life, especially the JBC, it got him through some rough times.

It was nice to see The Conspiracy out and about again.  It was great being able to say hi to Pat before the show as well, although I never say as much as I&#39;d like for fear of bugging him.\r\n\r\nDavid J was the special &#34;surprise&#34; guest.  He did a wonderful set that was a mixture of a couple Love and Rockets songs (a particularly amazing acoustic &#34;The Dog-End of a Day Gone By&#34; which has always been a favorite L+R song of mine&#41; some classics off his many great solo recordings including a slight reworking of the wonderful &#34;Crocodile Tears and the Velvet Cosh&#34; (very nice David!&#41; and some very good new material off a forthcoming release. Anyway, anyone wanting to see him, he&#39;s playing at the Troubadour again July 31st I believe.  I am thinking about attending to see what else he has to offer.  plus, I&#39;ve always been a fan.  Can you tell?\r\n\r\nThe Butcher was great as always.  The show felt more like hanging out with friends while some particularly talented musicians were having some fun on stage.  JBC fans for the most part are such a friendly bunch too.  It&#39;s part of the fun of going to the shows really.  Well, everyone except these two women that thought my voice was too high to be polite.  Whatever that had to do with anything.  Anyway, Pat knows so many people here in LA that you feel like you are at a private show, but one that you were invited to as well.  In any case, the JBC has always had a great rapport with the audience and it&#39;s fantastic to get to experience it all again.\r\n\r\nHighlights of the show for me were &#34;Come Friendly Spacemen&#34; (a Sumosonic song&#41; which featured one Kevin Haskins wearing a space helmet and armed with a blaster shooting everyone in sight and a brilliant version of &#34;Sister Death&#34;, which is one of my many favorite JBC songs.\r\n\r\nThe band was great too.  Mr. Max Eider was in typically stunning form.  Pat let the cat out of the bag that Max is recording a new album for us as well! \r\n\r\nAlso, The Butcher evidently played an acoustic show on July 3rd.  Why wasn&#39;t that publicized?  I sure wish I could have been there.  I know of a bunch of people that would die for that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I sure hope the JBC comes back to LA soon. \r\n\r\n          Dave","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":3212,"parent_id":null,"session_id":62676,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"htdb/index.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Pat&#39;s July 3rd &#34;gig&#34;","dtcreated":"2001-07-10T22:20:20.000Z","host":"207.217.154.215","who":"cheeso65@yahoo.com","whence":"Cheeso, Los Angeles","comments":"Pat didnt do an acoustic show on July 3rd, he did a Dj set at the Knitting Factory.

Dec. 15, 1989 is a day that shall go down in our personal infamies - but in a good way of course. As always, the JBC&#39;s musical performance was top-notch as he jumped from Sex and Travel tunes to Fishcoteque tunes -which was bouncing around the college charts at the time- to the earliest performances (to me anyway&#41; of She&#39;s on Drugs and Mr. Odd. However, the highlight of the night was actually meeting the Butcher himself. Whilst a nameless opening band from my hometown did their best to entertain, our trio spotted a tall, darkly clad fellow, a fairly approachable man enjoying a Beck&#39;s near the middle of the dancefloor. Being the huge fans we are, our first thought was - &#34;Is that him?&#34; We decided that it was, yes, Pat Fish, in the flesh. Mustering up the courage, we approached our musical messiah and were instantly taken aback by his height - none of being overly altitudinous ourselves. Awkward introductions ensued and to everyone&#39;s surprise, young Jeff met the Butcher with a hug. Pat was a good and kind spirit and engaged us conversation for nearly 30-minutes. In the meantime we also had the opportunity to meet the new bass player, Lawrence O&#39;Keefe. He was less forboding as he was closer to our height, but that doesn&#39;t make him less of a man. We in that type of annoying hero-worship manner explained to the duo how we had eagerly awaited their arrival - since purchasing copies of Scandal in Bohemia. More thoughtful banter ensued, then it off to the show. Pat then astounded us by dedicating Love Kittens to &#34;Bruce and his cats&#34; during his first encore.

We had a rather apathetic student population in my time there and couldn&#39;t give away tickets for most of the bands we had. I must have played the Fishcoteque album about ten times over the college PA system in the week before the gig, to no avail, shouting at people to buy tickets as they set one foot on the steps down to the Student Union subterranean flea pit. I met Pat Fish and thought he was very down to earth, friendly and polite. I also helped set up the stage for the band and organise their food. About 100 people came to the gig which was a shame as they were excellent.

the sounds in vancouver canada at the commodore ballroom.it was the cult of the basement tour. i hadnt heard of them before, and a friend insisted we go see them that night.well i agreed ,then we dropped acid.it was very fun and i met people there that i had forgotten about,but should have known that they would be at a show of this nature.so that was cool cause i diddnt know that people were so into this style of music,so refreshing to here a sort of accomplished ,rock and rolly english chops that paid homage to classic feels as well as refining some original ideas without being boring or too serious.i dont remember too many other scenes that night,but the next day i had a new favourite band.i told all my friends these guys are neat and that they deserve a little stardom and money from all this ,if in fact they even care.like shes on drugs ,i thought that was a good radio pop tune.anyway who cares about that .i also saw the condition blue show ,also at the commodore.totally different ,different crowd.too many college types that wanted to here shes on drugs and talked during the slow stuff.nuff said ,i could tell it was not pats most enjoyable outing.in fact my ggirlfriend  and i left,embarrassed of where i come from,too many wannabes and this halfassed smugness that has no real merit.life in a conservative canadian city.yhe kind of place artists walk off stage in disgust.oh well. the i saw the jbc back in effect in seattle.the crocodile or something ,i think peter bucks got something to to with the venue wow so that was just as entertaining as the first jbc experience,only more mature,just as cocky and unintentionally witty with a sobering reminder of a veteran ice hockey player.he has scored some goals been a solid up and down winger ,now really doesnt have anything to prove and was playing for the love of the game and the respect he has for it.still the last man off the ice.like marcel dionne one of the best and least talked about.never won the stanley cup ,but it doesnt matter when you see him with that old purple and gold jersey flying down the ice full steam ahead ,the kind of guy who wouldnt take offers from other teams cause he was loyal to his line mates a leader in the dressing room,captain of the team even if some of his teamates might actually be equally talented they admired his honesty and sort of honour amoung theives integrity.they dont make em like marcel dionne anymore and they dont make em like pat and max and all the other members of the jbc alumni.by the way i met pat and max back stage after the show ,sorry if my friends and i were being goofy we were just young and didnt bring any pot with us cause one of my friend is a mormon and closet drug abuser ,and he brought his super sraight american wife to the show ,but it was ok i got drunk on cheap watery beer and we managed to bum a couple of pulls off of some sweet jane off mr. fish thanks man it was a nice way to end the evening and prepare for the ride home ,where i would be certain to endure stories of how we should try and book the jbc for a private gig in vancouver ,i just said it would be cool if i ever got married ,that i would ask them to play my wedding.but i doulbt that would get them out of bed on a sunday morning.even if i had the right beer and necessary party favors that would be expected at such an affair.by the way i have really enjoyed the latest songs maximillian eider has written recently, some good honest emotion ,content and slick manouvers on the sixed stringed super invention.a nice mix .pat and max seem to share an understanding,like highschool pals who sat at the back of the class laughing and nobody knew why. good to hear some of the old stuff again, i just pulled out distressed gentle folk ,got it for a dollar cause i fucked up my last copy.still love waiting for the love bus and of course bloody nonsense.actually i almost got to play music with one of the many conspirators a one dooj a bass player. my friend went to the u.k. years ago and met dooj in a pub next thing you know i get a letter from my buddy sayin hes playin david bowie and velvet underground covers in some local dive,and tells me to come over there.well i love the thin white duke and lou and everything but i was held back by thi girl who i spent all my money on.see i was sort of retired at a young age,like in my 20s.the she came aloung .up until then i was in a basement suite with some highschool mates playing keyboards in betwween women alot of coffee ,trying to score another lid of reefer.and i was snowboarding everyday but i dont live in idaho and i dont wear surfgear.i havent bought new clothes for a long time and it shows.i dont really like buying used clothes but what else is there? a fubu hoody? maybe some tan cargo pants? a pair of glow in the dark skechers that comes with a keychain that i cant wait to hang from my rear view mirror right next to my hello kitty airfreshner in my acura integra gs with a loud muffler that sounds like a beehive on crystal? with my special momo steering wheel talkin about ground effects and danny choos amg mercededes? no not me im just a half japanese half irish lad who is tryin to keep his dick hard in a cruel cold world .i need a new chic ,this sucks 8 yrs with that crazy ,sexy naive feisty german girl.but were still friends... my father once told me to marry this hot swiss girl i went around with for about 5yrs or so.he wwas a wise man she had the best body i ever encountered,but she was kinda boring,yet still down for the party.shes a physiotherapist living in tahoe.she was the best female i ever skied with.this is when skiing was not thought of as a 70s bond movie .she had really good form and would pop 360s off of the slightest mogul etc.quite sexy .my father also told me not to ever marry a german girl.i always wondered why until i found out my step mom was german.they eventually divorced after16yrs.it was his 2nd marriage.my real mom and him got divorced when i was three cause he got caught shaggin this other bird.evelyn i dont think i spelled her name right but she was cool.i like that name for a girl.my dad has a new wife and new kids ,they all live in seattle he looks good for his age.i still wouldnt ever want to throw hands with old pops.he is still tough ,like early 60s tough,the kind of japanese kid who has a white girlfriend ,creepers a dad who started the martial arts center in my home town and leaves a legacy that my uncles still talk about when we get together for an evening of mary jane ,beer in brown bottles and the worst acoustic guitar i can imagine.classic.the kind of guy who writes in his highschool annual under probable destiny,to buy a green kawasaki and join the hells angels.i dont even want to know if he ever realized his aspiration ,but i remember being on a green 350cc kawasaki going to kung -fu movies in chinatown and sparring with him in the back yard with full headgear.about this time he was delving into the inner morays of wu-shu style kung -fu.too flashy.anyway now im a lover not a fighter though i still enjoy the sweet science when displayed by consenting professionals ever since sugar ray leonard and roberto duran.t.v. rolemodels for an only child with no father ,growing up in the 70s slleeping in the cave supper club where my mom was the head waitress for years,good times,met alot of characters.thats where i started to listen to music and was exposed to all sorts of entertainment one minute ray charles next some foul mouthed loverboy ripoff.my mom dated this drummer from hawaii named masa he was genuine and he had mangos in his yard in maui.he played in this band called s.o.s. society of seven akind of  more cutting edge response to the don ho phenomema that never really captured my heart.but s.o.s did ,they were fun and they played original stuff as well a popular covers ,even tiny bubbles! they also juggled fire and stuff before every street performer in venice beach even knew which end to light.yeah those were good times,crazy parties i should never been exposed to.big ugly mansions with moldy pools ,with no lady of the house around,hot tubs with cheryl ladd lookalikes with blondie or rod stewart playing through homemade speakers while i watched unaffected while they partook in peruvian flake cocaine.better than the baby sitters,until later when this 13yr old fully developed blond moved in,cause she was the daghter of one of my mothers friends from the bank,where she worked in the daytime.anyways she was aproblem child,alwys listening to heavy metal music until she discovered cheap trick,and schooled me on what was now cool,new wave she called it and no one was listening to ac/dc or deep purple or yes or ted nugent or black sabbath anymore not even asia!now it was the cars.i didnt buy it, istuck with my faves which turned into an interest in punk rock i listened to local acts like d.o.a. and the subhumans,then i found abuzzcocks record and then i kinda started to listen to the split ends and marvin gaye ,to michael jackson ,back to iron maiden ,def leppard judas priest back to al green ,otis redding solomon burke, lou rawls the manhattans temptations ,miracles,george benson yes it came right back to the roots growin up listening to soul music with mom tellin me stories of stevie wonder concerts and gigs in hawaii with marvin gaye singing distant lover till the sun went down.i still like those groups.i still like the velvet underground ,roxy music ,bowie radiohead,coldplay,blur,stoneroses,are all o.k. but they lack something for me,something a band like oasis doesnt satiate.all my friends are into electronic varieties of music ,which i do like some of,but its been along time since i bought a tangerine dream album or the latest vince clark project.id rather hear the human league one more time.its been so long since i paid money for a album i just couldnt live without,for that matter i havent paid to see a show all year,no thats alie,i saw prince recently,i paid 160 dollars i couldnt beleieve it. the first show i ever seen was michael jackson and the jackson five,that was the first time i ever paid money to watch an act.it was 60 dollars in 1982.both shows were fun and fulfilled my expectations but as my e.i. benefits just ran out recently , idont think i will be going out if it requires any thing more than me showing up with a respectable glow and enough quarters i stole from my grandparents newspaper money jar,just in case i meet a chic who doesnt buy her own drinks,and we all know as i qoute,its good to drink for free when you havent any money.,by the way i have never had a cold bath with someone i dislike so i cant comment,the worst bathing experience was when i was in hawaii with my cousin jimmy when i was 9 yrs old.it was uncomfortable cause we would usually just sit and play with lego and talk about farrah fawcet and video games and street hockey.last time i played sreet hockey was not long ago when a bunch of almost hockey playin pals and i got together for a few pints of canadian beer to watch our boys lay a good old fashioned whoopin to our neighbors down south,it was heaven ,then we played till it got too personal and too dark to see the ball .yep oh i forgot to mention i eventually got regular action from my baby sitter and my mom wondered why i never complained when she had to go to work.nice one!butcher rocks so dont forget or else bad things will happen.there are still some devoted fans here in

In the first, I discovered, with great delight, that I had a box of Jazz Butcher cereal in a cupboard at my mother&#39;s house.  I ate a bowl of it while I listened to Southern Mark Smith.  \r\n\r\nIn the second, I found a Jazz Butcher record including a cover of Sympathy for the Devil.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.\r\n\r\nNext, I dreamt that I was listening to another Butcher record featuring a song all about Sticky Language Goo.  I thought this was absolutely brilliant, and I jealously wished that I had written this song myself.\r\n\r\nLastly, I was taking a psychology class in which the Butcher was the professor.  I realized that I hadn&#39;t been very paying very close attention to the class, and that I would do very poorly on the final exam.  The test asked us to describe the five stages of grief.

All in all a fine gig, the highlight being a spot-on version of &#34;Partytime&#34;, performed graciously after numerous requests from a rabid crowd - &#34;Well, this is a democracy, so I guess we have to play it&#34; was Butch&#39;s comment, I believe.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4024,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3004380,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/1990/Nov14.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"&#34;This is a democracy...&#34;","dtcreated":"2004-06-14T04:54:44.000Z","host":"195.92.67.67","who":"The Butcher","whence":"NN1","comments":"Ah, those were the days.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4027,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3017304,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/big_saturday.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Big Saturday","dtcreated":"2004-06-17T11:59:02.000Z","host":"67.124.137.239","who":"fionamcvey@sbcglobal.com","whence":"Nowhere, CA","comments":"Unrequited love - better than none at all?","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4031,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3028210,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"people/laurence_okeefe.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"dark star &#34;ZURICH&#34;","dtcreated":"2004-06-23T16:17:49.000Z","host":"81.131.147.147","who":"donnymarnock@hotmail.com","whence":"irvine, scotland ka11 1dt","comments":"hi\r\nplease please can anyone get me a copy of second dark star lp on cd!!!!\r\nalso any videos \r\n\r\nDARK STAR SECOND CD?????\r\n\r\ncan anybody help.\r\n\r\ndonnymarnock@hotmail.com","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4032,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3028615,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/when_eno_sings.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"King&#39;s Lead Fish Shark","dtcreated":"2004-06-23T20:51:30.000Z","host":"24.12.163.55","who":"you@24.12.163.55","whence":"YourTown, USofA","comments":"It&#39;s true, you know.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4035,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3031133,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"htdb/index.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"butchie cds","dtcreated":"2004-06-25T01:58:26.000Z","host":"66.81.203.29","who":"you@66.81.203.29","whence":"long beach ca /vancouver BC","comments":"Just to rub it in I have met the man Pat Fish in seattle and have the following on CD:Fishcotheque,\r\nexcellent the violent years,\r\nA scandal in bohemia,\r\nwaiting for the love bus,\r\ndistressed gentlefolk,\r\nFree Lunch,\r\nilluminate x 2\r\ndraining the glass,\r\ncondition blue x2,\r\ncake city,\r\nwestern family,\r\nspooky,\r\nglorious and idiotic,\r\ncult of the basement,\r\nedwards closet\r\nunconditional\r\nrotton soul\r\nwell that about wraps it up.\r\nyou could say I was a fan of the band and that would be correct!","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4036,"parent_id":null,"session_id":3032348,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/1986/Aug12.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"First Club","dtcreated":"2004-06-25T16:42:47.000Z","host":"64.221.164.10","who":"lundquist29@hotmail.com","whence":"San Rafael","comments":"My name is David and attended this show with the other David who mentioned all the drugs.

Dave Barker at Glass signed separate \r\nlicensing deals  with Big Time in the USA and Polygram in \r\nCanada. Polygram were almost unique among Canadian majors \r\nat the time, inasmuch as they weren&#39;t just run as a minor \r\nappendage of the American parent company but actually had a \r\npolicy of their own. Astonishingly, this involved signing the JBC, \r\nas two of the A&R staff up at Polygram had taken a severe shine \r\nto the band. Because of their own personal tastes and, perhaps, \r\na better understanding of the market in the Great White North, \r\nthey changed the tracklisting for the Bloody Nonsense \r\ncompilation. Basically, the version with the mauve cover is the \r\nAmerican issue, the one with the rather nicer deep blue cover \r\nthe Canadian. The US version features the bouncy 45 version of \r\nSouthern Mark Smith with Kevin on the drums and Rolo on the \r\nbass, whereas the Canadian version features the &#34;Big Return&#34; \r\nmix from the Scandal in Bohemia LP with Kevin&#39;s brother David \r\non the bass and Owen on the drums.

Now, in order to do this well, I believe wholeheartedly that not only does one have to be over a certain age, but also to do it with suitable aplomb. This is up there with Bo Diddley. Though the guitar is a little quiet, people really have started to take notice. Some people even start dancing â unheard of in this town.\r\n\r\nJim arrives, fresh off a plane and heading for another. âHellohowmuchhaveIm-â he says quickly before being caught unawares (and entirely silenced&#41; by the opening chords of Southern Mark Smith. Itâs one of my personal faves and tonightâs version entirely does it justice. As if to balance out, new song Shakey is next, one Iâve only ever heard played live â last time I heard it, it sent a shiver through the audience and tonight Pat seems to be investing even more into it; shimmeringly beautiful.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Sniper, a Wilson song is next up and itâs excoriating â angry, driven â the backing tracks really kick in, my hairline takes another involuntary step backwards and the rest of the audience well and truly shuts the fuck up. Itâs hard to know just how heâll follow that, but as some familiar chords sing out, I turn to Jim and ask âis this Caroline Wheelerâs Birthday Present?â â Jim replies but in the excitement he just makes a strange sound as if to say âYES. Now shush!â. Pat must by this time know heâs on a roll but he still seems to be working it just as hard as he can. Itâs another great versionâ¦\r\n\r\nEven if the following cover of John Caleâs Thoughtless Kind fails to move a certain member of the audience, to Chrissy and me certainly it brings a lump to the throat and a welling in the eyes. Last time I heard Pat play this I immediately identified it as a Cale cover; tonight heâs made it entirely his own. After the emotional rollercoaster of the rest of the set, the closer, Shame On You seems bubbly and refreshing and a perfect way to round things off. I turn to Chrissy and convey how much Iâve enjoyed the set with just wide eyes and open mouth. She nods, and adds âgig of the yearâ. I quickly flick through those I can remember, and, true enough, sheâs right!","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4523,"parent_id":null,"session_id":5672958,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/index.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"San Francisco","dtcreated":"2005-11-30T21:33:07.000Z","host":"70.137.169.59","who":"Adam Christensen, achriste@yahoo.com","whence":"San Francisco, USA","comments":"I&#39;ve been a huge fan of the Jazz Butcher for over 20 years and simply must see you guys first hand.

Worth it to catch Anton Barbeau with a full-on band made up of Swindon&#39;s finest. \r\n\r\nAs great as it was, this Antgig in Swindon, it did prevent me from getting my practice on that night and the next. Woke Saturday and realised with some horror that I&#39;d done no practice for this gig at all. Still, I knew we&#39;d play very early and there were more pressing things to worry about - the ever changing face of the Port PA; getting a decent-sized audience out in this dry, angrifying icy rawness; making sure our musical guests were happy...\r\n\r\nI got down to the Port early, hoping that I&#39;d find the PA intact and preferably already set up from the night before... no such luck - it&#39;s in bits, scattered everywhere. Brian and I fight with it for some time before realising that something fundamental was missing. Pat and Russ turn up from Northampton and I&#39;m still fiddling ineffectually with the bloody thing. James Serjeant turns up and confirms our fears in re. the missing bits - thankfully a last minute supply of the correct lead direct from the kind heart of Osprey saves me a savage beating from monitor-hungry blokes with guitars.\r\n\r\nHaving ridden the emotional roller-coaster of a soundcheck without dropping dead of an aneurysm, it was time to take the stage. Nice to see a few people in the audience despite the early hour. Everything goes pretty well - start with a good rendition of Dreamer, Green goes nicely, as does Dark Matter. It&#39;s only when I realise I&#39;ve forgotten to cut my nails and we get to Everything In The Picture that things take a nasty turn. They even seem to grow during the set, Look At The Captain becomes almost impossible to play with werewolf claws and I&#39;m mightily relieved to be in the home straight of Telephones. Pretty well received - Terry&#39;s Camera seemed to get the best reception.\r\n\r\nTime was flying by this time, so Anton and Su were soon setting up. Slight moment of horror as Anton flew into one of his energy drink-fuelled introductory meanderings - I worried that the intros would be long and the songs few... I shouldn&#39;t have done - Anton and Su deliver a beautifully tight set. I can&#39;t get enough of his latest batch of songs and tonight they really do shine. Chrissy mentions how beautiful Su&#39;s voice is and I really have to agree, it&#39;s lovely, sweet and deep... er... I don&#39;t mean deep like she sings bass, I mean with depth... easy to overlook this things with the songs themselves demanding so much of one&#39;s attention. They finish with Banana - sadly I miss the majority of the song and Su&#39;s improvised harmonica solo, Anton creaking the dodgy plank on the edge of the stage for all he&#39;s worth, as I&#39;m trying to round up our headliners. Anton and Su leave the stage to some very warm applause and hopefully a good few sigs on the clipboard.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s our headliners&#39; night though - I knew Pat had a long and special set lined up and he did not disappoint - Sadly without the setlist in front of me I can&#39;t go song-by-song, but he mixed acoustic with electric, live Russell drummer (who has a seemingly magical grip on percussion&#41; and scuff karaoke machine. The acoustic version of Quality People kicks the set off marvellously, another couple of  acoustic numbers before we hear the gentle pitter-patter of dat machines on the window. The arrangements on the DAT machine are brilliant - we&#39;ve got the whole pa cranked up as loud as it&#39;ll go, Jim Davies keeps prodding me and suggesting more vocal (he&#39;s right, as usual&#41; and soon the vocal slider is up as far as it&#39;ll go. \r\n\r\nMr Odd - finally I get to hear my first-ever favourite track from Cult of the Basement! And Southern Mark Smith seems to have a krautrockish, Jaki Liebezeitesque drum pattern that contrasts beautifully with the very human song. Highlight of the set though is Buffalo Sniper - headspinningly great and enough to strip the paint off the very walls. I hope every day for news of the Wilson album, and you should too! All too soon, it&#39;s over, the NN1 posse disappear into the night, I leave the PA intact for the next person to have an easier time of it I hope, and soon Chrissy, Jim, Brian and I are waving to Anton as he makes his way up the hill to home.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s been a wonderful night and, Port PA notwithstanding, I&#39;m wondering how soon we can do this again!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nMatt","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4617,"parent_id":null,"session_id":6412124,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/2006/Mar18.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"set list","dtcreated":"2006-03-22T19:45:43.000Z","host":"195.92.168.165","who":"headstone@wilsondub.com","whence":"the butcher, nn1","comments":"That set list in full:\r\nQuality People\r\nThe Ugliest Song in the World\r\nRegrets of a Spaceman\r\nLand\r\nMister Odd\r\nShame About you\r\nShakey\r\nSouthern Mark Smith\r\nScarlett\r\nBuffalo Sniper\r\nAnother Day on Earth\r\n\r\nThanks for listening,\r\nPat\r\n   xxx","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4618,"parent_id":null,"session_id":5234900,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/big_cats.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Big Cats, of course","dtcreated":"2006-03-23T06:19:47.000Z","host":"129.67.2.57","who":"michael@lonpobty.freeserve.co.uk","whence":"Michael, Oxford","comments":"For all your big cat needs, contact:\r\nhttp://www.britishbigcats.org/index.php","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4620,"parent_id":null,"session_id":4420585,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/big_cats.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"whoppers","dtcreated":"2006-03-26T09:37:11.000Z","host":"81.178.65.96","who":"headstone@wilsondub.com","whence":"the butcher, NN1","comments":"For the view from Northampton, where sightings have risen dramatically over the past couple of years, see: http://www.big-cats.co.uk/articles.htm\r\nPat\r\n   xxx","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4622,"parent_id":null,"session_id":6479309,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"htdb/index.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"pat/max","dtcreated":"2006-03-30T02:22:43.000Z","host":"68.126.124.54","who":"svingolli1@yahoo","whence":"bowie","comments":"wonderfull that you guys are playing gigs, Quit f***ing around England and play the states again.

YouÃ¢â¬â¢re all right-on lefties now, but in five years youÃ¢â¬â¢ll be conservative pigs earning a fortune working in some ivory towerÃ¢â¬â¢, (or something similar&#41;. Of course this probably turned out to be very true for some of the people there, but whatever you werenÃ¢â¬â¢t exactly winning the crowd over.\r\n\r\nMy brother and I were actually quite interested in your performance so wandered down to the front of the stage and stood sipping our beer and watching. Suddenly you jumped off stage and stood right in front of me with your face perhaps six inches from mine, eyeballing. In my head I thought Ã¢â¬ËWhat the fucks going on here? I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know but IÃ¢â¬â¢m not going to lose the staring contest that seems to have ensuedÃ¢â¬â¢. So we probably stood there for maybe 20 seconds eyeballing each other, you still playing your guitar and me continuing to sip my beer. That was until I noticed my brother standing behind you and taking the piss with an air guitar impression. At this point I had no choice but to grin, which obviously gave the game away. You swung around and caught my brother with the head of your guitar, and then some sort of minor scuffle broke about between the two of you, before you jumped back on stage.\r\n\r\nMy brother and I headed back towards the bar. He was a bit angry and unruffled by the incident. At the bar he ordered two more pints for us, and also two pints of slops. He then took the slops, marched down to the stage, and enthusiastically launched them in your general direction, thoroughly soaking you. Following this the rest of the crowd joined in and a rain of plastic beer glasses showered the stage, until you and your band decided it was perhaps time to vacate.\r\n\r\nAs for the music IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure you were very good? I donÃ¢â¬â¢t really remember, but my brother and other friends who attended still laugh about the incident today. \r\n\r\nI doub&#39;t that you&#39;ll print this, but I thought I&#39;d give it a try?","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4697,"parent_id":null,"session_id":7537221,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/1986/Jan17.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"brunel","dtcreated":"2006-09-06T09:05:59.000Z","host":"62.253.32.6","who":"justice@security.com","whence":"mister justice","comments":"twat.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4699,"parent_id":null,"session_id":7635535,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"albums/weloveyou.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"forest","dtcreated":"2006-09-08T09:34:54.000Z","host":"66.203.178.11","who":"jack","whence":"james cornelius","comments":"Today, leaders are expected to be both reassuring and authoritative, emotionally open and tough, empowering and powerful.

I actually worked at Max&#39;s at the time, as the house DJ, and my good friend Mark &#34;The Brunoman&#34; Dixon was the general manager, and booked most of the bands. Max&#39;s still exists, in the quaint wharf area of Fells Point in Baltimore. Back then Max&#39;s was a mecca for solid indie rock, with inviting coolers full of choice bottled imported beer, and a killer soundsystem (as mentioned in the notes for this gig&#41;; now it&#39;s just a smelly cigar sports bar with 52 satellite channels worth of college bowling tournaments pumped in round the clock. We had been rabid, drooling JBC fans for a few years already at that point in &#39;92, during which time Mark had been not-so-subtly exalting the virtues of The Butcher to his brother Steve, who worked for Sky Records in Atlanta, the label that, as kismet would have it, eventually released &#34;Condition Blue&#34;. Needless to say, we were ecstatic, and when the tour was announced, we made damn sure that Max&#39;s was on the tour schedule, eagerly anticipating the date like kiddies awaiting Christmas. The gig itself was fantastic, and the JBC brilliant, but the week itself was tempered with sadness when two members of Atlanta&#39;s The Jody Grind passed away in a horrific car accident. They had played a number of times at Max&#39;s in the year before, and were originally slated to play double-bill on this gig, if I remember correctly. The Jody Grind&#39;s &#34;One Man&#39;s Trash Is Another Man&#39;s Treasure&#34; is an outstanding release (if you can find one&#41;, and sits right next to &#34;Condition Blue&#34; on my shelf, a gentle reminder of a bittersweet year.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4716,"parent_id":null,"session_id":5234900,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"gigs/2006/Dec9_2000.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Biodegradable","dtcreated":"2006-10-27T01:58:35.000Z","host":"129.67.2.51","who":"michael@lonpobty.freeserve.co.uk","whence":"Michael, OX1","comments":"Is there anything in the rumour about Eider and the Shepherd&#39;s Bush Duvet Festival?","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":4717,"parent_id":null,"session_id":7877119,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/shes_a_yo_yo.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"She&#39;s a yo yo","dtcreated":"2006-10-27T14:39:38.000Z","host":"209.165.216.201","who":"dreamtidespress@yahoo.com","whence":"Hail in California","comments":"She sure is the angriest animal ever!

Every time I&#39;ve seen him here he&#39;s delivered something really special and tonight is, unsurprisingly really, no different. He&#39;s dumped the DAT for a far-more portable laptop but kicks off with a few new songs entirely acoustic. Couldn&#39;t You Use a Beautiful Mind (if that&#39;s what it&#39;s called&#41; and Mercy are easily as good as any classic Butcher material.

It does occur to me during though that there are an increasing number of songs that can only be heard live from the man himself - could it be time for a new album? I certainly hope so. It&#39;s a great set though - something edgy and almost uncomfortable about it that adds something, makes sure it&#39;s vital and alive and not some comfy nostalgia-fest. That&#39;s not to say the back-catalogue was entirely ignored - lovely version of Southern Mark Smith in particular. Regrets Of A Spaceman has a beautiful twinkling xylophone in the arrangement, and Buffalo Sniper is just as utterly great as I&#39;ve seen it.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m waiting to hear a personal fave, Mr Odd, that we got in the soundcheck but looks like our man has taken a last-minute detour and we get a gorgeous Sister Death from where he segues into Moon River. From Moon River he goes into an angry coda... I couldn&#39;t identify it, but it&#39;s positively snarled and actually a little scary - the audience is stunned for a moment as our man finishes the song, sweeps off his guitar and disappears behind a curtain.

I had the great pleasure of seeing Pat and friends several times here in Canada.  Good times.  I am also a big music collector and though I spend a great deal of time snooping the corners of the internet and cd shops all over the world I am still without a CD of In Bath Of Bacon, Big Questions Gift of Music vol 2 and the live Hamburg glass era cds.  I NEED them in my collection on cd.  I have them on vinyl and have ripped them to cd but it just ain&#39;t the same.  I have plenty of extra rare JBC to trade ( an extra Scandal In Bohemia / Sex and Travel glass era CD in mint&#41; plus a ton of extra rare jbc vinyl.  It is criminal that this wonderful music is largely out of print.  Anyone want to trade or sell me the goodies I need.  Mr. Fish, is there no chance of future re-issues?  Also while I am voicing my sob stories, why has Grooving In The Bus Lane (Bloody Nonsense version&#41; been released on cd?  Anywho, I just thought I would express my love for all eras of Jazz Butcher material and throw in a rude complaint or two.  Can&#39;t wait to hear more new stuff.  I have Max&#39;s recent cds as well as the new Pat tracks on the Northhampton cd, but do sign me up for more new cds and I would like to second someone else&#39;s suggestion of a fan funded project.

He may perform solo sets, but the Jazz Butcher as a band, well, it seems those days are over. &#39;How many of you like football?&#39; he asked of the faithful. One bloke shouted &#39;yeah&#39; but I bet many there, though not football fans, had watched and enjoyed the recent World Cup. I know I had, and I usually don&#39;t care about football. Anyway, Pat then quoted the well-known footie saying, &#39;leave nothing on the pitch,&#39; which means, well, work it out. He, and the band, then went on to put this into practice by performing a blistering version of Solar Core. Is that enough? &#39;A blistering version of Solar Core&#39;, those six words are simply not enough to describe what we witnessed. Writing about music is like fencing about horticulture.\r\n\r\nHi, I&#39;m Nick Walters, you might know me, I write Doctor Who books and horror stories, I&#39;ve been following The Jazz Butcher since the late 80s, and, as the Thunderbolt is just down the road from me (literally - it takes about 45 seconds to walk there&#41; I thought I might as well pop along. And so I did, in the company of the Emperor Ming, who had popped by to sort out our weather. And he did - it chucked it down for most of the day, providing a welcome, cooling cleansing. Some other famous Bristol people were in attendance - Gerard Langley from The Blue Aeroplanes, and Hazel Winter and Gerard Starkie also from the &#39;planes and The Flux Capacitors (who released their first album Courtesan earlier this year&#41;. I sort of know Gerard L to talk to (I interviewed him last year for a music mag&#41; and also Hazel and Gerard S as I reviewed the Capacitors&#39; album and gig earlier this year. So I could have said Hello! to them but the shyness that overcomes me in social situations took hold; I become convinced they are going to tell me to fuck off. Silly me. They are nice people and it was great to be in their company and in the company of the great Mr Fish and his band.\r\n\r\nAll this talent, splendour and joy, in a little pub just down the road from me, that used to be the Turnpike, a total shithole and drug den! Who&#39;d have thought? \r\n\r\nThe Emperor and I didn&#39;t see the support acts as we had a lot to discuss (Hot Hail, Dale Arden etc&#41; and I coulnd&#39;t stand up for long as my new boots (as work by Ryan Gosling as Officer K in Blade Runner 2049&#41; were killing my feet. But I mastered the pain and managed to stand through the entire 1 hour and 15 minutes or so of the JBC set, go me!\r\n\r\nPat Fish has aged well and now resembles a dapper, suave cross between Bryan Ferry and Peter Capaldi. His eyebrows are a wonder to behold. His voice and guitar playing have only got better. Supporting by a full band this was a full-on sonic experience... writing about music again. I&#39;ll just list some of the songs: Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, Animals, Party Time, Black Raoul, Sister Death, Mr Odd (a personal favourite&#41;, Shirley McLaine, Southern Mark Smith (brought a tear to the eye&#41;, all culminating in the coruscating sonic catherdral (argh&#41; of Solar Core. A quick cool off then an encore, a single song, the quite beautiful Thoughtless Kind by John Cale.  \r\n\r\nAnd then everyone went out into the blissfully, thankfully cool night air for drinks and a chat, and I singularly failed to approach Mr Fish to tell him how much his music has meant to me over the years. Well, I&#39;m saying it now. Hope this won&#39;t be your last visit to the Bolt.\r\n\r\nSo then I began the arduous 45 second trek up the hill to home whilst Ming jetted back to Mongo.

The original lineup after all those decades, and they sounded tight as can be.  Pat told me that someone in Atlanta wanted them as their wedding band & paid for plane flight.  I am eternally grateful for that happy couple, and the band for slogging their way up the east coast.\r\n\r\nWhether it was fate, divine providence, or dumb luck I found the info on the internet the week before.  My 60 year old mom made the suggestion of Philly. Then, Hell DC is only and hour & a half, then home with photos, swag, autographs, and soundboard music copies.  That was when mom hit me with &#34;Want to go to NYC for the finale?&#34;  And off we went.  I think the band was truly surprised to see us.  I&#39;m shocked they remembered us. 2 Baltimorons, and AEUK took a shine to my mother.\r\n\r\nThe show was incredible, having the original members together.  I heard of the JBC on the liner notes of a Bauhaus record as a Davd J. side project and I was hooked.  The set list was the same, but the band played with incredible enthusiasm.  I&#39;m sure others, or I posted the setlist from an earlier show.  They rocked, they rolled, & they even kazooed.  An audience member played bass for Zombie Love at the end.  I wish I could pop by the local pub and catch them every weekend.\r\n\r\nAnyone reading this is doing themselves a disfavor by not seeking out the entire collection.  Including Max&#39;s solo work, starting with &#34;The Best Kisser in the World&#34;  Looking at the photo on the back, it&#39;s clear he had plenty of practice.

Buffalo Shame is one o my favourite songs because it depicts the western expansion of Canada west. One of my heroes is Gabriel Dumont and his buddy Louis Riel. who both tried to defend their stakes on that art of Canada and rebelled Sir John A MacDonald&#39;s sending of troops to allow the rail road to proceed West.\r\nGabriel in particular has been credited with so many battle tactics and was labelled the &#39;last great plains general of the West&#34; Heinz Guderian German WWII General actually used some of Gabriel&#39;s tactics in his game. At Duck Lake one if his best victories vs. 3,000 of Colonel Worsley&#39;s Red coated mounties. He (Gabriel Dumont was alone with a just a few old ladies and men of ages between 82 and 90. They quickly set up &#34;dummies&#34; and fired guns at the troops from various positions to make it look like there was actually more rebels present than there was. Col Worsley called his 3,000 troops to retreat on fear of a giant response from that brave CREW of rebels of just hand full of old folks Metis French Canadians and natives of the plains aged 80 - 90 years.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely *MAGIC* ACCOMPLISHED BY old folks homes participants today dying from Covid-19 because for profit agencies &#34;fucked them up&#34; \r\n\r\nAnd the saying &#39;Age before beauty takes on such a bigger meaning considering what they accomplished!\r\n\r\nHe and Louis fought off Fenian raids (Irish Nationalists&#41; during the 1st Rebellion The &#39;RED RIVER Rebellion OF 1879.

But back to Gabriel and Louis. \r\n\r\nLouis Riel actually made a stealth trip to Ottawa to sit as member for his Manitoba postage stamp Province (locale&#41; without the gendarmes even discovering him to be there! GREAT stuff of legends! Thomas Scott you may recall was hanged for his ORANGEMEN games (can&#39;t recall actually stuff he did&#41; but it was enough to get him hanged.

The US record company failed spectacularly in the business of organising our work permits, visas and so forth. I saw some of the correspondence that they sent to the State Department. It would have embarrassed a teenager. Our people in London got on the case, but by the time the problems were sorted, several of the scheduled dates had already passed. It would have been financial suicide to come over for the few remaining dates. So why did the US record company, which had been so helpful in 1986, fail so miserably in 1987? Simple. The label head had sacked everybody at the label who knew what they were doing. He did this cover up the fact that he was asset-stripping the company and trousering all the cash for himself.

Eventually he saw one that piqued his interest enough for him to approach the proprietor and ask its price, knowing it would be too high. The man smiled and told him to simply take it. Apparently this man, the Jazz Butcher, rented a market stall and filled it with obscure old books just in hopes of attracting kindred souls so he might perhaps meet people to talk about these things he loved so much. \r\nI only met Pat in person once, but that story seems to sum up the person I interacted with online over the years, and had great conversation with over beers that one time. Pat knew he was talented, and his music was, like his personality, understatedly great, but he seemed to mostly delight in cluing people in to other things he found interesting, other people he found congenial. When we met IRL, he was surrounded by a small crowd of locals who all obviously loved and respected him, and he made sure to introduce me to every single one of them. \r\nPat was one of those rare people, the genuinely kind, and we will miss him, but I&#39;m very glad I got to share a world with him for a while. \r\nRest in peace you gentle man.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":5567,"parent_id":null,"session_id":21321354,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"site/memoriam.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Keeping the Curtains Closed","dtcreated":"2021-10-06T18:47:08.000Z","host":"127.0.0.1","who":"richp20@hotmail.com","whence":"Rich Panteluk Calgary Alberta","comments":"I am stunned and saddened by this awful news.

Peel played Ã¢â¬ÅDown the Drain,Ã¢â¬Â and that was basically it. He became a favorite songwriter in less than two minutes. I bought every record and saw him on the Distressed Gentlefolk tour at First Ave in Minneapolis, and a couple of times at Lounge Axe in Chicago. It is in no way an exaggeration to say that his music got me through some very difficult times in the late 80Ã¢â¬â¢s and early 90Ã¢â¬â¢s, but it it also true that his music provided a perfect soundtrack for much happier times. In more recent years I have been surprised and delighted to have Pat comment on several Facebook postings, and have enjoyed little witty conversations with him in this way, whether about my distress at having to buy a beige suit for my youngest brotherÃ¢â¬â¢s wedding, about his music, or the simple observational humor that more or less defined Pat. I told him in one of our exchanges that one of the few good things about the 21st Century was that a devoted fan could have a little personal exchange with a musician he admired so much. And, God knows, one of the only joyous highlights of the pandemic and of the last 18 terrible months have been PatÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬ÅLive from Fishy MansionsÃ¢â¬Â broadcasts. Like many of you, I tuned in on Sunday and was distressed to see Pat looking unwell and talking about problems sleeping. I hoped for a quick recovery and looked forward to this SundayÃ¢â¬â¢s rescheduled broadcast. This morningÃ¢â¬â¢s news was devastating and heartbreaking, Pat was a great songwriter in the grand British tradition of Ray Davies, John Cale, Syd Barrett, Kevin AyersÃ¢â¬âmusicians I love as much as he did. The loss of Pat is a tremendous loss to the world of music and art, and it feels as if I have lost a friend. I was always too intimidated to introduce myself to him when he hung out at the bar at Lounge Axe before his shows. I really wish I had. He was so much more of a genuine and caring human being than I thought it possible for a professional musician to be. Safe travels, Pat.

We will listen again tonight and remember.\r\n\r\n&#34;Snuck&#34; into the backstage area after the JBC show at The Wetlands in NYC on 9/23/99. The lads not only welcomed us, but invited us to join them at a nearby pub for more drinks and laughs. Impossible to keep up with Pat&#39;s wit, but it was sure fun trying. That night hasn&#39;t been and won&#39;t be forgotten.\r\n\r\nMet fellow fans from Chicago at The Wetlands show. One of them managed a small club in Chicago. When the JBC came to Chicago thereafter, we were lucky enough to have been invited to dinner with the band before an intimate show at said club. At one point, I glanced back from a conversation to find my wife leafing through Pat&#39;s notebook!!! The embryos of new songs and ideas were at her fingertips. I asked her quietly, somewhat stunned, if Pat knew she was leafing through his inner most thoughts etc. She said he had asked if she would like to see what he was working on (OK, about as cool as it gets!&#41;. My heart rate returned to normal upon hearing this as I joined her turning pages. Thanks to Pat and all involved for one of our fondest memories.\r\n\r\nRest well Pat.

My brother Alex and I wanted to be Pat and Max, we were obsessed by him and his group. I learned to write songs by copying him, and Alex learned guitar by copying Max. Every school band we were in had its set list backbone made from JB covers.\r\n\r\nI eventually decided I needed to write to the man himself Pat Fish - the only fan letter I have ever written - and - unexpectedly - he wrote back and was really funny and friendly, and we sent each other letters for a bit. And when I went to see him, which I did whenever I could, he always said hello. And if he saw me at other gigs, heÃ¢â¬â¢d come over and say hi, and was always a bloody lovely person to chat to, as well as being a musical hero.\r\n\r\nIn the early 90s, after a band rehearsal, I dragged the rest of our rattly band to the Powerhaus in Islington to see The Blue Aeroplanes (whom I also loved&#41; and the other band guys got tired before the main act - because weÃ¢â¬â¢d been up late being a band - and shied off and went home. But I stayed. And then I got a tap on the shoulder. And it was Pat. And he bought me a pint. And we sat and talked about music for a while. And then the Aeroplanes came on and were great and I was in seventh heaven, with one of my heroes watching a great band. Lovely night.\r\n\r\nAnd then towards the end of the AeroplanesÃ¢â¬â¢ set, Pat leaned over to me and said, Ã¢â¬ÅDo you want to be in the Blue Aeroplanes?Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWhat?Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWe should be in the Blue Aeroplanes. Come on.Ã¢â¬Â\r\n\r\nAnd he led me backstage with an AAA pass and we borrowed two guitars and went on stage with the Aeroplanes and did Tom VerlaineÃ¢â¬â¢s Breaking In My Heart and we were in the Blue Aeroplanes. I was really annoyed the rest of my band had gone home because it was like a mad little dream and there were no witnesses.\r\n\r\nItÃ¢â¬â¢s one of the best nights of my life. Impossibly good fun, and silly, and full of life and drunken glee and love and music.\r\n\r\nIÃ¢â¬â¢m monstrously sad that heÃ¢â¬â¢s gone.\r\n\r\nHe was a bloody lovely chap.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":5591,"parent_id":null,"session_id":21320513,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"site/memoriam.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Fishy","dtcreated":"2021-10-06T21:28:17.000Z","host":"127.0.0.1","who":"pblink@yahoo.com","whence":"Blinky, Northampton","comments":"Pat was my mate.

It was smart, literate pop music with the right touch of silliness and the absurd at times. It also had heart and depth when it mattered. Something I&#39;d been searching for quite awhile. \r\n\r\nNow he&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t have the words to express how much his music meant to me over the years. I feel completely gutted is all I can say. But, I can share a few memories of his music and him:\r\n\r\n- hearing &#34;Death Dentist&#34; on the Rock n&#39; Roll Alternative in 1985. It was the song that hooked me, but hearing &#34;The Human Jungle&#34; a week later reeled me in for good.\r\n\r\n- connecting with new friends through his music in college and later. As was the fashion of the time I made many mix tapes and the Jazz Butcher was almost always included. \r\n\r\n- seeing the Jazz Butcher live for my first time at The Venue in Dallas in 1989. I noticed Pat watching the opening band and my friends and I walked over to say hello. He was charming and gracious. He autographed a slip of paper on which I had a girl&#39;s phone number. &#34;Gentlemen, I do hope it was worth the wait,&#34; he wrote. Sadly I was only able to see him live twice more - at Trees in 1990 and at Liberty Lunch in 1992. \r\n\r\n- Picking up a copy of &#34;Waiting For The Love Bus&#34; in San Antonio in 1993. I listened to it at least four times on my five-hour drive from there to Fort Stockton. &#34;Whaddya?&#34; coming on as the sun set over the desert is one of those perfect moments in my memory. \r\n\r\n- reconnecting with a long lost friend via this site&#39;s message board in the late 90s. As a result of our renewed friendship I met my wife and we&#39;ve been together ever since.\r\n\r\n- having our band&#39;s cover of &#34;The Good Ones&#34; included on the 2000 fan tribute CD. Pat had some very kind words for our admittedly lo-fi take on the track.\r\n\r\n- having Pat hassle me via email for bidding on a Jazz Butcher t-shirt on E-Bay sometime in 2003 or so. He was right. It was too much, but I still wish I&#39;d gotten it.\r\n\r\n- connecting with Pat on Facebook during the pandemic. His Sunday afternoon streams from Fishy Mansions were a welcome bit of light in some very dark times. \r\n\r\n- had planned to visit Northampton with some friends/fellow fans in the summer of 2020. I&#39;d messaged Pat about it and the possibility of having a beer together. He was quite nice about it and said if he was still around he&#39;d love to. COVID of course scuttled those plans. I thought maybe once things were better that could still have happened. \r\n\r\nNow he&#39;s gone. RIP Pat Fish.

I was instantly a fan of the wit, the snark, the heart, and the insanely catchy melodies. My first direct interaction with the man came at Nightstage in Cambridge (Mass.&#41; in May 1992 when I called out for &#34;Who Loves You Now?&#34; and he replied &#34;What a terrible thing to ask a man in my condition!&#34;. Fast forward to 1997 where my wife and I travelled to San Francisco where the JBC was playing (and also we were visiting friends&#41; and somehow we managed to legitimately get ourselves into a meet & greet beforehand; I figured the man would be bored with the same questions about himself so we introduced ourselves and I asked &#34;what is it about Rugby that produces such good droney fuzzy bands?&#34;. Without hesitation, he leaned in conspiratorially and said &#34;the thing about Rugby is .... they&#39;ve got *really good drugs*.&#34; And we were off from there. Later that night, at the show, I was surprised to get a shout-out from the stage. We kept in touch; he stayed at my place a few times when touring through Boston, and I had the pleasure of having all manner of cats walk all over me while I tried to sleep in his lounge. I had the pleasure of seeing him play in the same week that I saw Kate Bush in 2014, and I considered them both just as special. When I moved to England in 2017 I had the absolute pleasure of seeing him more frequently, and was thrilled to get up to NN1 once and see him on home turf. It&#39;s unreal and I&#39;m stunned and deeply sad. He had overcome serious adversity recently and it feels like the proverbial cosmic bad joke to have him taken away. I hope there will be some kind of service or gathering or gig to celebrate his life and music.

One listen and I needed me some JBC. Started with Bloody Nonsense and went from there. What a glorious musical journey. I was fortunate enough to see The JBC in Saskatoon, Seattle and Tokyo, in various decades. They always delivered the goods live and in person. I had to drag friends to the shows. They&#39;d later admit that guy was pretty damn good. I got to meet Pat briefly at a show in Japan. He was gracious and engaging. I told him he was the first rock star I had met in person. He found that humorous. Such a wonderful artist and human being. He will be sorely missed in a world that could use WAY MORE Pat Fish.

Before heading in, I popped in to the adjacent college radio station where I volunteered sometimes to find the resident jazz DJ nervously pacing the hall. He had been asked to introduce The Jazz Butcher - probably because someone mistakenly thought they were a jazz band and also mistakenly thought he - a well-known introvert - would be comfortable getting on stage in front of a few hundred people.\r\nI jokingly said &#34;I&#39;ll do it for you!&#34; and the next thing I knew I was in the green room backstage with Pat Fish & company.  \r\n\r\nI think they were bemused that a teenager was going to introduce/MC their show but they all also treated me with the utmost respect and good-natured hospitality - offering food & drink, coaching me on what to say, etc. When the time came to do my thing I stumbled over a cord on the stage on my way to the mic, and they didn&#39;t even blink.  I would have absolute died of embarrassment had one of them snickered.  \r\n\r\nThey let me hang out backstage for the whole show and then back in the green room with them after.  I was in absolute awe - I adored Bloody Nonsense and had been trying to teach myself some of the songs on guitar.  Pat Fish was completely affable and charming and after hearing so many horror stories about people meeting their musical heroes only to discover what horrible people they really were - well, this experience spoiled me for years and years to come.\r\n\r\n They came through again a year or two later.  This time I showed up with my girlfriend to the sound check to invite them out to the only vegetarian restaurant in town for supper, which they happily agreed to and we had a grand old time.  Pat regaled us of tales of US customs officials analyzing his tooth powder for traces of cocaine, their session in MontrÃÂ©al for Brave New Waves, etc. etc.  \r\nI never forgot the open-hearted kindness he showed me and for years I&#39;ve been meaning to track him down to tell him how much it meant to teenaged me and how important those first few Jazz Butcher albums were to me growing up.

Head down \r\nstrumming at 100mph, hair swinging and swaying \r\nequally fast, during the likes of Diamorphine or \r\nRacheland or numerous other tunes, Max alongside \r\ncreating his joyous wall of sound.

Thank you for all your wonderful music. May God bless and welcome His beautiful, brilliant, and mischievous child.\r\n\r\nMy first introduction to the music of The Jazz Butcher was through a review by Jackson Griffiths in Tower Records&#39; Pulse Magazine. He wrote something to the effect that &#34;Pat Fish is too clever for his own good.&#34; \r\n\r\nMy first listening experience was Big Planet, Scarey Planet. The album was an aural explosion of amazing wordplay and guitars that glistened and thundered. It made me a fan for life.\r\n\r\nAs Pat continued to live and create, I became a bit evangelical about his work. During one of his later tours, I met him and Max in NYC to film a video for &#34;All the Saints&#34;. We filmed in the late but legendary NY venue The Cake Shop and on the roof of the building. Throughout the day, between takes and locations, Pat continually strummed his guitar and sang, like a songbird happy to be alive.\r\n\r\nFrom &#34;Saints Prayer&#34;:\r\n\r\nMay all the saints, who from their labours rest\r\nBeneath the landslide of souls obsessed with right and wrong,\r\nWho dared to stand against the tide,\r\nBe on your side. \r\n\r\nThank you, Pat, for daring to stand against the tide.

Much love to your friends and family.\r\n\r\nThe first Jazz Butcher song I heard was The Human Jungle sometime back in 1986.  A friend at the radio station I DJÃ¢â¬â¢d at lent me a tape.  Who knew that the Butcher would remain such an important part of my life?\r\n\r\nIn 1987 my girlfriend and purchased the Distressed Gentlefolk album together, the first shared purchase of what would become 35 years together.  Angels became Ã¢â¬Åour songÃ¢â¬Â.  And it sounds like so many other peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s too.\r\n\r\nI was lucky enough to see Pat play 2 solo shows in pubs in London in 1988.  I remember a one-eyed man who sat outside the entrance of the first pub who said Ã¢â¬ÅYou here to see the Fish?  DOWNstairssssÃ¢â¬Â¦.Ã¢â¬Â  The second show featured Alan McGee from Biff Bang Pow in a Ã¢â¬Åguitar warÃ¢â¬Â and Pat roared past him during an incredibly heart-felt version of Angels.  He went on a guitar heavy tangent that blew the small dark room away.  Such amazing energy.\r\n\r\nThe Jazz Butcher has always been there.  Mr OddÃ¢â¬â¢s crazy psychedelic guitar solo on a drug-fueled road trip through Kansas, The Best Way reminding us all why its good not to eat our animal friends, Big Saturday ringing in a new year or starting a brilliant Spring day.  And the entire Scandal in Bohemia album on road trips.  My Desert is Waiting.\r\n\r\nThe posts here confirm that Mr Fish was a loving, kind gentleman.  He was a friend to those who knew him and all of us who never got the chance to meet him.  His passing hits hard - because it seems like PatÃ¢â¬â¢s words and music were always present at important moments for many here on this message board.  They certainly were for me.\r\n\r\nDecades after seeing him in the 80Ã¢â¬â¢s - we got to see The Jazz Butcher at the Troubador in LA with the Ã¢â¬Ådream teamÃ¢â¬Â - Pat, Max, David and Kevin (they were probably discussing swimming pools in all the backyards before the show&#41;.  It was a perfect evening and they played with such ease and life and humor.  One of those Ã¢â¬Ëlife-changingÃ¢â¬â¢ shows we all hope for.\r\n\r\nPat wrote such lovely poetry.  Yet infused it with humor and lightness.  There will never be another like him.  His music has been a good friend in hard times.  On one dark night in one particularly difficult year, as Angels played (loudly&#41;, my wife and I clung to one another weeping as Pat reminded us that\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s thousands of them\r\nThey&#39;re bearing you up\r\nThey&#39;re holding you up\r\nI want to hold you in my arms.\r\n\r\nThat night changed the course of our lives.  Thank you Pat.\r\n\r\nAnd as we sat last night - with tears - knocked down a bit - as we listened to an entire celebratory mix of the Jazz Butcher I thought about many things and many memories.  \r\n\r\nPat the man may have left us too soon.  But as a wise man once said, Ã¢â¬Ådo you know what happens when you leave a Fish too long in an elevator?Ã¢â¬Â  Pat left this world a star shining brightly - and - his music is eternal.  It is not biodegradable.  We are all SO lucky to have had his music in our lives.  A good trusted friend in hard times.  A great friend in the best of times.\r\n\r\nThank you Mr Fish for giving, creating and never giving up.","isdeleted":"F"},{"feedback_id":5715,"parent_id":null,"session_id":21372091,"session":null,"domain_id":11,"uri":"lyrics/blues_for_dean_read.html","ordinal":0,"subject":"Wow","dtcreated":"2021-10-17T20:02:42.000Z","host":"127.0.0.1","who":"okschuler@gmail.com","whence":"Carol, Lansing MI","comments":"Clearly that was me posting about Comrade Rockstar, and I have NO MEMORY WHATSOEVER of it.

Our small group of loyal \r\nfollowers traveled up and down the East Coast of \r\nthe USA , throwing post-gig Ã¢â¬Åbathroom Ã¢â¬Å parties \r\nwith Pat and his co-conspirators in attendance. \r\nThe times we spent with Pat between Ã¢â¬â¢89 and 2000 \r\nare among the very best in my 55 years on the big \r\nplanet. Without a fraction of hyperbole I say Pat \r\nwasnÃ¢â¬â¢t just a singer/songwriter/musician.

My wife and I were lucky enough to \r\nspend a day and night with Pat at his home in \r\nNorthampton in 1994. What a gracious host he was. \r\nWe drank, smoked, laughed, listened to records, \r\nlooked through photos in his scrapbooks, and \r\ncontinued the drinking on a pub crawl.

One \r\nthing I would always do is pop by The Jazz \r\nButcherÃ¢â¬â¢s Website every couple of months or so to \r\nsee what he was up to & hoping to get good news \r\nabout Ã¢â¬ÅJazz Butcher Singles & RaritiesÃ¢â¬Â would \r\nsomeday see the music finally released on CD after \r\nall these years of waiting.\r\n\r\nWell in the middle of November I found out the Sad \r\nNews that Pat Fish had passed away & the \r\nBittersweet News that Ã¢â¬ÅDr Cholmondley Repents: A-\r\nSides, B-Sides and SeasidesÃ¢â¬Â had just been \r\nreleased in the UK.\r\n\r\nI first stumbled upon the Jazz Butcher at Ã¢â¬ÅSam the \r\nRecord ManÃ¢â¬Â back in 1986. There were 2 Domestic \r\nReleases that just hit the Record Stores in Canada \r\nwhich were Ã¢â¬ÅBloody NonsenseÃ¢â¬Â which was a \r\ncollection of A & B Sides released in the UK & \r\nÃ¢â¬ÅDistressed GentlefolkÃ¢â¬Â which also included the \r\nBonus LP Ã¢â¬ÅConspiracyÃ¢â¬Â. Both releases had \r\nexcellent Ã¢â¬ÅHandwritten ReviewsÃ¢â¬Â from \r\nmembers of SamÃ¢â¬â¢s Staff & my brother Ken who was \r\nwith me at the time told me Ã¢â¬ÅThe Jazz Butcher; you \r\nwould like his music as he is a lot like Ã¢â¬ÅLloyd \r\nColeÃ¢â¬Â Well, I found out he was nothing like Ã¢â¬ÅLloyd \r\nColeÃ¢â¬Â but it was still one of my best Musical \r\nRecommendations that I ever received.\r\n\r\nÃ¢â¬ÅDistressed GentlefolkÃ¢â¬Â I had never heard an album \r\nthat managed to blend pop, rock, blues, folk, \r\nsmooth jazz, western stomp, ragtime & a touch of \r\nsoul all on Ã¢â¬ÅOne Record.Ã¢â¬Â The album even ended \r\nwith one of the most Gorgeous Ballads you may have \r\nnever heard Ã¢â¬ÅAngels.Ã¢â¬Â When I listened to the bonus \r\nLP Ã¢â¬ÅConspiracyÃ¢â¬Â I found out the Ã¢â¬ÅJazz ButcherÃ¢â¬Â \r\ncould also Ã¢â¬ÅRapÃ¢â¬Â better than a lot of that stuff \r\nthat we hear on Ã¢â¬ÅMainstream Music RadioÃ¢â¬Â these \r\ndays. I Later picked-up Ã¢â¬ÅBloody NonsenseÃ¢â¬Â which \r\nwas a Ã¢â¬ÅGlorious Mixed BagÃ¢â¬Â of Music from Ã¢â¬ÅSmart \r\nFast Witty PopÃ¢â¬Â to Ã¢â¬ÅPunk RockÃ¢â¬Â of Ã¢â¬ÅCaroline \r\nWheelerÃ¢â¬â¢s Birthday PresentÃ¢â¬Â & the Ã¢â¬ÅBakersfield \r\nCountryÃ¢â¬Â of Ã¢â¬ÅThe Devil is My Friend.Ã¢â¬Â I LOVED IT \r\nALL Ã¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â¦\r\n\r\nBack in 80Ã¢â¬â¢s there was Ã¢â¬ÅNo InternetÃ¢â¬Â, so we had to \r\nshop for Ã¢â¬ÅRecordsÃ¢â¬Â the Ã¢â¬ÅOld Fashioned WayÃ¢â¬Â. We had \r\nto go Downtown & look for them. I wanted to get my \r\nhands on those previous Ã¢â¬ÅJazz Butcher RecordsÃ¢â¬Â \r\nthat were only available as Ã¢â¬Åimports.Ã¢â¬Â In Toronto \r\nyou did not always find those Records at Ã¢â¬ÅSam the \r\nRecord ManÃ¢â¬Â we would look for those at Ã¢â¬ÅThe Record \r\nPedlar.Ã¢â¬Â I did not find them all, but I did \r\neventually find a copy of Ã¢â¬ÅIn Bath of BaconÃ¢â¬Â which \r\nwas the first Album Ã¢â¬ÅThe Jazz ButcherÃ¢â¬Â ever \r\nreleased back in 1983. When I got home & played \r\nthe Record, I was upset to find a Ã¢â¬ÅLittle ScratchÃ¢â¬Â \r\non the first track; not enough to cause the Record \r\nto Ã¢â¬ÅSkipÃ¢â¬Â but I had to listen to the Ã¢â¬ÅClick, Tick, \r\nClick, TickÃ¢â¬Â for about 20 seconds or so on the \r\nRecord. The rest of the record played fine, but I \r\nnever returned the Album to Ã¢â¬ÅThe Record PedlarÃ¢â¬Â as \r\nI thought that I would Ã¢â¬ÅNeverÃ¢â¬Â get another Copy \r\never again?\r\n\r\nI had a ticket to see The Jazz Butcher play the \r\nÃ¢â¬ÅRivoliÃ¢â¬Â back in the Summer of 1987, but I never \r\ngot to experience that Intimate Show as the Show \r\ngot cancelled a couple of weeks prior to the date. \r\nIt might have been the Ã¢â¬ÅGreatest ShowÃ¢â¬Â that I \r\nnever experienced; instead, my first Ã¢â¬ÅJazz Butcher \r\nShowÃ¢â¬Â came in June of 1988 & I was accompanied by \r\nmy Ã¢â¬ÅBand of Merry MatesÃ¢â¬Â who had also just left \r\nFamily Nest around that time in our lives. \r\nUnfortunately, it turned out to be one of Ã¢â¬ÅThe \r\nWorse ConcertsÃ¢â¬Â that I ever attended as the Sound \r\nwas Ã¢â¬ÅHorribleÃ¢â¬Â The show was at RPM. You may have \r\nan RPM Ã¢â¬ÅHorror ShowÃ¢â¬Â of your own? I never liked \r\nthat venue & glad it is Long Gone. The Jazz \r\nButcher did return to RPM again in November of \r\n1989 & so did I, but my Ã¢â¬ÅBand of Merry MatesÃ¢â¬Â did \r\nnot. That show was better, but it was still RPM \r\n(later The Gouvernment&#41;. The Magical Show finally \r\nhappened in November of 1990 at Ã¢â¬ÅThe DiamondÃ¢â¬Â & \r\nthen the final show Ã¢â¬ÅThe Jazz ButcherÃ¢â¬Â ever played \r\nin Toronto was in the Summer of 1992 at Ã¢â¬ÅThe El \r\nMocomboÃ¢â¬Â, which was another great show.\r\n\r\nThe Music never stopped, but The Record Company \r\nÃ¢â¬ÅPulled the PlugÃ¢â¬Â on Ã¢â¬ÅJazz Butcher Domestic \r\nReleasesÃ¢â¬Â & of course there were no more Tours on \r\nthis side of the Pond either. I still Loved & \r\nFollowed his Music, even though I had to pay those \r\nfew extra Dollars for those Ã¢â¬ÅImport ReleasesÃ¢â¬Â \r\nthrough the rest of his career. The very last \r\nÃ¢â¬ÅJazz Butcher AlbumÃ¢â¬Â released in 2012 was Ã¢â¬ÅLast of \r\nthe Gentleman AdventurersÃ¢â¬Â It was a Ã¢â¬ÅFan FundedÃ¢â¬Â \r\nRecord.

During a break, Pat walked to the bar to grab what must have been a pilsner. I was walking away with one in hand. We passed each other and I think I said something like &#34;Hey, Pat.

I picked up an LP version of Bloody Nonsense while a student at Michigan State in the mid 80s, and was hooked.  Had the good fortune to see the JB at Schubas in Chicago in 2000 (fantastic show&#41;, but my luck hit it&#39;s zenith in 2010 when my family and I traveled to London for a spring break vacation.  On a whim, I reached out to him through the site, asking if there was any way I could have him come to London to perform for us.  Stayed at the Andaz in East London, and I visited a pub the night before to ask the manager if we could come by with Pat to watch him perform there.  He said as long as we ate and drank there, that would be fine.  He showed up in the hotel lobby the following night, right on time, wearing a black suit and his guitar in hand.  Lovely guy, and we made our way up to the room to chat.  Told him of my plan to use the pub, and he agreed, so we walked over.  I believe it was a Monday night, and the place was packed, so it was determined to not be suitable for us to stay, we we had some drinks and food, and headed back to the hotel.  For the next few hours, he entertained us in our room with his acoustic guitar, playing standards and taking requests from me.  I had brought along all of my JB CDs and he autographed them all, drinking Becks beer throughout the evening (when I asked him what kind of beer he favored, he said &#34;anything of German stripe.&#34;  I had a good friend from Wales with me, who is the same age as Pat, and he loved it as well.  At one point, they broke out in song with the old &#34;Hitler, has only got one ball, the other, is in the Albert Hall...&#34;  It was fucking fantastic.  When the evening ended, he graciously thanked me for having him and made his way into the night on a train to Northampton.

I'm going through the same thing as you 6 months ago. I honestly believed that Pat Fish was indestructible and that I could talk to him one of these days... I only just learned of his death. I saw him several times in concert in the 80s (I kept all the tickets) and once in 94, in Toulouse. Like many of you, I cherish a few fragments of space-time shared with him. Here are 2 of them: When I met him for the first time (in 1987, after the Tours concert), A Scandal in Bohemia had been playing on my turntable for months. It was the time when I started a band with a friend just because I dreamed of one day opening for The Jazz Butcher (which never happened). I loved his music, and I had a great love story with him in my head. Everyone made fun of me. That evening, when he dedicated La Mer to me during the concert, I almost passed out. The friends who had asked for this dedication without warning me then dragged me backstage, and I found myself face to face with my hero. I have lost all my means; I was paralyzed. Since I didn't speak a word of English, I just looked at him goofily. He had the elegance not to laugh and he very courteously carried on the conversation on his own (and in French, too). I have dazzling memories of it. I saw Pat in concert again in 1994, in Toulouse. I was much more relaxed than in 1987, and I was doing a little better in English. When he asked me what happened to my group, I was able to tell him in the language of Shakespeare that I had been kicked out like someone dirty. FIRED! I still had a lot on my plate; but that evening, thanks to Pat, I managed to laugh at this distressing episode. I missed his last concert in Paris, in 2019. I missed the Fishy Mansions Sessions when they were broadcast. I did not see the announcement of his death. Since 2018, I have no longer been able to access my old Facebook account, the one thanks to which, in the 2010s, I became friends again with the great Pat Fish. And in recent months, I have done everything to avoid social networks. But I was planning to send him an invitation from my new account as soon as I felt better. Today I feel like my heart has been ripped out. I think very much of his loved ones, of his pocket tiger and of all those who knew him and who love his music...

I first discovered JBC in 1989 when I was in graduate school and bought a CD copy of Big Planet Scarey Planet on a whim. That led to multiple years of trying to assemble a complete collection. I saw them for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis in 1992. Years later in 1999 I flew from Chicago to San Francisco to see the early lineup at the Great American Music Hall, and met a number of fine people from the (at the time&#41; mailing list. I still have my CD copy of the show recorded at the Crocodile Club in Seattle a few nights later. Then the next year I was fortunate to have that same lineup play in Chicago at Shubas, which was such a wonderful time. JBC was a big part of my musical life for decades, and I&#39;m truly sorry to hear of Pat&#39;s passing.

My cousin included him in a playlist of other bands from the eraÂ â some of whom became mainstream, while others did not. Pat and The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy remain one of the most influential of my lifetime, right next to icons like David Bowi;.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to see Pat and David J play at Seattle&#39;s The Crocodile in the aughts. It was one of the highlights of that decade, let alone my life. I even saved a torn scrap of the show poster I pulled from the bathroom wall. That scrap of paper now lives in a tiny wooden box where I keep mementos from the most influential, pivotal moments of my life.\r\n\r\nPat Fish, I never met you personally. We were never friends. But you had an outsized impact on my life. You were there at parties. You were there on road trips. You were with me when I missed my friends and family. And you were there at the most heart-wrenching moments of my life. I know you&#39;re out there somewhere â playing a hollow-body on a cloud with reverb echoing among the stars. You weren&#39;t a simple person. You weren&#39;t a saint. But you made beautiful, witty music that helped a lot of people âÂ helped me âÂ through some really wonderful and hard times. Your creativity will be missed.","isdeleted":"F"}]}
