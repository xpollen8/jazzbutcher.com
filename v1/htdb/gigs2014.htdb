			stand-up bass by Steve New, both of whom used to back Tom Hall, among many other things. There is also a very cool trumpet player called Simon, whose
			other name I don't even yet know! The deal with this line-up is that we intend, wherever possible, to play entirely acoustic! (It sounds fabulous.) We
			play almost all the "Gent Advent" album along with a few JB oldies like Shirley Maclaine, a few new originals and a few old-time loungecore classics
			like Slim Gaillard's "Dunking Bagels" for instance.
