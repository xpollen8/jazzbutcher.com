# Welcome Conspirators

We need some help archiving various bits that have been identified.

In the [Issues](https://github.com/xpollen8/jazzbutcher.com//issues), you'll find a virtual TODO list.

## How To Help

- Create a github.com account
- Ask to be invited to this repository

## And Then..?

Once you are a member of this repo, the workflow usually looks like this:

- There's an "Issue" created, which describes the task

- Find a task.
  Currently, most of the Issues are simply "Go to this URL and grab the stuff"

- That "stuff" needs to be stored somewhere, and we'll have
      to sort out the permissions so that conspirators can dump the
      media/pics/etc directly on the Amazon S3 storage bucket used by jazzbutcher.com
     
- Mark the Issue as "ready for review"

## OF PARTICLUAR INTEREST

Much activity is occurring on the closed-world of Face\*\*k/Meta. Let's not forget the lesson of MySpace.

Many things, I understand, are being shared there, and copies really, really, need to stored elsewhere.

Not just media, but ancedotes, histories, etc.

_All of these are important_

If you have access to this material, please open Issues and attach salvaged images (no screenshots, plz, unless that's all there is),
with proper provenance/attribution.


## Any assistance is sincerely appreciated!
