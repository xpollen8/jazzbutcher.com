			I found The Jazz Butcher on 10 February 1987 for a duo concert with Alex at the Rex Club where I accompanied Alan McGee. That evening, they actually played Chinese envoy, but Sweet Jane, Roadrunner and my favorite of the Butcher Water and The Sea. As Pat Fish confirmed in a <a href="${jbc_press}/2002_apollox.html">hilarious interview Apollox Magazine in 2000</a> , the sole purpose of Alan throughout the evening, which continued at the restaurant and in some deserted little locomotive which still hung out Philippe maneuver and Martin Gore was to convince Pat to record for Creation. Apparently successfully, since a few months later came out Fishcotheque Creation, my favorite of The Jazz Butcher album, even if Creation has not been for the success of the wonders Butcher expected.
