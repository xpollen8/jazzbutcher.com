	It's the coldest night of the year in our town.
	<br/>Here at the back of the night they don't even bother to advertise.

	<br/>We turn our backs on the world outside for higher considerations,
	<p />
	Like the lies we believed because we wanted to.
	<br/>And all the lies we told.
	<br/>And Angel Station is still closed.
	<p />
	Unfair or unfortunate?
	<br/>Here at the back of the night I'm not sure we still care.
	<br/>You want a human interest story?
	<br/>Wanna get down underneath?
	<br/>Ah everytime you're picking on a human interest story,
	<br/>You'll just end up losing teeth.
	<p />
	'Coz there are lies you believe because you wish them true
	<br/>And there are lies you're told.
	<br/>And Angel Station is still closed.
	<br/>Angel Station is still closed.
	<p />
	All the lies you believed because you wanted to,
	<br/>And all the lies you told.
	<br/>Now Angel Station is still closed.
	<br/>Angel Station is still closed.
	<p />
	Yeah there's chickens coming home
	<br/>But the station is still closed.
	<br/>Ah let it all come on home
	<br/>The station's staying closed.

	This station's closed.

	<br/>I've seen the angels and the things they do and every one
	<br/>Just makes me think of you.
	<br/>So come on.
	<p />
	Making jokes and wearing black
	<br/>And wearing black and wearing black
	<br/>And they're right and good and wearing black

		Written on the morning that news broke about
		Reagan's bombing of Tripoli.
		--NEXT--
		This is still one of my favourites. I wrote it in 1986 (the day they bombed Tripoli, in fact) about things that would only come to pass three years later. Or something. Oh God, I never make any sense when I start to talk about this tune. The lyrics just showed up, like automatic writing or something. I love it anyway, and I hope you love it too.

	You've been away for a long, long time and I like it.
	<br/>Why don't you take a match to a petrol pump and strike it?
	<br/>Head-first through the bathroom door:
	<br/>Hit me harder, hurt me more:
	<br/>Drive your van round to my place,
	<br/>Tear my clothes and slap my face.
	<p />
	If you said there was another way I would take it.
	<br/>If you'd let me keep you photograph I'd break it in two.
	<br/>Dream lover - what about it, dear?
	<br/>Dream lover - oh, get out of here!
	<br/>I'm in the backroom with a girl I adore
	<br/>And she puts her arms around me and we sink into the rug,
	<br/>And then
	<p />
	You come walking through the wall,
	<br/>Like you just don't care at all.
	<br/>You're an insubstantial doll - bad dream lover, go away.
	<br/>And even though I'll try till my brains are fit to fry.
	<br/>You're always there close by - bad dream lover, go away.
	<p />
	You're the one who said you never would desert me.
	<br/>But you only ever stick around to hurt me more.
	<br/>You were the girl that I never really had.
	<br/>I had to watch as slowly you went mad.
	<br/>Bad luck, evil eye, voodoo spirit in the sky,
	<br/>Yours for five bucks from a company in Oregon
	<p />
	And you come walking through the wall.
	<br/>You're a supernatural doll - bad dream lover, go away.
	<br/>And you keep on coming through, thought I'd seen the last of you.
	<br/>What am I supposed to do?  Bad dream lover go away.
	<p />
	I saw the doctor and the priest and they said "don't waste my time".
	<br/>You've really got me beat, I'm reaching for my heater..
	<p />
	Just then you come walking through the wall.
	<br/>Like you just don't care at all.
	<br/>You're an insubstantial doll -  bad dream lover, go away.
	<br/>It's evil and you know, but I just can't make you go.
	<br/>You're going to bring me low - bad dream lover, go away, and away.

		Bakersfield is a place a couple of hours north of Los Angeles where seekers after Purity Of Tone stand in the desert and watch drag racing before cruising the bars of this fine and patriotic borough, and maybe stopping by at one of its lifestyle motel complexes. This particular tune was inspired by a conversation in Boardner's Bar, Hollywood, with Iain O'Higgins and Cole Coonce of the Braindead Soundmachine, whose subsequent attempts to lend decency to the whole concept are never going to wash with this writer.

In the time between the recording and the release of this tune a similar incident occurred in New York. I didn't catch the name this time.

The voice at the beginning of “The Best Way” has
bothered me for years. It seemed naggingly familiar, but I couldn’t
place it.
<p />
It turns out it’s Bob Steele, and he’s familiar because when I was a
kid, it was his voice I’d be listening to for school closing
announcements.
<p />
Furthermore, Waybest Foods was located pretty much spitting distance
from my house. And “the philosopher, Ken Morgester” who Steele mentions
is the father of my high school classmate, Candice Morgester, who
confirmed with her mother that Steele knew him.  Trying to find some
info about her father...
<p />
I finally took the radical action of asking friends if they recognized
the voice. After that, it took only about a couple hours for the info to
come out of the woodwork.
<p />
Bob Steele dominated morning radio in southern New England for decades,
most of it on WTIC in Hartford. As a kid, I didn’t listen to much news
radio, but he’s the one we’d tune into for snow day information. He
semi-retired in 1991, but continued hosting a Saturday morning show
until he died.

	It was a dark and stormy night
	<br/>There was someone making noises in the flat next door
	<br/>It could give anybody a fright
	<br/>If they didn't know who lived in the flat next door
	<p />
	Oooh, I ask you
	<br/>Oooh, it could be anybody...
	<p />
	It was hell in the club last Friday
	<br/>People were dancing when the lights went out
	<br/>I mean a girl could get into trouble
	<br/>If she couldn't see the face of the boy next door
	<p />
	I said, ooh, it could be a travelling salesman or something like that
	<br/>Oooh, it could be hell on earth, honeychile, it could be Count Dracula
	<p />
	I knew as soon as I got there, I shouldn't have gone
	<br/>The hallway was spooky, with no lights on
	<br/>There was a squeaking of bats, and a rattle of chains
	<br/>And nobody would stay there if they had any brains
	<br/>But I was told it was a party, and I have no shame
	<br/>Though I shouldn't be there, just the same
	<br/>There was a ring of a bell, like a bell from hell
	<br/>A wolf in the corner and a horrible smell
	<br/>A coffin in the building kept banging around
	<br/>Yeah and an evil stench and an eviler sound
	<br/>I saw a man with red eyes, like he drank too much
	<br/>And a couple of girls you wouldn't ever want to touch
	<br/>There's stuff on the wall like what the devil wrote
	<br/>There's a load of evil mothers yelling "go for the throat"
	<p />
	It was Dracula time
	<br/>And that's time to go
	<br/>It was Dracula time
	<br/>And that's bad as you know
	<br/>(x2)
	<p />
	He looked me up and down and then he showed me his fangs
	<br/>He was just about to go and then he sang
	<br/>"I'm at war with this place
	<br/>I'm going to blow this place up
	<p />
	I'm at war with my face
	<br/>I want to blow my face up

		Southern Mark Smith and Jazz Butcher -v- Count Dracula were recorded in the summer of 1983 in a place called Wellingborough, a small town in the middle of England where even the children are scarey! "Hey, mister, can you SEE in them glasses?" I get to sing and play things like guitar, sax and piano. Max does the electric guitar. On bass is Rolo McGinty, and Princess Alice Thompson plays the organ. They're both in the The Woodentops now, a group internationally recognised as being the shortest collection of pop musicians in the world. Playing the drums is Kevin Haskins, a charming neighbour of mine, and veteran of the Bauhaus conspiracy. Miaowula!

Lexicographical note: to anyone who finds the juxtaposition of the words "Beirut" and "filth" a tad obvious, I would just say that "filth" is an agreeable little lowlife term that one uses in London to describe our wonderful police force.

What started out as an innocent-enough Mary Perry joke on Bath Of Bacon (the "real" first L.P.) took an ugly turn when somebody wrote in and told me that it had actually happened to a friend of his.

		"Jefy Is Five" is one of a number of Harlan Ellison story-titles that litter the lyrics to the song that bears his name. Like:
		<p />
		"Time's A-Wastin'"<br/>
		"I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream"<br/>
		"A Boy And His Dog"<br/>
		"Alone Against Tomorrow"
		<p />
		It's what I call a T-Rex Letter. You know, where fans of a group write a letter about that group, quoting all their song titles? One of those. In an introduction to one of his collections, Mr. Ellison writes that he tells these stories to tell people that "You Are Not Alone"... because we're ALL IN THE SHIT TOGETHER!
		What a dude!
		<p />
		He does, incidentally, keep his number in the L.A. phone book. That line is true. So, I should warn you, is the one about his not suffering fools. He is an impatient man, and should not be approached for quotable quotes on the subject of the JBC by those who could do without being told to... uh... go someplace else.

I was coming out of a good big meal washed down with wine at my parents' house. With nothing else to do, I returned home and started playing a chord suite used in Stairway to Heaven . For three or four hours, I worked on this damn thing, to conclude, at tea time, that it was really young music, useless and pretentious, and that it was better that I pass to something else. Released, I started to strum the A minor and the MI, in the very basic way of Patrick Fitzgerald, a punk songwriter, quite popular at the time. At that time, I was also listening to Charles Trenet and Jean Sablon a lot , and, for some reason, La mer came to me. Suddenly, I remembered all those crazy little songs we were taught at school, to make us learn French. Most of these songs were about elephants in one way or another. I started with this crazy literal translation of The sea comes in, the sea goes out . I stopped for a moment and laughed, “You can't do that!”, a usual thing in my writing process. And, in a few minutes, in a very strange way, the whole scene went by, in French in the text. After having struggled for hours, the sea was writing itself, in ten minutes. To be honest, I didn't think anyone, after that lonely Sunday afternoon, would ever hear this song, and certainly not in France! When we first performed there in 1986, the band asked me if we were going to play La Mer . “ Are you crazy? We're going to get killed! ” . This shows how wrong we can be. Best regards, Pat x ”.

		 I guess you could say that this was the first jazz butcher song ever written. This recording is almost ten years old now. I find it staggering, but there are hundreds of people out there (I've seen them) on whom the irony has yet to take effect. Perhaps it would help them to know that the events described in this song ended up with the writer in hospital. We all like a laugh, though, don't we?

A photo appears in a magazine in Florida showing the Grand Wizard of the local chapter of the KKK in full drag: he is eighteen. A drawing appears in a British newspaper depicting John Major strangling Norman Lamont with his underpants. Can being The President's man help your self-esteem? Your sex life?

		Not inspired by Neil Gaiman or Anne Rice, thank you.

		The inspiration for this tune, initially, came from St. Francis of Assisi. You know the chap - "Hello, brother donkey. Hello, Sister Milkfloat..." Big in the world of Poor-But-Honest Christianity. Got made a saint...
		<p />
		Well, according to some source or other to which I was exposed under education, his last words were "Come, Sister Death..."
		<p />
		There you go. Beyond that, the lyric was written very quickly and without much conscious thought, which means that it's The Real Stuff (as it were). It also, however, means that - since I was listening to Big Star's 3rd LP an awful lot round that time (Dec. '89) - I nicked the "get me out of here" line wholesale from Night Time.
		<p />
		St. Francis, Alex Chilton and Yer Actual Life - those are the main constituents. I've never seen Sandman. I did read a little Anne Rice, but I thought it was a tad... muddled, if you like. She seems to make the rules of Being Undead up as she goes along. Having been raised on Uncle Terry's vampire pictures since the age of about six, I feel that i know the rules, and cling to what I learned as a youth. Don't forget, folks - after you stake 'em, you got to CHOP OFF THE HEAD, or it ain't nothing but a sequel in the works.

		Southern Mark Smith and Jazz Butcher -v- Count Dracula were recorded in the summer of 1983 in a place called Wellingborough, a small town in the middle of England where even the children are scarey! "Hey, mister, can you SEE in them glasses?" I get to sing and play things like guitar, sax and piano. Max does the electric guitar. On bass is Rolo McGinty, and Princess Alice Thompson plays the organ. They're both in the The Woodentops now, a group internationally recognised as being the shortest collection of pop musicians in the world. Playing the drums is Kevin Haskins, a charming neighbour of mine, and veteran of the Bauhaus conspiracy. Miaowula!

		Well, the JBC really did get a big return off this one. It opened a lot of doors for us in Europe and America, and listening back now I think I can see why. No, I mean that Hammond...
		;;<b>Unconditional</b> liner notes;;/albums/unconditional.html#smith;;
		--NEXT--
		All right, here's the thing. The phrase came up some time in conversation
		and was duly seized upon. I think that it may well have been some
		kind of reference to Gerard Langley. We'd been to see the
		Aeroplanes quite early on in their career on account of a review
		in the NME written by our pal Campbell Stevenson, which went under
		the headline: "Exploding! Plastic! In Bristol???"
		But, you know, Mark E. Smith is so steroptypically northern that
		the very phrase "southern Mark Smith" comes across to me like "lush
		Sahara"or "wise and noble Bush". So there's that too.
		<p />
		The tune got "written" into a tape recorder during the BBC evening
		news broadcast on Easter Sunday 1983.  References to Lady Di had
		already been excised by the time we recorded the single version, which was at
		the beginning of September 1983. Ah well."
		<p />
		Good. There's that one wrapped up in a tidy little package. Now
		if someone cares to explain "I Need Meat"...
		<p />
		<b>A little later...</b>
		<p />
		I saw a bit of correspondence on the site about this "Southern Mark Smith" business. Our dear friend
		Mister Berman appears to have had a fair stab at explaining what may or may not have been on my mind
		at the time (it is, frankly, not much use asking me at this advanced stage of the game...), but then
		another fellow (Hank, is it?) steps in with some rather more speculative stuff about one "McGinty".
		<p />
		Our pal is referring to "Pat, Trip Dispenser", which was the b-side to the Fall's single "C.R.E.E.P."
		Towards the end of the tune, things go quiet and Mister Smith is heard intoning (and I write from
		memory) "McGinty thought he could fool the Fall with his imitation speed!" (My memory is about 100%
		on this one, though.)
		<p />
		Now, "C.R.E.E.P." came out not long after we had recorded "Southern Mark Smith". Somebody at JBC
		Central (Mitch?) brought home a copy. We heard the b-side and were struck down with fear, for we
		ourselves were not sure whether somebody was having a pop at our gang (with Lolo Mcginty) or not. The
		man on the website clearly felt the same way, for he writes authoratitively for anyone who is paying
		attention that the McGinty hereinabove referred to was indeed the talented wee monkey boy who played
		bass for us.
		<p />
		You can see what is going on here - there is a "Pat" in the title, a "McGinty" in the lyric and it
		came out about the same time as our "Smith" record. You can see the way that Hank's mind is working
		here, can't you, Mister Holmes?
		<p />
		Trouble is...it's not right. "Pat, Trip Dispenser" was already in the can before the Fall even heard
		our record. It is therefore definitely NOT an "answer record" to "Southern Mark Smith". And, as ever,
		the clue is in the title. Those who know the history of the Fall well will tell you that the song is
		in fact a blast at infamous Manchester dealer, Pat McGinty. (Oh yeah - Pat, Trip Dispenser!) There
		had been a bit of customer dissatisfaction on the band's part, and this was their way of getting back
		at the naughty pharmacist (no, don't start...)
		<p />
		So there you have it. Not the JBC, but some dodgy Mancunian c***.
		Hope that clears things up.

	<br/>`If there's a God how come there's so much suffering going on?'
	<br/>And the answer was nothing at all
	<br/>Spend a little time in the kitchen making up a sandwich
	<br/>And he never got to eat it at all
	<br/>Thought about the sandwich,
	<br/>Thought about the T.V. and thought about his relatives
	<br/>And he never thought about nothing at all

	Sarah lived the other side of town
	<br/>In a white shirt in the old flat that the landlord used
	<br/>To make a little extra money
	<br/>She'd get home from work in the evening,
	<br/>Turn on the T.V. 'bout 6PM and she
	<br/>Ha! She saw nothing at all
	<br/>Used to read it in the evening paper
	<br/>Where to go to meet friends in a strange town
	<br/>But she never did nothing at all

	Round about the time that Whitfield thought about his relatives,
	<br/>Sarah took a big decision and it
	<br/>Led her to nowhere at all

	So they met on a tuesday evening just by chance
	<br/>Thought that maybe it'd fall

	<br/>Well guess what?  It was nothing at all
	<br/>Whitfield asked himself:
	<br/>"Why couldn't we talk about something important"
	<br/>But they talked about nothing at all

He's right, of course, but then we never get to hear records like that in my town. As it goes, neither Whitfield or Sarah ever lived in Birchfield Road, but I did, so I know what I'm talking about. Those upset by Sarah's gratuitous demise towards the end of this unpleasant little narrative will be relieved to learn that she re-appears, alive & well, albeit with a change of name, in the story An Idea Of Europe, gathering dust in a bookstore near you some time in the next ten years.

	<br/>So I lose all my bearings, can't find where I live,
	<br/>Now I'm standing at this door
	<br/>A being from another planet opens up the door
	<br/>And says: yeeeessss?
	<br/>Vhat You Vhant?
	<p />
	Now I refuse to believe it could possibly breathe
	<br/>The same atmosphere as me
	<br/>I try to be polite and say I made a mistake
	<br/>Bu the trouble is I'm shaking like a Christmas tree
	<br/>So here I am on the doorstep or somewhere or other
	<br/>I'm trying to communicate, I don't know why I bother
	<br/>The conversation's limited to say the very least
	<br/>It's always: yes?

	<br/>Here comes a voice that I'm learning to dread
	<br/>It's in my head!
	<br/>Vhat You Vhant?
	<br/>I wanna get out of here (questions and answers)

	<br/>You can dine with the devil
	<br/>But you'll find the wine he serves is far too sweet

	There's no point, you're almost gone
	<br/>'Coz the devil doesn't wait for tawdry last goodbyes
	<br/>And that's okay, they're stupid anyway
	<br/>My life was getting like a zoo
	<br/>Hundreds and thousands of half-mad people
	<br/>They're all dead already
	<br/>And the angels only look the other way
	<p />
	Go walk with the devil, yeah go where you please
	<br/>'Cause to walk with the devil comes free
	<br/>You can walk with the devil, you can walk on down the hall
	<br/>You can walk with the devil
	<br/>When you could have been walking with me
	<br/>You can walk with the devil, you can walk into another life
	<br/>Though I doubt you're gonna like the things you see
	<br/>You can walk with the devil
	<br/>Though for me it's much too much too late
	<br/>You can walk with the devil
	<br/>But you'll never ever walk again with me

	<br/>With just a helmet on his head and a tiny piece of board against the wind
	<br/>Lord, he drove that empty chassis like a man being hounded by his sins
	<p />
	And he was singing
	<br/>"I drive the roads that are closed by the Ancient Old Ones
	${anno_beg}
	Scarey H.P. Lovecraft monsters
	${anno_end}
	And I know the paths of the lonesome highway doomed.
	<br/>Shot my boss, killed his dog, left his children in the street

	<br/>When the doomed go shopping, boy, there ain't no stopping
	<br/>We're just happy to be here"

	The wolves were howling as he drove up to our side
	<br/>I felt a chill of terror, a fear I could not hide
	<br/>I smelled the diesel on his breath as he whispered right into my ear
	<br/>"Son, you'll never feel so doomed as when you ride the truck of fear
	<br/>Boy, you'll never feel so doomed as when you ride the truck of fear"
	<br/>We're headed for the rubber room upon the truck of fear

	<br/>I said that we all know that spirits can be dangerous.
	<br/>Meanwhile, the shadow of the snake climbs up the wall.
	<br/>Sometimes your English Language is not adequate at all...
	<br/>It's a shadow of a snake!  IT'S THE IMPENDING SNAKE!

They're never going to stop me from smoking or drinking my gin.<br/>

Where "beauty is freedom" and "freedom" is the prize.<br/>
They wouldn't know freedom if you salted it and rubbed it in their eyes.<br/>
Sense of entitlement three, common sense nil. Run and see your GP.<br/>
Whoa...living forever don't look so clever to me.

We were the hard water kids of the Asbestos Age - no one died.<br/>
Nobody chipped us or tracked us or caged us or taught us to fear. No one tried.<br/>
So we helped ourselves to the world unafraid.<br/>
Sometimes we even got paid.<br/>
Well, now I've spent all that money I earned,<br/>
But here is one thing I have learned:
<p />
There's nothing in life that's worth giving up<br/>
For the sake of five years in the Sunset Retirement Home.<br/>
Nothing in life is worth giving up<br/>
For a chair in a smoke-free dayroom watching telly,<br/>
Parched and immobile and praying for tea,<br/>
Patronised stupid, cake on your birthday...<br/>
Now tell me, my beauty: ain't it grand to be free?

Don't wonder.<br/>

	But here we are, screaming at the ambulance.<br/>
	That truck had my name on it.<br/>
<br/>
	I never felt as truly happy as I did with you.<br/>
	Took half a lifetime, worth every day!<br/>
	That view of the river, the gatehouse, the temple,<br/>
	The terraced row, the French chateau, the look that made me tremble.<br/>
	I had a dream: Enfudu misery.<br/>
	How could I know those broken creatures represented you and me!<br/>
	<br/>
	There we were: Museum Street on Halloween.<br/>
	There we were in stupid railway station bars.<br/>
	And here we are, where life becomes impossible.<br/>
	We want to be handled softly, kissed and told that we're worth something.<br/>
	<br/>
	Goodnight, Sweetheart.  Goodnight, Sweetheart.<br/>

	You see what I mean. Ah well. You and I know that the Taliban Jeep/New York
	stuff is about that time that the JBC got a taxi back from the Spin offices
	down Broadway to our secret Downtown Headquarters. The young taxi driver
	with the huge beard and the black turban kept plying us with questions about
	every aspect of Western celebrity stupidity from Michael Jackson to Lady Diana.
	<p />
	He couldn't say "musician" - he kept calling us "magicians". Later that
	day, I overheard Owen saying to somebody - "Oh yeah, we had a taxi ride
	with the Taliban this afternoon." Well, a couple of months later, when Bot
	and I saw the documentary on the BBC where the trendy young British twat
	"penetrated" Taliban-run Afghanistan with his secret camera, and we heard
	him saying repeatedly (and endearingly nervously) "Taliban Jeep", we thought
	of that New York experience and we thought of our backing track and so on...

	The satellites that circle us are witness to God's grace:
	<br/>He could pluck them from their orbits, cast them into Outer Space,
	<br/>But he lets them keep revolving as the Earth moves round the Sun,
	<br/>The only truly brilliant thing we've ever done.
	<p />
	Photographs of his creation - all the seas and land,
	<br/>Beamed to us from our space station help us understand.
	<br/>And the ladies in Los Angeles and the gentlemen in Perth
	<br/>See them up there, circling the Earth.
	<p />
	From Siberia to the Sun
	<br/>More than 90 million miles.
	<br/>Take the People's Train to the Academy of Science.
	<br/>Use the People's instruments, do the People's work:
	<br/>Put it up there, circling the Earth.
	<p />
	We all know the space heroes like Yuri Gargarin,
	<br/>But unknown thousands gave their lives to bring us this machine.
	<br/>Now everybody can see what their sacrifice was worth,
	<br/>Coz it's up there, and it's circling the Earth.
	<p />
	The satellites that circle us shine brightly as Big Stars,
	<br/>They can see the Memphis soul men driving in their Big Black Cars,
	<br/>And if you call them on the phone you might just hear the sound
	<br/>Of the satellites as they go round and round.
	<p />
	Hear your voice repeating when you're talking on the phone,
	<br/>Know that they are up there, know that we are not alone.
	<br/>And one day we'll all know what this life of ours is worth
	<br/>Coz they're up there, circling the Earth.
	<p />
	Circling the Earth (x3)
	<br/>For ever
	<br/>For ever
	<br/>Circling the Earth
	<br/>Encircling the Earth
	<br/>For ever.

	<br/>Came in from the North
	<br/>23 below
	<br/>Never mind the weather
	<br/>Never mind the snow
	<br/>We've a long long way to go.
	<br/>Kizzy, he went crazy
	<br/>Took a cab across town
	<br/>Walked up to O'Higgins
	<br/>Then he knocked him down
	<br/>East of the river Nile
	<br/>West of the Rockies
	<br/>In a swimming pool with Chuck and Flav
	<br/>"I've been to London, man.. on two world tours".
	<br/>We've been playing your records since we left New York
	<br/>From Queens to Compton
	<br/>East Coast! West Coast!
	<br/>Yours is the sound we dig the most
	<br/>Well, you and N.W.A.
	<br/>But you'd never ever know it to see us
	<br/>Floating [pastey/foreign] and uncomfortable above this piss-poor
	<br/>Midwest rock display
	<br/>Little bit of Wildlife
	<br/>Hey, hey
	<br/>
	<br/>Sing a song of Jen Jen
	<br/>She's got a human bone.
	<br/>And Nancy, she's driving far from home.
	<br/>[On a one-way/Conway] highway
	<br/>On a way to save your soul
	<br/>Listen Charlie, April, John, and Cole
	<br/>Harry was a panther
	<br/>Randy was a snake
	<br/>But back in Silver Lake
	<br/>It still felt a lot like home
	<br/>Every little while
	<br/>I'll find I'm lying there awake remembering
	<br/>[Good] people I have known
	<br/>They're all so far away
	<br/>[Oh, what would Deirdre/What would the sainted O'Donoghue] say?
	<br/>And how much do we [ever] really give away?
	<br/>[For a little wildlife]
	<br/>
	<br/>Coronado, Echo Park
	<br/>T.V. in the daytime, mayhem after dark
	<br/>Alvarado, McArthur Park
	<br/>Zombie shopping trolly people in the dark.
	<br/>Watts is burning
	<br/>Compton's burning
	<br/>Koreatown's burning and Brentwood's burning.

	<br/>Greg Shaw, O'Donaghue
	<br/>They can't be here
	<br/>Today with you.
	<br/>Alex Chilton, Nikki Sudden, too
	<br/>They can't be here
	<br/>Today with you.
