    Here it is at last!  The hep young sound of todays beat
    &eacute;lite, direct from the soul kitchen and served, still
    blazing, to your table!  The release of this, the Jazz
    Butchers first long play recording, comes after months of
    rumour and report of a hot new act with a cool new sound
    that leaves the others way way behind.  Now you too can hear
    for yourself the new groove that has set the bohemian set
    alight - in your own home!  Words alone cannot do justice to
    the cordon-bleu treats of the Butcher Beat - so roll back
    the carpet and swoop and dive with the fab Butcher Man!
    <p />
    <b>A Personal Message From The Jazz Butcher</b>:
    Well, it's sometime early in the big work ethic on a Friday
    morning and I'm hours away from the big bastard!  Looks like
    there's precious little time for me to chuck out that work
    ethic this weekend.  I've got to be a damned sight sterner
    than usual in the old quality control with the discipline
    that M.P.s pay high prices & favour for in those suburban
    bedrooms, if I'm to make it past the large sheet of paper
    with <b>NO MORE MONEY</b> writ large upon it.  Bus?  Train?
    - decisions, decisions!  Do we re-do the glockenspiels or
    echo the little so and soes out of all recognition - a sound
    you never heard before?  Which is The Voice to tell you
    about ${party}?  And will ${zombie} ever
    sound as good as The Zombies?  We're a long way from the
    truth yet poppets.  This is my first record all by myself.
    It's been a pleasure, which is good because that's what they
    should be isn't it?  It's been a worry to - still is - and
    loads more besides.... I'll let you know how we get on.
#define	albums[1]->patsez
	The one nobody ever talks about, even though a surprising
    number of you seem to have it.  Recorded for just &pound;300
    (Kevin Shields please take note...), it's really just the sound
    of a few mates failing to take seriously the fact they they've
    got an l.p. to make. ${gloop} and the unfinished ${engine} make me
    squirm a fair bit, but ${zombie}, ${gold}, and ${party} have all been
    good friends.
    <p />
    It seems VERY early eighties now, but you must remember that
    there was a LOT of crap for us to clear out of the way in those
    days.;;Pat Letter: 1993-08-30;;/letters/93Aug30/albums.html#bath;;1993-08-30

    This record collects together the various singles that
    have been issued in England to date under the much-abused
    name of the Jazz Butcher, to wit: me.
    <p />
    I rather like having them all in one place like this
    - it makes for a nice, noisey muck-it-up sort of disc
    that is ideal for leisure time at home, on the beach,
    in you local club.... hell, ANYWHERE!!!  Let me tell you about it.
    <p />
     ${smiff} and ${count} were recorded in the summer
    of 1983 in a place called Wellingborough, a small town in the
    middle of England where even the children are scarey!
    "Hey, mister, can you SEE in them glasses?"  I get to
    sing and play things like guitar, sax and piano.
    Max does the electric guitar.  On bass is Rolo McGinty,
    and Princess Alice Thompson plays the organ.  They're both in
    the ${tops} now, a group internationally recognised as
    being the shortest collection of pop musicians in the
    world.  Playing the drums is Kevin Haskins, a charming
    neighbour of mine, and veteran of the ${haus} conspiracy.  Miaowula!
    <p />
     ${marn} and  ${zombie}
    were the hot spots from my second single,
    recorded in London one Sunday afternoon in January 1984.
    ${marn} is an attempt to force a meeting between the
    steaming tropical jungles of Bangladesh (where the tigers
    live) and the frozen stepps of Siberia (where the Siberian
    tigers live).  ${zombie} is just sick. Max and Rolo and
    me again, with Jody Palmer on drums, bongoes and "Oi'm jest
    a rual boy on a day out in London, guvnor".
    <p />
    ${road} features me, Max, David J.  on bass, and Mr Jones
    on drums, and was recorded in Wellingborough again in
    April '84.  The song is by ${richman}, but the sentiments
    are entirely our own. The "Twilight Zone Mix" on this
    record concerns Max's inability to get from one place
    to another without disappearing for long periods.  You've
    heard of the Bermuda Triangle?  Well, Max has shares
    in it.  <a name="rain"> ${rain}, recorded at the same session,
    concerns sex and the weather and the undoubted connection
    between the two.  Incidentally, it didn't rain once during
    the three days we were in the studio!
    <p />
     ${men} and ${jbpm} see the Jazz Butcher Group (me and
    Max and Dave and Jones) in vaguely political mood.  In
    other words, feisty.  Real Men, the kind who never sit
    together on buses in case they get their medallions tangled.
    The Prime Minister, a book-burning lunatic, under whose
    "leadership" the U.K. has become a police-state satellite
    of the most evil and morally corrupt regime in the world.
    Locked in the basement in Leamington Spa in steamy August
    '84, The Jazz Butcher Group reaches for the cheese wire!
    Gasp at the awesome sound of a guitar massacre in Parliament!
    <p />
    Lastly, from the same summer sessions, comes ${h2o} Max
    and I, late at night, contemplating the curious tale
    of the talking elephants, and the endless search for
   supplies of free drink...

    Damn good idea these retrospective re-releases; teach the
    bawling brats a thing or two about <b>real</b> music.
    Damn, <b>damn</b> good idea in fact.
    <p />
    The Jazz Butcher you say?  Yes, of course I remember them,
    and mostly fond memories they are too.  It was this very
    song with its analysis of Adam Faith as Marxist
    revolutionary that broke the mould and them internationally.
    Whilst I was roving (as any good reporter must) it was my
    good fortune to witness this band on the rise, and I learnt
    many things.
    <p />
    The Jazz Butcher boys were born when Elvis Presley joined
    the army; make of those two facts what you will.
    <p />
    After fraught and frugal years as an eager youth hatful of
    songs this very record, only three million times better than
    the third Frankie single (an old Queen cast off), signalled
    a change in peculiarities and the nation's desire to redeem
    its soild past.  The Jazz Butcher was on everybody's lips.
    Herpes spread like wildfire.
    <p />
    They met and charmed everyone, even in 'Hi' society where
    they would be forced to tell what Boy George was really like
    (yes he bathed every day and yes he washed his hands before
    meals) and why pop music no longer meant Doris Day.  Another
    cigar Gertrude?
    <p />
    They wore way out of gear but never fell in love with
    Russian spies.  They sang of fish (gills will be gills) and
    most importantly, kept Hazel O'Connor locked in a cellar ten
    feet down.
    <p />
    They were pop pirates in the greatest of British traditions.
	  'Hello there, nightowls, they would say but when the pop
    concert ended and the disco resumed life was found to be
    wanting.  The police kept telling the kids to move on.
    Trouble was brewing; some took umbrage, others 'pep' pills
    whilst some took simply outrageous liberties, controversy
    fuelling chart success.  Who can forget their third album,
    'Doctor Chumley Repents' and the questions asked in the
    house?  A battalion of TV screens were kicked in.  Things
    had to stop.
    <p />
    Finally they went too far, waving their winkles at Her
    Majesty's Government.  Immediately, and quite
    domocratically, their royalties were sequestered.
    <p />
    Never before in the field of human conflict has so much been
    owed by so many to so few.
    <p />
    The debts linger on, every bit as much as their mass suicide
    in Trafalgar Square.  <b>Real</b> men.
    <p />
    ${mercer}
    <p />
    Claudi Bidi writes "what a load of codswallop!  It was my
    great fortune to be intimately acquainted with the Jazz
    Butcher and I know for a fact that during those last
    desparate years he fell in love with Russian Spies all the
    time."

   A Sri Lankan gentleman once sat down beside me in a bar
    in Bremen, asked me to sign his copy of this record,
    and then, even as I wrote messages of good luck and global
    harmony, announced sternly "This is a very...bad record."
    He was a berk, but he had a point.  Alan McGee and a number
    of people in France, America and The Music Business have
    called this one a "classic album".  People do, of course,
    say much the same about "Dark Side Of The Moon".  Can
    you hear my flesh creeping?  Germans, on the other hand,
    despise it almost universally.
    <p />
    We were deeply confused young men when we made this record.
    Max, Jones and I had all been drinking dangerously for
    over a year now, and the poor bass player who replaced
    David was finding it almost impossible to keep up with
    our twisted thought patterns.  Do you like my bass playing?
    That's me on ${shame}, ${sa} and a couple of others.
    <p />
    By now, effectively, Max and I had totally lost any sense
    of quality control on my writing.  Tragic and sincere
    or glib and ludicrous, we recorded EVERYTHING.  Sent
    in to make demos for this l.p.  Max and I came out with
    ${conspir} where we squandered a couple of great ideas that
    this l.p. so badly needs.  ${rivers} you'll notice, has
    bought a new reverb unit, a Lexicon, in fact.  He's also
    taken to recording digitally.  The ensuing absurd gloss,
    matched with an absence of native intelligence around
    the bottom end, gives a lot of the songs a sound that
    I dislike.  ON THE OTHER HAND, there's ${angels}, ${fall}, ${world}.
    <p />
    Still, in 1986 the best plan would be to buy the
    <a href="angels.html">12" single</a> and go see the band
    in concert.  Generally, we had it down in concert.  In
    just about every other department, however, we were coming
    to bits, individually and collectively, and to me this
    record actually shows the morbid state of things at the
    time.  Not, of course, that we really noticed any of
    this until months later, when, confronted by the realitied
    of having been on an accidental two-year intercontinental
    binge, we retired damaged, leaving the group in pieces.
    Oh, and another thing about <b>Gentlefolk</b>... it's
    pretentious too.

	The Jazz Butcher and his group are not in the business of belonging; they are too old and too obstreperous to conform to some attention-seeking image or commercially viable formula. Rather, they bring their not inconsiderable talents to bear on whatever happens to be in the way at the time. The results can only be described as essential.
#define	albums[16]->line
    The Jazz Butcher first appeared in Bohemian London in 1983,
    clutching a battered acoustic guitar called Lenin and
    looking for a place to stay.  His origins remain unclear to
    this day.  Some say that he swam to safety from the wreck of
    doomed Liberian supertanker Gonzolo; others that he had been
    planted by Speznaz to subject the English legal profession.
    The most credible theory is that he had formerly been hiding
    out in darkest rural Northamptonshire.. plotting.  What was
    in his mind is only too blatantly set forth within the
    grooves of this disc: A semi-literate pub-crawl through the
    swamp of rock's rich tapestry, laced with self-destructive
    recreational pursuits and maddened by the buzzing of a
    thousand punk rock guitars.
    Not that the sound of the Jazz Butcher and his Sikkorskis
    from hell (for it is they that are likely to relate to your
    scrambled transatlantic notions of what constitutes Le
    Pernk).  Press him on the subject and he will sputter
    through the special brew, "of course we're a punk group -
    because we do what we want to do" fair.  As they say,
    enough.  To me, though, the Butcher's axe grinds somewhere
    along the non-existent fusion between soul music and the
    sort of dirty pop that failed to make the ${vu}
    famous.  Not that this would take into
    account the skiffy suicide that constitutes ${reagan},
    or the bittersweet cushioning
    that cradels the decidedly neurotic ${sat}.
    And Max Eider's ${drink} (dedicated to his hobby) is
    another sack of potatoes altogether.  The Jazz Butcher and
    his group are not in the business of belonging; they are too
    old and too obstreperous to conform to some
    attention-seeking image or commercially viable formula.
    Rather, they bring their not inconsiderable talents to bear
    on whatever happens to be in the way at the time.  The
    results can only be described as essential.

    Having ended up on ${creat}, which I took as a bit of
    a validation, I was keen to get as far away from all
    those "w" words that had followed my group around, and
    to make it as clear as I could that this was a rock &
    roll thing, not some "eccentricity". I had my shades
    and I had my fringed suede jacket and I had the
    ${weather} rhythm section.
    <p />
    In the last flickering days before Marriage and Acid
    House would change the world Kizzy and I hung out in
    his dealer's flat in Islington and WALKED to the studio
    in Waterloo everyday.  The sessions were chaotic and
    funny.  At one stage Kizzy arrived 56 hours late for
    a mix, having been held by the Police under the Prevention
    of Terrorism Act.
    <p />
    <a href="${jbc_people}/david_whittemore.html">David</a> has
    this down right as a sort of self-justificatory thing.
    What disappoints me is that it came out sounding so SMOOTH
    and tidy.  I'd hoped it would be more harsh and mad.
    I guess perhaps it's the saxes, which, I recall, enraged
    some reviewers.  ${sonic} does good things on ${sue} (that's
    4 of them big ballads at least, now), that was more the
    idea.  Still, not to slag O'Higgins, who began a lengthy
    association with the JBC on this recording.
    <p />
    This sold rather well, which was pleasing, and seems
    widely liked.  I can't fuck with that, but I had hoped
    that it would be more a "change of direction" than it
    was.  But I like <b>Fishcotheque</b>;
    I wish there more records as good as it.

    This was a real "band" album by a touring unit which
    had become really quite ferocious.  In choosing to work
    with ${rivers} again we felt that we were sufficiently
    noisy and fierce to cope with any over- tidy production
    strokes he might pull.  "Clean *that* up, then, ya bastard"
    was out declared policy in the group.
    <p />
    Of course, we under-rated him.I wanted to start to mess
    with the pretty traditional song structures we were using.
    We were all aware that music was changing, and, more
    out of interest than out of any spurious "career" concern,
    we wanted to see where we could take our pop songs using
    things like breakdowns, the mixing in of "found" voices
    (which we first heard NOT from Steinski or the Bryne/${eno}
    collaboration, but from John Stapleton, a DJ who scratched
	  things in at early ${aero}, radical and unexpected changes
    of sounds - a series of sonic events rather than plain
    old verse/chorus structure.  I probably did too much
    pre-production on my (new) 4-track at home, and the whole
    thing sounds a bit stillborn.

    "<b>Basement</b>"; the word
    smacks of oily concrete parking lots, hotel elevators and
    bulky, bovine [spongiform] laundry baskets.  The
    Basement; as far down as we go.
    <p />
    It oughtn't, by rights, to have had a garden.  Oh, the
    initial impression was just right!  Seedy London
    frontage; scrawled cardboard messages by the bell; a
    dark, intricate descent through too many doors, perfect
    underground T.V. squalor, beyond the mysteries of Edgar
    Wallace late at night in black and white and what's that
    sudden pain in the small of my back?
    <p />
    Once through that final door, things would take an
    unexpected turn.  I'm entering the chamber now.  Whoa!
    The jackal-headed dead!  Excellent!  Music and dancing
    and improbable combinations of Czech beer and
    Jalape&ntilde;os!  Doors flung open to an ivied yard where
    the randomly seditious lounge on cushions and hoot at the
    stars and that singular man next door.  Sometimes friends
    of friends would come by and take it for a nightclub.
    But it wasn't a nightclub, it was a basement.
    <p />
    The big red bedford mobile nation state rolls on, and,
    rolling, cannot stop.  Miles in darkness to the appointed
    spot, deep wold evil dead killers wind shelter: beans,
    bitburger and no such thing as noise reduction.  Mules in
    the night, mantor and eggulos tremble at the head of the
    board, waiting for the great infector to make with the
    knife.  Stray Americans, stray steg, nice.
    <p />
    Dank!  teeth and hair fall out.  Fingernails keep
    growing.  The pump is out, the night is dark, we're
	waiting for Mary.  Don't go out to the beer shack.  Those
    jackal-headed dead could be on the lurk.  Voluptuously of
    course, it looked like a farmhouse.  But it wasn't a

    Well, if things seemed weird back in February 1989, by
    January 1990, when we made this baby, the Weird were
    going shopping on bikes.  With Kizzy sick and unable
    to tour, ${richard} had joined and, during a long
    US/Canadian tour has turned us all on to Can and a lot
    of other weird things.

    In a farmhouse in the dead of winter, in personal circumstances
    too bizarre and complex to relate, we set about making
    our "commercial suicide" album.  When we delivered it
    to ${creat} they did their nuts and said it was the best
    thing we'd done in years. It took me a while to figure
    it out, but then I agreed with them.

    Well, I couldn't have written it any other way, and I
    love that everyone plays on it, so I'm not in much of
    a position to know why you don't care for it. All I can
    say is that I'm still well pleased with it as a recording,
    and as a piece of writing about a tough subject. I mean,
    <b>I</b> hate "divorce rock" too.  It wuz a tough assignment.
    <p />
    Go on, give the fucker another listen.  The songs may
    not make you laugh, but the playing ought to give you
    a few thrills. And, after all, I'm not in a band to make
    money, or be a "professional entertainer" - I'm in a band
    because I like to play very loud electric guitar.  This
    IS the sound of me having fun, and getting me to do that
    in those dark days of mid-1991 was no small job.  (Can
    anyone tell me how I *knew* that the French were going
    to like "${girls}"?);;Pat Letter: 1993-08-30;;/letters/93Aug30/albums.html#blue;;1993-08-30$$

	<b>From The Sports Desk</b>
	<hr />
	Those who saw the Jazz Butcher's earliest performances
	might well be forgiven for entertaining the notion that
	here were farcial drunks with no drummer, best euphemised
	as 'eccentric' and kept at a distance.  As the highly
	excitable Butcher and dapper, unflappable guitarist
	${max} careered from one ill-advised engagement to the
	next with a constantly changing band of friends, they
	delivered a series of wildly erratic shows driven by
	blind faith and the systematic abuse of cheap liquor. It
	was hard to tell if these people were for real.  They
	would roll up in an open-top Triumph Vitesse with bits of
	drum kit sticking out the back.  Sometimes the Butcher
	would ride the tube to shows, wearing his sailor hat and
	carrying his guitar in a cardboard box with a huge
	drawing of E.T. on it.  Of course, it was the only way
	they knew how.
	<p />
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Jan27.html">In January 1984</a>,
	Max & The Butcher were engaged to appear at a London
	Polytechnic.  The ensuing debacle, fuelled by Carlsburg
	Special Brew, saw them both walk offstage at different
	times, and climaxed with their shadowy friend, The
	Antchrist, shouting pointlessly from a step ladder.  Word
	is that they found Mister Jones, the drummer, the
	following day.  Soon after, ${sm} joined in to play bass
	and a band existed.
	<p />
	Glass Records supremo David E. Barker had built up some
	curiosity around the Butcher's deceptively professional
	early singles, and the group now found themselves playing
	to people who wanted to see them.  Some were disaffected
	goths, many were Japanese, one of them was ${dj},
	architect of <i>Bela Lugosi's Dead</i> and eagle-eyed pop
	detective.  Divid had been watching this nonsense for
	some time, and soon befriended all the musicians.  With a
	few dozen beers David signed up 'on loan' to play the
	bass, and made <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Apr21.html">his
	debut with the band</a> at Alan McGee's <b>Living Room</b>
	club in a tiny bar in North London.
	<p />
	That was the start of a busy year, from which many of the
	recordings on this collection come.  David and producer
	${rivers} taught the band a host of tricks, resulting in
	the first really professional Jazz Butcher L.P.,
	${scandal}.  The band also developed an agent and a van.
	David told the group about The Rider, and they saw that
	it was good.  In December the group climbed under a duvet
	on the floor of a Ford Transit and headed for their first
	European Dates.  They played two <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Dec8.html">magical</a>
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1984/Dec9.html">nights</a> in
	Hamburg that shaped the lives of many involved.  They
	drank gluehwein in a lakeside cafe on a Sunday afternoon.
	The Butcher, whose first reaction to being in Germany had
	been to hide under a table, had some kind of small
	epiphany.  They blew all the money in Amsterdam on the
	way home.
	<p />
	Over seven extremely wintry days in January 1985 the band
	completed another L.P.  ${mercer} (who pointed out that
	these boys were born the year that Elvis joined the army)
	had once prophesied that the Butcher's 3rd L.P. would be
	called 'Doctor Cholmondley Repents'.  But they were
	young, they were headstrong, they called it ${sex}.  It
	is the sound of a band at the peak of its creativity, and
	anyone who saw the group on the ensuing British dates
	would have a very different opinion to one who had
	watched the Butcher plummet from the stage of
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1983/Nov23.html">the Embassy
	back in 1983</a>.
	<p />
	Spring 1985 was time for David to go.  The man called
	${felix} arrived with his big Italian acoustic bass, and
	the endless touring began.  Between March
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/index.html">1985</a> and December
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/index.html">1986</a> the
	Jazz Butcher group played over 200 shows in 12 countries.
	They took to the life of the amplified itinerant with
	gusto, even surviving an early setback when the bus
	seized up in rural Sweden, forcing them to travel in a
	group with as much equipment as they could carry by train
	to the next date... <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1985/Mar31.html">in Zurich</a>.  They
	survived, but only just.  And Felix no longer believes
	that Switzerland is next door to Sweden.
	<p />
	The band took to Europe and vice-versa.  There were
	festivals in tents with people waving flags, lost
	weekends in Vienna, mad nights in dimly remembered
	nightclubs, and vodka everywhere.  There was chocolate
	cake all over Room 27.  '<i>In Europe</i>', beamed The
	Butcher, '<i>They treat you like a human being instead of
	a musician</i>'.
	<p />
	They still had their special nights.  A show in Sicily
	ended with the amplifiers on fire and the Butcher so
	drunk that he thought he'd got religion.  There was a
	first, brief foray into Spain that saw three of the group
	return physically wounded and drained of all bodily
	fluids.  As they leaned, croaking, on the Heathrow
	travolator, they were passed by a planeload of Japanese
	tourists, each one fresh as a daisy and keen to take a
	look at their first English person.
	<p />
	In the summer of 1986 the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, as
	they now called themselves, found themselves headlining
	at a <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Jul3.html">festival of
	Italian Communist Youth in Naples</a>.  After the show
	somebody asked the Butcher '<i>Where are you playing
	next?</i>' and he found himself having to reply
	'<i>New York City</i>'.  For Barker had been busy, and
	unbeknown to the group, <a
	href="${jbc_albums}/nonsense.html">a compilation of their
	work</a> was shooting up the American alternative charts.
	They arrived, bewildered, <a
	href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Jul17.html">in New York</a>, to find their
	album at Number 2, and muddled their way through the
	North American summer, playing at the top of their form,
	drinking out of brown paper bags, and striking terror
	into the Americans by wearing long trousers.
	<p />
	Felix left to court a lady in Montreal, and was replaced
	by ${lohan}, while ${green}, an associate of David J.,
	joined on saxophone.  ${dist} was released in October
	1986 and the five piece band that toured Britain and
	Europe in support made a mighty sound; but it was not to
	last.  <a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Nov27.html">On a
	particularly grim night in Switzerland</a> too much
	liquor, fatigue, stress and frustration drove Max and the
	Butcher to engage in a spectacular outbreak of
	dressing-room-fu, which resulted in Max receding from
	view on a train the following morn.  The remaining
	members finished the tour, the last show being in
	<a href="${jbc_gigs}/1986/Dec20.html">Zaragoza on 20th
	December 1986</a>
	<p />
	Mister Jones moved to Germany, where he found new fame
	gardening for Gunter Grass, playing for the Lost T-Shirts
	of Atlantis and for his own band, Shakespeare And The
	Bible.  ${max} released his solo L.P., ${best_kisser} in
	the summer of 1987, but was ill-served by his record
	company.  He can still be seen playing live in London and
	Hamburg.  ${dj} is in ${rocket} and Felix is a
	photographer.  The Butcher and Alex Green resurfaced
	about a year down the road on ${creat}.
	<p />
	In the years they recorded for Glass Records the JBC made
	four studio albums, <a href="${jbc_albums}/hamburg.html">a
	live L.P.</a> and eight singles, none of which have been
	available for almost ten years.  This collection offers
	some of the best moments from that period.  From the
	primitive early sound of ${foot} (where the Butcher plays
	drums) to the elaborate soundscapes of ${domest} and
	${angels} it charts the progress of a gang of friends who
	stumbled unprepared into a music scene of which they were
	often deeply suspicious, but which gave them more then
	they had ever imagined.  Here is music that won the
	admiration of figures as wildly diverse as Mark E. Smith,
	Tom Waits, REM, Andrew Eldritch, and Alan McGee.
	Heartfelt, thoughtless tunes of classic pop, high on
	hedonism and sharp of tongue: 'eccentric' perhaps by the
	meretricious standards of the times, but they've nearly
	all got drums.  Come a little closer, and enjoy.

	This disc is dedicated to the immortal memory of the great
    Peter Lorre.  You were one of the Big Ones, Peter.

    He comes down the platform and talks to you.  "Ever wondered
    what Max and I get up to away from the glamour of the modern
    stage?  No, probably not, but let me tell you that there is
    nothing we like better that to get our teeth into those Big
    Questions.  In celebration of which, we bring you this
    collection of tunes, recorded secretly in an obscure rural
    location, and positively busting with the authentic sound of
    disco dialectic."
    <p />
    He grinds out a cigarette on Platform 2 of Rugby Railway
    station and shugs: "You'll be all right".  Yours ever

		<p />
		The Jazz Butcher cover version is unavailable elsewhere. Interestingly
		enough, the same must be said about the other contributions ... The
		Rag Dolls were an early and short-living band of Dave Kusworth
		(Jacobites), <i>Missionary Boy</i> features Nikki Sudden
		himself on vocals
		(and is therefore better than the version that appears on <b>The
		Bible Belt</b> LP with Lizard on vocals) while Sad Go Round was The
		Swell Maps (!) in disguise. Obviously essential, this highly sought
		after split single came with a fanzine.

	It's not often that an artist gets to do a Bowie by consciously carving their personal epitaph into the grooves of their final LP. The Highest in the Land is that rarity of an album, and it could not have been made by a more brilliantly poetic and fearlessly sarcastic writer than Pat Fish, also known as The Jazz Butcher.

Starting in the early 2000’s a friend of mine, Andy Clarke, started recording a Christmas Album each year to give away to friends and clients. They started as a bit of a joke based around his fictional alta ego “Uncle Andy” best described as a lecherous, fraudster, man of the cloth. Over the next few years more and more musicians became involved not just from The New Barcelona but from around the world, some still jokey but more and more they became serious production numbers.
<p />
In 2007 the storyline for that years album was Uncle Andy’s huge charity gig, which at the end of he obviously stole all the takings. That year we finally asked Pat if he wanted to record one and he said he wouldn’t do a Christmas song, but he would record something … and oh did he do something special for us. He came round and recorded a beautiful version of Afterhours from the 3rd Velvet Underground album.
<p />
