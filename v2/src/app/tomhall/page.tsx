				His passing has deprived Northampton of its most unique and 
				life-affirming character, and one of the truly great original British artists of 
				the day. The fact that Tom was not a household name around the
				English-speaking world merely bears witness to 
				what a sad, grey place that world had already become. Without him here with us 
				now it&apos;s a whole lot worse.
				<p />
				You could say that Tom Hall was a part of the UK 
				folk scene. Yes, okay, he was the part of the UK folk scene that wrote The 
				Anglo-Saxon Gramophone, a tune so surreal in both words and music that it would 
				have been considered a landmark of English eccentricity (God help us!) if it had 
				emerged from the more widely publicised careers of Viv Stanshall or Kevin Ayers. 
				He was the part of the UK folk scene that recorded - with Alan Moore, of all 
				people - the chilling and entirely European &quot;Madame October&quot;, possibly 
				the most gory stamp collecting story ever told. He was the part of the UK folk 
				scene that recorded Blues For Jimmy Rogers, a lazy Louisiana sound that left one 
				Max Eider spluttering in disbelief at the elegance of it all.
				<p />
				Long before I ever moved to Northampton, Tom 
				toured the world with a pretty well-known folk aggregation called the Ratcliffe 
				Stout Band. His song John The Road tells the tale. I dare not even put it on. It 
				used to make me weep even when he was still around, probably drinking at The 
				Cricketers just around the corner from my house. I really don&apos;t know what the 
				little fucker would do to me tonight.
				<p />
				But it&apos;s just no good. You all know how I feel about English 
				folk music - down by the old muthafucking canal.
				To call Tom a folk artist is like calling Marcel Duchamp a 
				dauber.
				<p />
				Whether he played out with his full band, the Bareback Riders, 
				(&quot;all other bands can FUCK OFF!&quot; - <i>Me watching Tom at the 
				Blackbottom Club, Northampton 1995</i>) or whether he did one of his 
				extraordinary sit-down evenings with&nbsp; wunderkind fiddler Guy Fletcher, Tom 
				would always deliver a performance of utter unpredictability and, yes, danger. 
				This is <i>not</i> something that I associate with English folk music. The 
				Bareback Riders could follow him with telepathic ease in just the same 
				electrically fluid way that the original Patti Smith Group would chase their own 
				inspired leader. Tom would break off tunes to tell mad little stories, not 
				because the audience expected it, but quite simply because they had just 
				occurred to him. He could lead his band from a a straight three-chord anthem 
				into a mad neo-Celtic dreamspace at a moment&apos;s notice. Tom 
				was alive and real and inspiring and all over the place and too many people 
				smiled indulgently and took him for granted and they must be dead in their 
				stupid wee damn heads for it.
				<p />
				Tom recorded an album, &quot;Watering The Spirits&quot; in 
				1994 when he was already almost 50 years old. Alan Moore helped him to get it 
				done. Featuring the exemplary musical skills and sympathetic production of the 
				great Mark Griffiths, it is a gem of a record, certainly the finest ever to come 
				out of Northampton. You know, I don&apos;t even know where you can get a copy. 
				Doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t look for it, though. Even in this 21st Century Tom 
				and Guy were still hopping across the Atlantic to play, even getting themselves 
				on the radio, gigging in Nashville, Tennessee and up in the hills of West 
				Virginia.
				<p />
				Tom Hall also uttered the funniest single word that I have 
				ever heard. We were in Slurps Wino Bar one night. Tom was having a drink and 
				minding his own business. I was across the other side of the bar, trying to do 
				the same, despite finding myself in the midst of a pack of well-oiled and 
				increasingly vocal Australian types. Onstage was a young man, locally known as 
				&quot;Dead Justin&quot;, performing some ludicrous poem he had written. Justin 
				had an accompanying slide show. I think he reckoned he had some kind of William 
				Blake thing going on. Whatever, when the slide of the local public library went 
				on above his head, things started to spin out badly. Locals were guffawing at 
				<Image alt="Tom in ridiculous overalls"
					className="float-left p-5" src="https://v1.jazzbutcher.com/images/tom_hall.jpg" width={400} height={400} />
				the simple-minded earnestness of it all. The Australians were starting to riot 
				and say naughty things about the royal family. As the situation slid out of 
				control, there was some kind of technical breakdown on stage. Superb. Utter 
				chaos. People yelling, laughing, rioting...when a voice calls out, rich, fruity 
				and imperious.
				<p />
				It&apos;s Tom. and he&apos;s shouting: 
				<div className="bold">&quot;SECURITY!&quot;</div>
				<p />
				Tom Hall was a complete and utter original. I went to see him 
				sing and play every time that I could. Like every musician in Northampton I 
				looked up to him. It wasn&apos;t only his dangerously brightly coloured clothing that 
				intimidated me, but he showed nothing but kindness and support to me and all the 
				other younger musicians in town who were trying to make a go of what he had 
				already done, dusted and left behind.
				<p />
				I remember one Sunday morning during the making of {expand('ill')} when for some odd reason I was feeling unusually down and 
				battered. Arriving at the studio, I couldn&apos;t get in. Nobody was around and I 
				didn&apos;t really know where to put myself. As I milled about in the alley, without 
				a penny or a clue, Tom strolled past. &quot;Come and have a brandy, dear 
				boy!&quot;
				He was 50 years old, I was 38. Long before that autumn sunday 
				lunchtime I had happily drunk with Peter Buck, Mark E. Smith, Alan McGee, 
				Country Dick Montana and Tom Waits. One day in Waterloo in 1988 the &quot;great 
				train robber&quot; Buster Edwards had bought me a double brandy. Yet here in 
				this dangerous little Northampton lowlife bar with Tom, I felt like a little kid 
				getting a special glimpse into the grown-ups&apos; world. With his impeccable 
				old-world courtesy and genuine concern for a fellow musician he restored me like 
				the special genius spirit he truly was. Yes, yes, I know what I just wrote 
				there.
				<p />
				And yes, Tom liked a drink. And yes, that was probably what 
				did for him in the long run. I think that most likely everybody reading this 
				piece will know the score there. Tom was beautiful and damaged and deep and 
				unrepentant. And people have been earnestly telling me that Shane MacGowan was 
				close to death since 1984. Some of the best of us really are indestructible. The 
				fact that Tom&apos;s body has finally given out on his elegantly ferocious appetite 
				for life in no way means that he is - or ever will be - gone for those of us who 
				loved him.
				<p />
				Ride into the Sun, dear boy.
