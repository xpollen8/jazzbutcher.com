isn't it?\n\t<p>\n\tThey made us hang around for two or three days rehearsing for this show. We were supposed to do 2 numbers, this one and Big Saturday. For an eternity we\n\tmilled around in the Tyne Tees TV studio in Newcastle while the telly people piddled about with their telly nonsense. Occasionally we would be summoned at\n\tgreat haste (as though this was all somehow our fault) and given a quick run-through of our tunes for levels and so on. Whoever was mixing our shit was not to\n\tbe seen, but his voice would boom out of the monitors and boss us around in some way or other. We took to calling this person \"God.\" God seemed to appreciate\n\tthis and our brief rehearsals all went well enough.\n\t<p>\n\tDuring rehearsals I had one of the most humiliating experiences of my \"career\"...well, life, really. This was February 1986 and there was a Valentine's card that I\n\tneeded to send. During one of the endless lulls that we generally passed smoking bales of hashish (we seemed to have some particularly fine stuff with us on\n\tthis trip, though I can no longer recall whether or not we went out of our way to get Special Dope for The Telly), I strode out into Newcastle city centre. I\n\tfound myself entering an enormous edifice that I knew to be one of the largest shopping centres in Europe at the time.\n\t<p>\n\tI figured that a card shop would not be long in appearing but I was mistaken. I wandered deeper and deeper into this shopping mall, turning corners and\n\tgetting no closer to finding a stationers of any kind. In the back of my mind I had a vague recollection of Ariadne and Theseus in the Labyrinth and I was\n\tdoing my best to remember how I had come. I was deep in there, though, and deeper still before I found a place that would sell me a card, an envelope and a\n\tstamp.\n\t<p>\n\tOf course, on emerging from the card shop, my surroundings made no sense to me at all. By sheer luck I stumbled across some manner of back exit and made good\n\tmy escape from the massive mall. Of course, I had emerged in a spot far, far away from the place where I had entered. I had no clue as to where I was and all\n\tthat I could see, curving up the street, was the huge, monolithic outer wall of the shopping centre...as far as the eye could see!\n\t<p>\n\tI was lost and I had to admit it. I was going to have to speak to a native. I had no great confidence that I would even understand any directions that I might\n\tbe given in the local dialect. It all sounded like animal innards sluicing down a dreadful drain in a cold and stinky place to me. For that matter, as I stood\n\tthere bewildered in the afternoon sun with my stupid hair and clothes, I had no great confidence that the natives would do anything other than batter me\n\trelentlessly until I resembled a fairly lumpy bowl of beetroot soup.\n\t<p>\n\tEventually a native hove into view. To my delight, it was a fairly ordinary-looking middle-aged lady, probably out to do her shopping. I approached her\n\tconfidently for directions. And then, just before I addressed her, it hit me, the absurdity of what I was now going to have to say to her. With my mind\n\toverbrimming with mortification and self-disgust, I found myself saying to this perfectly nice Northern lady: \"Excuse me, dear. Could you possibly tell me the\n\tway to the television studios?\"\n\t<p>\n\tYou can't hang around a tv studio for very long without witnessing a couple of moments that make you question your will to live. An early warning came at\n\tabout four o'clock on the first afternoon. Over on the other stage stood the songwriting genius Stephen Duffy, still wearing his raincoat, with his electric\n\tguitar hanging limp and untouched around his waist. He had recently had a bit of a hit with some piece of pop fluff that he had written and you could now see\n\tthe terrible, terrible regret on his face as he stood motionless among his gnarled and yet oddly faceless record-company \"pro\" band members as they bashed out\n\ta useless, chillingly efficient Aryan 12 bar blues around him.\n\t<p>\n\tA couple of days later I was milling around the arse end of the studio, killing some time, when I saw a big old white Rolls-Royce come rolling into the\n\tdelivery bay. Standing back a little to stay inconspicuous, I waited to see which big old pop star would emerge from the vehicle. One by one the members of\n\tSigue Sigue Sputnik stepped out on their ridiculous stack heels. Once they were all out of the motor, though, they didn't really seem to know what to do next.\n\tI was puzzled. Then somebody came up to them and spoke a few words. All the members of the band got back into the Roller, which then reversed back up the\n\tloading bay. Then it came back down again. And the band all got out again.\n\t<p>\n\tThat's when I realised. They were rehearsing getting out of a car.\n\t<p>\n\tWe were bored as arseholes for most of the time. It's just as well that we had all that quality hash because, back at our cheap but rather nice suburban\n\thotel, we were drinking like cunts and there was a definite edge in the air. There was a lot of paranoia about our distributors at the time and one night, sat\n\tat the bar, Eider, Jonesy and I started laying into Dave Barker something proper. \"Where's the fucking money?\" would probably just about have summed up the\n\tgist of our fifteen minute tirade. Dave, as pissed as we were, rode it out incredibly gracefully, though, of course, at the time we just took it for\n\tbloody-minded recalcitrance. Eventually we wore ourselves out with the griping. There was a brief silence. All three musicians were somehow hoping that, now\n\tthat we had done enough shouting, The Truth would be unveiled. As I say, were pissed as cunts.\n\t<p>\n\tSilence. Slitty-eyed anticipation. And then D. Elvis Barker turns to me and he says:\n\t\"Pat...I love the USA.\"\n\t<p>\n\tThis was February 1986.\n\t<p>\n\tWell, as I say, we hung around Newcastle for two or three days to play six minutes of live music. When we turned up \"on the day\" we were told that we would,\n\tin fact, only be playing one number. Paula Yates was back from the far east with news of Madonna's new movie or something, so the live bands had to be cut to\n\tallow this important cultural bombshell to be aired. (Paula Yates, it transpired, was actually a lot nicer and less up-herself than Jooles Holland.)\n\t<p>\n\tSo, here we are. Three days to prepare to do three minutes of music on the fucking telly. Mitch Jenkins showed up with some even better quality hash and, in\n\tour tiny, windowless dressing room, we fell upon it like fiends. You could not see in that little room.\n\t<p>\n\tAnd yet...and yet...and yet...As soon as we get up there on the flapping stage we start playing as though we have an urgrent appointment somewhere else!\n\t<p>\n\tI particularly like Owen's desperate attempts to sing and smile at the same time (we had been discussing this a lot and he doubtless thought he was being well\n\tironic, not realising that camera just ended up making him look like a psycho!) Jooles appeared to take the ending of the tune as some kind of personal\n\taffront. Given that we'd been doing that on and off for the past three days, you might have thought that The Great Musician might have figured out that this\n\twas just the way that the tune ended.\n\t<p>\n\tWe were in the pub before it was dark."},{"gigtext_id":36,"datetime":"1986-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":"recording","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00

A large posse of our Hamburger \n\t\t\tfriends were there, edging around the Great Clemens Kinder, who had set up a \n\t\t\tfull-on mobile studio in there in between the sandwiches and the beer.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>After the room filled up I was forced by the Hamburg Police to \n\t\t\tintroduce our one-man <I>Vorgruppe</I>, Curtis E. Johnson. I did my best to be \n\t\t\tencouraging and friendly, but I guess it all went a bit Robbie Williams. As I \n\t\t\tstepped back into the dressing room, leaving Curt to his fate, Max appeared and \n\t\t\tdeclared in warm, congratulatory tones,\n\t\t\t<p>\"That was truly ... nauseating.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>Shortly afterwards Nikki took me aside, urgently pleading:\n\t\t\t<p>\"When I come on to do my tune ... <I>please</I> \n\t\t\tdon't introduce me!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>Curtis went straight at the crowd, and although he later \n\t\t\tconfessed to feeling nervous, he won them over with the first two or three \n\t\t\tsongs. As he began to play Dougie MacClean's \"Caledonia\", Max, \n\t\t\tOwen and I found ourselves alone in the dressing room. Each of us sat in a \n\t\t\tchair, listening intently to this incredible tune. As we sat there, filling up, \n\t\t\tthe door opened and a friend of a friend stood there. He came in, looked around, \n\t\t\thung up his coat, then left. Nobody said a word the whole time. I caught up with \n\t\t\thim later and said \"You must think we're very strange people.\" \n\t\t\tBut it was the tune. When you hear Curtis sing it, you'll want to stop for \n\t\t\ta second too. It's a travelling song, but it's about memories and \n\t\t\thome and love, too. He couldn't have played a sweeter version for three \n\t\t\told boys with a history, sitting in the place that they all associate with all \n\t\t\tthat magic stuff possibly more than any other. The moment would have made the \n\t\t\twhole trip worthwhile for me if it had all stopped there.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>But <I>did </I>it all stop there, Churchill?\n\t\t\t<p>\"Oh NO.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>For his last tune Curtis was going to do \"Hoochie Coochie \n\t\t\tMan\", and he had invited Pat to play harp with him on that tune. Pat spent \n\t\t\tmost of the tune standing on stage looking for the appropriate harp before \n\t\t\trealising that he simply didn't have that one on board and leaving again. \n\t\t\tCurt collapsed laughing and promptly buggered the connection on his guitar. He \n\t\t\tmade a graceful exit, sliding down those last four bluesy chords acoustic and \n\t\t\tleaving the stage to great applause.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>After a few minutes of mindless fun with the stage curtains, Max \n\t\t\tand I found ourselves on stage. For the first part of our set we were alone on \n\t\t\tthe stage, playing as a duo. One by one our pals would come out and join us to \n\t\t\thelp out on a particular tune. We had done the usual sort of shit with candles, \n\t\t\tbut we had also brought with us our secret weapon:\n\t\t\t<p>The Executaire.\n\t\t\t<p>As each musician joined us on stage we would greet him and pour \n\t\t\thim a glass of his favourite spirit from The Executaire, a 1950s style travel \n\t\t\tbar which was kindly donated to the cause by Bigrig Industries of San Francisco \n\t\t\tin 1997, and which we had filled for a stupidly low price with German Brandy, \n\t\t\tRussian Vodka and Mexican Tequila.\n\t\t\t<p>Apparently, a lot of the audience thought at first that we \n\t\t\tcalled Pat \"The Executaire\" (and it is only fair to point out that he \n\t\t\tis a bit of a natty dresser), but as more and more folks came on and had a drink \n\t\t\tthey began to see what was going on.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>Here is the set that we played.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>Partytime\n\t\t\t<br/>Whaddya?\n\t\t\t<br/>What's the Matter, Boy?\n\t\t\t<br/>Raking Up Leaves (Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Soul Happy Hour (Owen on triangle and vocals)\n\t\t\t<br/>It has to be You (Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Just Like Betty Page\n\t\t\t<br/>Angels\n\t\t\t<br/>Girls Who Keep Goldfish (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Nikki \n\t\t\tand Max on electric guitars, me on acoustic guitar)\n\t\t\t<br/>DRINK (Owen on drums vocals and kazoo, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Baby, It's You (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Curtis on \n\t\t\tbongos)\n\t\t\t<br/>The New World (Owen on snare drum, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Old Snakey (Owen on snare, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>The Human Jungle (Owen on bongos and vocals, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Who Loves You Now?

We'd had a great time and made ourselves a little \n\t\t\tmoney. The show had a really warm vibe. At times it felt like we were getting \n\t\t\taway with murder, but at the same time we sort of knew that what we were doing \n\t\t\twas all right. My favourite moment came in \"Goldfish\" where it turned \n\t\t\tout that Max and Nikki had a plan : they both played the guitar solo \n\t\t\tsimultaneously! I sat there strumming on my acoustic laughing my head off. To \n\t\t\tthink that some unlucky bastards can't even find one good guitarist. Some \n\t\t\tguys have all the luck. In Hamburg anyway.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>We spent the subsequent weekend having all kinds of twisted fun. \n\t\t\tCurtis gatecrashed a blues night in a pub, met (and got autographed by) \n\t\t\tHamburg's most celebrated hooker, ran away from a predatory circus owner, \n\t\t\tlost his crabs in the fish market at dawn and never went to bed ever. The rest \n\t\t\tof us prowled from The Onion to the Bar Zentrale, stopping in at a bar that \n\t\t\tsomebody had named after Max where we played table football and drank nameless \n\t\t\tshorts of various colours. As Max said, even in Hamburg terms we had an extreme \n\t\t\ttime.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>By Monday night we were all back home, older if not wiser, and \n\t\t\tlooking forward to the showdown with Martin Stephenson at the Racehorse in \n\t\t\tNorthampton on Friday.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>Viva La Executaire!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<p>&copy; Pat Fish 1999"},{"gigtext_id":339,"datetime":"1999-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"I'm in recovery.\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tThe Brothers were in town last night, playing a show.

Schneck</P>\n\t\t\t<P>I got to see this show because of a vision\n\t\t\t I had.  I know that sounds mad, but I can't think of a better\n\t\t\t word.   During my lunch hour, one day in late August, I was walking\n\t\t\t to Chinatown in Boston, listening to the Jazz Butcher song \"Rosemary\n\t\t\t Davis World of Sound\" on my headphones.  I suddenly had\n\t\t\t an image in my head of being in New York with my friend Jerry\n\t\t\t and Pat Fish (a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher).  When I got back to work,\n\t\t\t I looked up the Jazz Butcher web site and saw that he was playing\n\t\t\t several shows in the US, including one in New York City.  I told\n\t\t\t Jerry and he got us tickets for the show.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>I'm not going to attempt to give a full history\n\t\t\t of the Jazz Butcher; there's a wonderful web site (actually,\n\t\t\t it's pretty much the only worthwhile thing I've seen in my limited\n\t\t\t use of the Internet) at jazzbutcher.com.\n\t\t\t  He's been around since the\n\t\t\t early eighties, but stopped playing as the Jazz Butcher a few\n\t\t\t years ago; currently he's not on a label and nearly all of his\n\t\t\t records are out of print.  His music ranges from silly drinking\n\t\t\t songs to social commentary to gorgeous romantic guitar numbers\n\t\t\t - guess which ones are my favorites!  He doesn't play in the\n\t\t\t US very often, and I really never expected to get to see him\n\t\t\t play.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>We got to the club around the time it was\n\t\t\t supposed to open, and of course it didn't open on time.  I could\n\t\t\t hear the tantalizing sounds of the Jazz Butcher's sound check\n\t\t\t coming through the metal curtains covering the entrance; I recognized\n\t\t\t \"Mr. Odd.\"  Wetlands, on Hudson Street, has the appearance\n\t\t\t of an abandoned warehouse, but Jerry had bought the tickets there\n\t\t\t so we knew we were in the right place.  We positioned ourselves\n\t\t\t on the ramp near the entrance and amused ourselves people-watching\n\t\t\t and singing \"All Tomorrow's Parties.\"  Quite a few\n\t\t\t cute people in the crowd.  Eventually they opened the curtains\n\t\t\t and turned on the lights and made us line up and wait some more.\n\t\t\t  As we were waiting, a tall, gaunt man in a suit came over the\n\t\t\t chains at the opposite side of the entrance and went into the\n\t\t\t club.  Jerry said something about him looking like he was dead.\n\t\t\t  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Finally they started letting us in.  The club\n\t\t\t was small but well laid out.  To my right as I entered were the\n\t\t\t stairs to the bathrooms downstairs and a DJ booth made out of\n\t\t\t a wrecked van; to the left were steps up to the bar.  Further\n\t\t\t back, the stage was against the right wall, with a dressing room\n\t\t\t area in the back right corner and seating along the left wall.\n\t\t\t  Jerry and Sophie got places in the back left corner and then\n\t\t\t Jerry and I went to the bar.  While he was buying drinks, I noticed\n\t\t\t the tall, gaunt man we had seen before.  He was signing autographs.\n\t\t\t  It was Max Eider, the guitarist.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>I couldn't sit still, so I found what I hoped\n\t\t\t was a good spot near the right-hand corner of the stage, and\n\t\t\t stood against a pillar drinking my beer.  I happened to look\n\t\t\t over my right shoulder and saw Pat Fish.  I felt my face light\n\t\t\t up in a big grin, and he smiled at me.  At that point, I didn't\n\t\t\t care what the rest of the evening was like.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>There was a long wait before the opening band\n\t\t\t played.  They had the unfortunate name Asseaters U.K.  Their\n\t\t\t singer seemed drunk and embarrassed, but they didn't play very\n\t\t\t long.  Someone said that the last song that they did was a Mekons\n\t\t\t song, but it wasn't one that I knew.  Immediately after they\n\t\t\t left the stage, a red-haired woman in jeans and a short-haired\n\t\t\t guy in a red t-shirt began setting up effects boxes and other\n\t\t\t equipment.  The club was quite full and I was glad that I had\n\t\t\t claimed my spot early.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Finally, Max Eider and Pat Fish came onstage,\n\t\t\t to tremendous applause.  Someone helped Max over to a stool,\n\t\t\t right in front of where I was standing.  Pat was a little to\n\t\t\t the left.  I had a great view, except that the stage lights weren't\n\t\t\t on.  Pat said, \"I'm comfortable with my sexuality, could\n\t\t\t we have some light up here?\"  He talked about how he just\n\t\t\t found out that Wetlands donates any profits they make to environmental\n\t\t\t causes, and said, \"What a good room to be in!\"  They\n\t\t\t started the show with \"Partytime.\"  As Pat sang, \"I\n\t\t\t could look at all the girls that are in this room,\" he looked\n\t\t\t around at all the girls in the front row.  He was extremely attractive,\n\t\t\t although not conventionally handsome.  Dark hair, dark eyes,\n\t\t\t great eyebrows, several teeth out - very British.  He wore a\n\t\t\t dark blue suit over a grey cotton knit shirt with buttons at\n\t\t\t the neck, and soft-looking black leather shoes.  Max was wearing\n\t\t\t a suit and black Doc Martens.  Max was playing a hollow-bodied\n\t\t\t electric guitar, Pat a solid-bodied one with a sticker of a head\n\t\t\t of a cat wearing a rhinestone collar and winking its left eye.\n\t\t\t  Several times during the first part of the set he made comments\n\t\t\t about them playing \"pussy music.\"  He also told the\n\t\t\t audience \"Relax, we're going to be up here for hours,\"\n\t\t\t and referred to the show as the last Jazz Butcher show of the\n\t\t\t century (Wetlands billed it as the last ever.)  After \"Partytime\"\n\t\t\t came \"Too Much Falling In Love,\" then Max Eider sang\n\t\t\t his song, \"Raking Up the Leaves.\"  He seemed horribly\n\t\t\t nervous or something, but his singing and playing were gorgeous.\n\t\t\t  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>They were then joined by Owen Jones, who with\n\t\t\t Pat and Max played on the earliest Jazz Butcher recordings, through\n\t\t\t 1986's <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>.  He was dressed more casually\n\t\t\t than the others, wearing a striped knit shirt, and had sandy\n\t\t\t brown hair.  Pat thanked someone at the club for lending them\n\t\t\t the accordion which Owen Jones was about to play, and said that\n\t\t\t theirs had gotten smashed by United Airlines - \"Boo United\n\t\t\t Airlines!\"  He urged everyone to fly Delta.  He then introduced\n\t\t\t \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish\" as a song about small gold\n\t\t\t fish.  The previous weekend I had bought a pair of costume-jewelry\n\t\t\t earrings for fifty cents from an eccentric old lady at a yard\n\t\t\t sale; they were strings of gold-colored fish.  I took them off\n\t\t\t the earrings and put them on safety pins, and thought that I\n\t\t\t would give one to Pat Fish if I got the chance to speak to him.\n\t\t\t  As soon as I heard him say, \"Small gold fish,\" I took\n\t\t\t off one pin and tossed it onto the stage.  He looked at it and\n\t\t\t left it lying there.  Pat also told what he referred to as a\n\t\t\t joke and said that he was testing people's reactions to it -\n\t\t\t \"In Seattle there was dead silence.\"  He said that\n\t\t\t when he was about eight, a kid came up to him on the playground\n\t\t\t and said, \"You know your dad?\" and he said yeah and\n\t\t\t the kid said, \"He drives with his brakes on.\"  Later\n\t\t\t on in the set, he finished up a song by saying, \"He drives\n\t\t\t with his brakes on, ladies and gentlemen, the Jazz Butcher.\"</P>\n\t\t\t<P>After \"Girls Who Keep Goldfish,\"\n\t\t\t Pat switched to bass and handed his guitar to Owen Jones, who\n\t\t\t sang his song \"<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Don't Let Me Keep You] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Don't Let Me Keep You</i>\n\t<span class=\"song_author\">(<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Owen Jones] -->\n\t<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/owen_jones.html\">Owen Jones</a>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[person:Owen Jones]:END -->)</span>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Don't Let Me Keep You]:END -->,\" which was very\n\t\t\t sad and lovely.  Max then sang \"Who Loves You Now?\"\n\t\t\t  Then Pat switched back to guitar and introduced Patrick Byrne,\n\t\t\t who he said had flown all the way from London that day to play\n\t\t\t with them.  He was wearing a light-colored suit coat over a dark\n\t\t\t shirt, and had a rather peculiar haircut with shaved sides; we\n\t\t\t had noticed him outside the club before the show.  He played\n\t\t\t kazoo and harmonica.  Max sang \"D.R.I.N.K.,\" with kazoo\n\t\t\t accompaniment by Pat, Patrick and (I think) Owen.  Pat then introduced\n\t\t\t Steven B. Ballantine, who joined them on bass.  He was someone\n\t\t\t whose name I didn't recognize - he looked young and a little\n\t\t\t shy, and was wearing a suit, I think.  Near the end of the set,\n\t\t\t Pat thanked him especially and said that he drove the van on\n\t\t\t the West Coast, played bass \"and is also the band's attorney.\"\n\t\t\t  Following the drinking theme, they played \"Soul Happy Hour.\"\n\t\t\t  On the recorded version, the introductory lyric is \"The\n\t\t\t best things in life are free/But you can give them to the S.D.P.\"\n\t\t\t (the Social Democratic Party).  When they played the song, Pat\n\t\t\t sang, \"The best things in life are free/But you can give\n\t\t\t them to Spacemen 3.\"  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>As I mentioned before, most of my favorite\n\t\t\t Jazz Butcher songs are the woozy, romantic ones from his later\n\t\t\t albums.  Since they were all recorded with a different band,\n\t\t\t I didn't really expect him to play them, and he didn't.  The\n\t\t\t one song I was really dying to hear was \"Angels,\" from\n\t\t\t <U>Distressed Gentlefolk</U>.  (Regular readers of <U>Feedback</U>\n\t\t\t will recall my paean to \"Angels\" a few issues back.)\n\t\t\t After \"Soul Happy Hour,\" Pat sang a couple of lines\n\t\t\t from \"The Sandman,\" and then broke into \"Angels.\"\n\t\t\t  I was ecstatic.  Superlatives fail me.  In the verse that begins,\n\t\t\t \"I can see them...\" he added the lines, \"They're\n\t\t\t up in heaven...I know because I've been there.\"  Possibly\n\t\t\t the closest thing I've ever had to an orgasmic musical experience.\n\t\t\t  Wow.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Kevin Haskins joined the band on drums, wearing\n\t\t\t a black shirt, with black hair in a sort of quiff.  Pat Fish\n\t\t\t picked up the string of fish I had thrown onstage earlier, held\n\t\t\t it up and said \"Thanks for the fish,\" then put it in\n\t\t\t the pocket of his suit coat.  He introduced the next song as\n\t\t\t about being on \"the wrong side of the Carpathians\"\n\t\t\t - \"The Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula.\"  Toward the\n\t\t\t end of the song, Pat's amp stopped working.  The roadies came\n\t\t\t up on stage and started trying to fix it.  People were yelling\n\t\t\t out song titles and suggestions.  Someone said he should play\n\t\t\t through Max's amp and Pat said, \"You don't want me coming\n\t\t\t through there,\" and Max looked horrified and shook his head.\n\t\t\t  Someone else said, \"Break up,\" and Pat said, \"We\n\t\t\t tried that.\"  After the same person yelled about four song\n\t\t\t titles, Pat said, \"Honey, I'd be happy to be able to play\n\t\t\t you ANY FUCKING THING right now.\"  He then announced that\n\t\t\t they would take a short break while \"the Cathy and Rob show\"\n\t\t\t tried to fix the amp, and then more or less ran off stage, very\n\t\t\t exasperated.  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Eventually, the roadies got the fuse changed\n\t\t\t in the amp, possibly the only time I've ever participated in\n\t\t\t an ovation for roadies.  Incidentally, the crowd at the show\n\t\t\t was one of the most good-humored and positive crowds I've ever\n\t\t\t been in.  Clearly everyone was there because they really wanted\n\t\t\t to be, and most of the audience seemed to know most of the songs.\n\t\t\t  One person kept yelling, \"Stop mucking about!\" but\n\t\t\t I think they thought they were being funny.  After the second\n\t\t\t or third time, Pat said, \"Go see a band that didn't break\n\t\t\t up four years ago.\"  </P>\n\t\t\t<P>Pat came back onstage without his suit jacket\n\t\t\t and said something about having his coat off now.  They played\n\t\t\t \"She's on Drugs\" and \"Mr. Odd,\" two of my\n\t\t\t favorites from 1990's <U>Cult of the Basement</U>.  Pat then\n\t\t\t introduced \"Walk With the Devil\" as \"having been\n\t\t\t written during the Cold War, when writing about St. Petersburg\n\t\t\t was supposed to be ironic.\"  They played \"President\n\t\t\t Reagan's Birthday Present\" and \"Caroline Wheeler's\n\t\t\t Birthday Present.\"  Then Max played his song \"The Long\n\t\t\t Night Starts,\" which was quite lovely.  Pat sang a verse\n\t\t\t of \"Purple Rain\" as the intro to \"Rain,\"\n\t\t\t a song that I'd never heard, yet which sounded oddly familiar.\n\t\t\t  Next was \"Girlfriend,\" another favorite of mine -\n\t\t\t \"Well, it's funny cause I thought that it could have turned\n\t\t\t out quite romantic/But it isn't like that, which is fine, cause\n\t\t\t it means I can stand it.\"  At some point in here, someone\n\t\t\t brought a beer up to the stage and tried to hand it to Pat. \n\t\t\t He had his back turned to the audience and Max Eider tapped him\n\t\t\t on the arm and said, \"Pat, someone's trying to give you\n\t\t\t a drink.\"  Pat introduced \"Old Snakey,\" from 1995's\n\t\t\t <U>Illuminate</U>, as being from \"a record that never even\n\t\t\t got released over here,\" and referred to it as \"a newer\n\t\t\t old song.\"  He made great snake movements with his hands\n\t\t\t while he was singing it.  His moves were great - he danced and\n\t\t\t did great stuff with his feet while he played, and ended a couple\n\t\t\t of songs with Max standing up and Pat falling to his knees at\n\t\t\t the end of the song.  It sounds clich&eacute; when I describe\n\t\t\t it, but it looked very spontaneous, natural and cool while they\n\t\t\t were doing it. \"Bigfoot Motel\" was next, followed by\n\t\t\t \"Zombie Love,\" which Pat introduced as being in \"the\n\t\t\t saddest of all keys, A minor.\"  I found myself liking the\n\t\t\t goofier songs a lot more when I saw and heard them being played\n\t\t\t live.</P>\n\t\t\t<P>After \"Zombie Love,\" the band left\n\t\t\t the stage and returned, after much applause, to play a cover\n\t\t\t of Camper Van Beethoven's \"Take the Skinheads Bowling,\"\n\t\t\t which Pat dedicated to \"my close personal friend Curtis\n\t\t\t E. Johnson,\" in whose band, the Stranger Tractors, Pat Fish\n\t\t\t plays drums.  They left the stage again, and returned again.\n\t\t\t  Pat sang a verse I didn't recognize about \"a thing of beauty\n\t\t\t is a joy forever,\" and then said that the next song was\n\t\t\t about a particular section of highway outside Northampton, Pat's\n\t\t\t home.  He then said, \"It's not what you think,\" and\n\t\t\t chanted the \"One-two-three-four-five-six!\" intro to\n\t\t\t the very special Jazz Butcher version of Jonathan Richman's \"Roadrunner\"\n\t\t\t with a section about \"Maximilian Eider did not know it,\n\t\t\t but he was entering the Twilight Zone/That's where he went/Said\n\t\t\t I wouldn't live next door to one if I were you...Rock and roll\n\t\t\t vegetable live next door to you/Rock and roll vegetable, vegetable\n\t\t\t stew/Roadrunner, roadrunner...\"</P>\n\t\t\t<P>This ended the show.  I went over to Jerry\n\t\t\t and Sophie.  Sophie immediately said, \"I loved him, he's\n\t\t\t so cute!\" which would have made her my friend for life,\n\t\t\t except that she already is.  Jerry said that I looked so ecstatic\n\t\t\t that he thought my facial muscles were going to cramp up from\n\t\t\t smiling (they did get sore toward the end of the show, but it\n\t\t\t was a small price to pay.)  Part of me wanted to stay and try\n\t\t\t to meet Pat Fish, and part of me was scared to, and Sophie wanted\n\t\t\t to go home, and so we left.</P>"},{"gigtext_id":352,"datetime":"1999-09-23T20:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Scott Deschaine","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Here's a feeble attempt to convey the thrill that was the Jazz Butcher\n\t\t\tConspiracy show at the Wetlands in New York City on September 23, 1999.

Surprised at how many\n\t\t\tearly twenty-somethings were there, and how many I talked with liked The\n\t\t\tButcher's older stuff. How did they hear it?? One gent told me his first\n\t\t\texposure to the Jazz Butcher's music was hearing \"Big Questions\" used as a\n\t\t\ttheme song for a television show that reviewed music CDs! Anyone know the name\n\t\t\tof this show and other details?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere was a short set by an opening band. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMr. Pat Fish and Mr. Max Eider took the stage. Pat said, \"Welcome to the last\n\t\t\tgreat rock concert of the century!\" And then they began gently playing what\n\t\t\tthey called their \"pussy\" songs. \"Partytime\" was first. Over succeeding songs,\n\t\t\tPat and Max were joined by Mr. Owen Jones, <!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Steve Valentine] -->\n\t<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[person:Steve Valentine]:END --> (who Pat later\n\t\t\tthanked for, among other things, driving the van and being his attorney!), and\n\t\t\tanother gent whose name I missed but who flew in from England just to play\n\t\t\twith the band that night.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor those who care, to me the sound mix was fantastic, perfect.

Don't quote me on the exact order of\n\t\t\tthe songs, but along came \"Falling in Love,\" \"She's On Drugs,\" \"Soul Happy\n\t\t\tHour,\" \"D.R.I.N.K.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYou may have heard \"Jazz Butcher vs. Count Dracula\" before, but you never\n\t\t\theard it like these guys played it that night.

Several times as the show heated up, he stood and walked\n\t\t\taround, seemingly moved by the music and quite enjoying himself. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOwen Jones and <!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Steve Valentine] -->\n\t<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/steve_valentine.html\">Steve Valentine</a>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[person:Steve Valentine]:END --> provided a driving, solid beat, adding OOMPH to\n\t\t\tsongs that deserve it. Some live performances can't live up to recorded\n\t\t\tversions, but I've never heard some of these songs sound so rocking and full\n\t\t\tof life!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd there's Pat Fish, center stage. Singing and playing guitar with control,\n\t\t\tthen letting go with wild abandon, then pulling it all together again. Proudly\n\t\t\tshowing off the talents of the gents around him. And delivering those great\n\t\t\tsongs, one after another. Pat Fish, looking like a natural.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe place was packed, hardly enough room to even move! As the show went on you\n\t\t\tcould see ever increasing numbers of people begin to move with the music. At\n\t\t\tfirst, maybe only die-hard Butcher fans, but then more and more, until those\n\t\t\tstanding still were a small number indeed!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhat's that?

From ILLUMINATE, only \"Old Snakey.\" This is a\n\t\t\tflat out horror story of a song - get that shocker ending!!  On stage, this\n\t\t\thad a galloping, jerky quality quite different from the slithering riotousness\n\t\t\tof the album version. When introducing the song, Pat made some comment about\n\t\t\tSony deciding not to release ILLUMINATE in the U.S. - talk about a horror\n\t\t\tstory! What's the deal there? Anyone know why they chose not to release this\n\t\t\tmonster of a disc?? \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Angels\" - HIT THE CEILING! Why that girl over there is actually crying! Who\n\t\t\tcan blame her??\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Zombie Love\" - YEAH GO! These guys are out of control! This song just\n\t\t\tCOULDN'T sound so menacing and driving, but it does!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFirst encore - \"Take the Skinheads Bowling.\" \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSecond encore - \"Roadrunner.\" The whole place was bouncing.

September 23, 1999.</h2>\n\t\t\t<b>SPECIAL REPORT  and PHOTOS by  WILSON NEATE</b><p>\n\t\t\tThis gig was billed as \"THE LAST SHOW EVER!\" for the Jazz Butcher and\n\t\t\tat the risk of sounding overly millennial and apocalyptic, I do hope that\n\t\t\tby the time the dust settles on the history of rock, sorting the men from\n\t\t\tthe boy bands, Pat Fish will have been recognized as one of the Great\n\t\t\tBritish songwriters alongside such luminaries as Ray Davies.  The total\n\t\t\tValue-For-Money experience of the Jazz Butcher live, coupled with a decade's\n\t\t\tworth of consistently fine recordings, make you wonder how on earth it is\n\t\t\tthat Pat Fish still remains a marginal entity, his status bordering on that\n\t\t\tmost horrible of all rock cliches: the well kept secret, the, ahem, cult figure.<p>\n\n\t\t\tBut never mind, I come to praise The Jazz Butcher not to bury him/them.\n\t\t\tBesides, as Mr Fish himself pointed out last night, this band has been around\n\t\t\tthe block more than a few times already and actually split up four years\n\t\t\tago anyway; and given the reception that they got from a packed house of\n\t\t\tJazz Butcher Conspirators of all stripes, I suspect that they'll be back\n\t\t\tsometime next century.  Indeed, The Jazz Butcher draws a very eclectic,\n\t\t\tboy/girl crowd these days: suits and ties straight from their law offices,\n\t\t\tyounger indie enthusiasts who missed out on the 80s but who have a sense\n\t\t\tof history and taste, and, of course, heavy drinkers of all persuasions,\n\t\t\tshapes and hairstyles came together to sing along to two hours of the greatest hits.<p>\n\n\t\t\tWhether or not it was the last show ever, it was certainly the last show\n\t\t\ton their current North American tour, for which Fish has reenlisted his\n\t\t\tvery able former cohorts: ex-Bauhaus and Love and Rockets drummer Kevin\n\t\t\tHaskins, multi-instrumentalist Owen Jones and, of course, guitar maestro Max Eider.<p>\n\n\t\t\tThings got off to an unexpected start as this reviewer was granted his completely\n\t\t\tpathetic 15, er, seconds of fame when the Butcher opened the proceedings\n\t\t\tby introducing him to the crowd as England football celebrity and husband\n\t\t\tof Posh Spice, David Beckham.  The moral of this very short story is, if\n\t\t\tyou've got blond hair and are wearing a Manchester United football jersey,\n\t\t\tdo not stand too close to the stage when someone with wits as sharp as the\n\t\t\tButcher's is on the prowl.  It being an American audience, though, I don't\n\t\t\tthink that anyone really got the joke - I mean, people actually applauded\n\t\t\tand I even gave a polite, yet awkward, wave of recognition to play along.<p>\n\n\t\t\tBut enough about me, Pat Fish and Max Eider set the festive tone for the\n\t\t\tevening, kicking things off as a duo with, not surprisingly, <i>Partytime</i>\n\t\t\t from 1983's <i>Bath of Bacon.</i>  What followed was a two-hour-plus set\n\t\t\twith (and occasionally without) the rest of the band mapping out the finest\n\t\t\tmoments in the JB catalogue, except <i>Southern Mark Smith</i> curiously\n\t\t\tenough, despite the relentless shouting of requests for it.  But then we\n\t\t\tgot to hear pretty much everything else.<p>\n\n\t\t\tNevertheless, the set was truncated by a 20 minute intermission when Fish's\n\t\t\tguitar amp chose a particularly inappropriate time to call it a day.  Consequently,\n\t\t\tthe band retreated from the stage to regroup, the Butcher himself visibly\n\t\t\tfrustrated and uncharacteristically flustered; still, it was a special occasion,\n\t\t\t"},{"gigtext_id":354,"datetime":"1999-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The presence of David J and Kevin Haskins (aka The Bowerhouse Brothers) \n\t\t\tleant something of a horror rock element to tonight's set.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith Kevin on the drums, Mister Jones was free to take on a free-ranging \n\t\t\tmidfield role, playing keyboards, accordion, guitar and percussion as well \n\t\t\tas singing.

In the mementos department \n\t\t\tI now have two snagged set lists in my collection - the first from 1992's \n\t\t\tshow at nearby Nightstage, and the second from this evening's somewhat more \n\t\t\tintimate performance at TT's.

I spent a lot of time looking at my notes and saying,\n\t\t\t\"What?\" \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm moving back to Lansing, Michigan next month, so this was probably the last\n\t\t\tconcert I'll see for a while - and what a great concert it was!   This was the\n\t\t\tfirst time I'd ever been to TT the Bear's.  It had a much nicer vibe than the\n\t\t\tMiddle East - friendlier employees and a nicer layout.  There's a wide entry\n\t\t\thall between the two sides of the club.  At the rear of the hall are the\n\t\t\tbathrooms.  Off the left side of the hall is the bar, with seating at the far\n\t\t\tside of it and a small room with a pool table to the left of the bathrooms. \n\t\t\tOff the right side of the hall is the stage area, with the stage at the front\n\t\t\tand the sound booth at the back.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI had thought about going to the show late, since there were three opening\n\t\t\tbands, but I got too antsy and ended up getting there a little before nine.  I\n\t\t\twas glad I did, because when I arrived, the club was nearly empty, and Pat and\n\t\t\tKathie were just standing around at the merchandise table.  I got to talk to\n\t\t\tthem a bit and got Pat to sign my Condition Blue CD insert.  Pat said, \"I like\n\t\t\tpeople who bring their own Sharpies.\"  (I always carry a Sharpie - you never\n\t\t\tknow when you're going to need to graffiti something.)  Pat said something\n\t\t\tabout not being sure what they were going to play, as it was the first show of\n\t\t\tthe tour.  I lobbied unsuccessfully for \"Racheland.\"  Forgot to mention that on\n\t\t\tApril 13, 1796, the first elephant arrived in America.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe first band, Device, introduced themselves as being \"English, like the Jazz\n\t\t\tButcher Conspiracy,\" and kept talking about how their music was drum and bass,\n\t\t\t\"so we'd all be able to recognize it when it came over here.\"  Okay.  One of\n\t\t\tthe guitarists looked like a young Mark E. Smith.  The second band, the Shelley\n\t\t\tWinters Project, had a violinist, a guitarist who was too cute and knew it, and\n\t\t\ta keyboard player/vocalist who introduced the band by saying \"We're not Devo.\" \n\t\t\tIt's true, they aren't Devo, although the singer had that Church of the\n\t\t\tSubgenius vibe.  They were reasonably amusing.  At this point a guy came up to\n\t\t\tme and asked me if I was a writer.  He was from Your Sound, a web site which\n\t\t\twas supposedly \"sponsoring\" the show.  I don't know what that consisted of,\n\t\t\tother than having a rather ugly banner hanging on the back wall of the stage. \n\t\t\tThen he wanted to know if I wanted to write for their web site.  I accepted a\n\t\t\tbusiness card and he went away.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd then it was AEUK time!  (This now seems to be the \"official\" name of the\n\t\t\tband - or at least they introduced themselves as AEUK, not Ass Eaters UK.) \n\t\t\tThey've got a new singer, who can actually sing - she had kind of a\n\t\t\tplatinum-haired Barbie doll New York look.  I thought they were better than\n\t\t\tthey were at last fall's Wetlands show, although they drove most of the\n\t\t\taudience into the bar.  They did a cover of \"Tie Your Mother Down\" by Queen, so\n\t\t\tI'll give them points for that.  \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEarlier in the evening, Pat and Max had carried a couple of the barstools\n\t\t\tacross to the side of the stage, and Pat now brought them onstage.  Owen\n\t\t\tstarted setting up his drums, Pat and Kathie were unsnarling guitar cords, Max\n\t\t\twas positioning his effects box. Then everyone went off and Pat and Max\n\t\t\treappeared, wearing sunglasses - Max's were reddish-brown and oval, Pat's were\n\t\t\tretro-shaped and silvery.  When I saw them in NYC last year, Max was at the\n\t\t\textreme right of the stage and Pat was at the center, in front of the drums. \n\t\t\tThis time their positions were reversed, with Pat at the extreme right of the\n\t\t\tstage. They seated themselves, and after a bit of a struggle with the reverb on\n\t\t\tPat's amp - he said something about sounding like Chrissie Hynde - they played\n\t\t\t\"Partytime.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHere's a phenomenon I don't understand: when Pat and Max were walking around\n\t\t\tthe club together, Max seemed shorter than Pat, but when they're both onstage\n\t\t\ttogether, Max is taller.  Can anyone explain this?  Both Pat and Max wore dark\n\t\t\tsuits, Max with a black polo-neck shirt and Doc Martens, Pat with a white knit\n\t\t\tcollarless button-neck shirt and black boots. Pat was playing a black Fender\n\t\t\twith a Schwa alien head and a Sumo sticker.  After \"Partytime,\" Owen joined\n\t\t\tthem, wearing black jeans and t-shirt, and seated himself.  Pat then pulled out\n\t\t\tsome drink tickets and asked if anyone in the audience would go and get them a\n\t\t\tcouple of beers.  A guy near the right-hand side of the stage was dispatched\n\t\t\tfor three Rolling Rocks, and Pat then said, \"That's the last we'll see of him.\" \n\t\t\tHowever, he reappeared, beers in hand, during the next tune, \"Girls Who Keep\n\t\t\tGoldfish,\" with Owen on accordion.  (Later someone kept bringing Pat bottles of\n\t\t\tBass ale.)  Pat said something about getting slower as you get older.  Kathie\n\t\t\tcame up and sat at the drum kit to provide backing vocals and percussion for\n\t\t\tthe next couple of songs.  They played Max's song, \"Baby It's You,\" which he\n\t\t\treferred to as \"being called 'Baby, Baby, Baby' or something like that.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPat removed his shades and switched to bass.  There was a persistent buzzing\n\t\t\tfrom one of the amps at the left-hand side of the stage, and he said, \"Love\n\t\t\tthat buzz!\"  One of the audience members responded, \"Waiting for the Love\n\t\t\tBuzz!\" to which Pat sternly replied, \"That's as bad as one of mine.\"  Owen\n\t\t\tplayed guitar and sang his lovely, sad song \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\"  Then\n\t\t\tKathie left the stage, Owen moved to the drums and Pat took up the guitar,\n\t\t\tsaying, \"It's like progressive rock, all this instrument swapping.\"  He then\n\t\t\tintroduced \"DRINK,\" with Max on vocals, by saying, \"It's cabaret time.\" \n\t\t\tAfterward he said, \"You should see us down the library.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSteve Valentine then joined the band on bass, standing at the left-hand side of\n\t\t\tthe stage.  Max sang, \"Who Loves You Now?\"  Next was \"Girlfriend,\" a favorite\n\t\t\tof mine, with some very fierce guitar at the end and Pat shaking his hair\n\t\t\tabout.  He introduced \"Mr. Odd\" by saying, \"This next number's not necessarily\n\t\t\tone you'd associate with this collection of individuals...\" Max stood up to\n\t\t\tplay \"Mr. Odd,\" which was followed by \"Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.\" \n\t\t\tPat then paused to tune his guitar, saying something about sounding like\n\t\t\tSpacemen 3, and then began \"Soul Happy Hour\" by singing, \"The best things in\n\t\t\tlife are free, but you can give them to Spacemen 3.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax then sang a new song, a fast rocking number called \"Rose Marie.\"  Pat\n\t\t\tintroduced the next song as being set in New Orleans on a 48-hour drinking\n\t\t\tbinge, \"where I met a lovely girl that became my girlfriend.\"  The song was\n\t\t\t\"Sweet Water,\" off of Waiting for the Love Bus, a delicious surprise.  \"She's\n\t\t\tOn Drugs\" was next, followed by a new song which Max sang, \"Diamorphine.\"  Max\n\t\t\tcommented, \"Old age is not for sissies,\" before he started the song, which was\n\t\t\tone of the highlights of the show.  My notes say, \"Pat heavy distorted guitar\n\t\t\tYES!\"  I think I cried a little, and I know the big goofy grin showed up on my\n\t\t\tace around here.  Pat mentioned that their new LP was to be called Rotten\n\t\t\tSoul, and sang another new song, \"Niagara,\" which was also excellent. \n\t\t\tAfterward Pat said, \"We should be pretty good at that round about Iowa,\" at\n\t\t\twhich the guy behind me announced that he was from Iowa City.  Pat then asked\n\t\t\tfor a show of hands from anyone who was NOT from Iowa City.  He then used, \"Be\n\t\t\tvery careful while traveling through the Midwest...\" as the introduction to\n\t\t\t\"Bigfoot Motel.\"  \n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThey didn't play \"Racheland,\" but Pat introduced the next one as \"a song about\n\t\t\tjust how shitty things can get around the home,\" and they played \"She's a\n\t\t\tYo-Yo\" from Condition Blue.   This was an excellent ending to an excellent set. \n\t\t\tThe band left the stage and the house lights came up, but they returned for a\n\t\t\tvery fast encore of \"Take The Skinheads Bowling.\"  (Earlier Pat had commented\n\t\t\ton seeing the time in big glowing orange numbers on the clock across from the\n\t\t\tstage.)

I won't bother with a long \n\t\t\treview, as it's all pretty much been said about the other shows so far, but \n\t\t\tit was great.  I think I preferred seeing them in the MIT over a club like \n\t\t\tLaga.  The small room created a much more intimate atmosphere, and was \n\t\t\tplenty of space for everyone that came.  Sound quality was good, the only \n\t\t\tlow point being \"She's a Yo-Yo\", when the vocals were so low in the mix \n\t\t\tthat they couldn't really be heard.  I didn't get the set list, but I think \n\t\t\tit was about the same as has been posted so far.  They played for about an \n\t\t\thour and twenty minutes total, not counting the breaks between encores.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnyway, I wanted to throw in my comments on the merchandise.  There were, \n\t\t\tof course, the CDs.  I picked up Max's album, I'd forgotten how good it is \n\t\t\t(it's been a long time since I've listened to my vinyl copy).  The shirts I \n\t\t\tfound to be rather disappointing.  There were three t-shirt designs . . \n\t\t\t.  One that just had \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" written in sort of a \n\t\t\thexagon thing (this was also available in a \"baseball\" shirt with red \n\t\t\tsleeves).  Really boring.  One with a photo of the band from 1984 and the \n\t\t\tcaption \"I thought it had stopped -- JBC 1984\".  This was the best of them, \n\t\t\tso I picked it up, though I would have much preferred one that actually \n\t\t\tsaid \"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy\" on it.  Then there was one with the \n\t\t\tGlorious and Idiotic logo on it, but for some reason it also had AEUK \n\t\t\tplastered all over it.  If it weren't for that, I would probably have \n\t\t\tbought this one, but since I didn't really care for AEUK, it was out.  None \n\t\t\tof the t-shirts seemed particularly well printed.  Then there were the polo \n\t\t\tshirts, but I've never been particularly into polo shirts, and the concept \n\t\t\tof one with a band logo on it just seems really odd to me, so I didn't \n\t\t\treally look at them.  It's a shame the shirts weren't better done -- I \n\t\t\twould have been more than happy to pay more for a better printed one with a \n\t\t\tbetter design on it.

They were here last night and they were\n\t\t\tgreat.  I'm so glad I was able to see them live.  I didn't get home until\n\t\t\t2:30 so I'm paying for it today, but they're worth it.\n\t\t\tThe club was nice.  I had never been there before.  It's upstairs from a\n\t\t\tbowling alley.  It's pretty small, and it's half pool hall and half\n\t\t\talternative-rock club.  There's a good size dance floor, and there are\n\t\t\ttables behind the dance floor, and on platforms on either side.  We sat at a\n\t\t\ttable near the front of one platform.  At one point during the first band,\n\t\t\tPat Fish and Max Eider sat down in front of us on the platform itself (not\n\t\t\tin chairs).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI probably won't get the song titles right, but here goes.  They started out\n\t\t\twith just Pat and Max doing It's Party Time and Girls Who Keep Goldfish.\n\t\t\tThen they were joined on stage by an accordion player whose last name was\n\t\t\tJones (didn't catch his first name) who later turned out to be the drummer.\n\t\t\tThey did a couple songs like that, then Jones played guitar and sang one\n\t\t\tsong that was beautiful... it might be called I Won't Keep You or something\n\t\t\tlike that.  Then the bass player came out and the whole band was in place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThey played for about an hour and a half.  Their songs are so great!!  There\n\t\t\twas a cool song that mentioned Michael Jackson, but unfortunately I don't\n\t\t\tremember any of the other lyrics.  There was another song that had the word\n\t\t\tgirlfriend in the chorus a lot, and that was another really good one.  Some\n\t\t\tothers that I remember are Niagara, Sex and Travel, Sweetwater, Mr. Odd,\n\t\t\tGirl-Go.  They did a couple songs that Pat said were new, and I think the\n\t\t\tnames were Daughter Morphine and Come On Marie.  Come On Marie sounded\n\t\t\tMotown-ish, and Pat said he was excited about playing it in Detroit.  He\n\t\t\tmentioned several times that he likes Detroit a lot.  He was really funny\n\t\t\tbetween songs.  At one point they were having equipment problems and Pat\n\t\t\tleft the stage & returned with a notebook which must have been his tour\n\t\t\tjournal.  He told us how many eggs the band has eaten during the tour &\n\t\t\tstuff like that.  Despite the equipment problems, they looked like they were\n\t\t\thaving a lot of fun.  There weren't a whole lot of people there, but those\n\t\t\twho were there really liked the band, were yelling out song titles, etc.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMost people stood in front of the stage.  We could see good from our table,\n\t\t\tand I'm beyond the point where I can stand for a whole set anyway.  Pat came\n\t\t\tback for an encore, which was A Thing of Beauty, then the rest of the guys\n\t\t\tcame back on and they played Take the Skinheads Bowling.  Then they left the\n\t\t\tstage, and people were still making a lot of noise, so they came back for\n\t\t\tanother encore.  I don't know what it was, but it was excellent.  My friend\n\t\t\tKaren liked them a lot, and wants to get some of their CD's (if she can find\n\t\t\tthem).\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe art gallery show was fun too.

This was the\n\t\t\tfirst show I have attended at Shuba's, and it was a real treat to see Pat\n\t\t\tand the boys in such a small, intimate venue.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI arrived at 10:00, about one hour after the show started.  I was pleased\n\t\t\tto see the sign on the door \"Tonight's Show Sold Out\".  At Shuba's that\n\t\t\tmeant a crowd of approximately 250-300.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tArriving late, I missed AEUK (thanks to Doc, who informed me I was lucky to\n\t\t\thave missed it.  It was great to meet another list member in the flesh).\n\t\t\tAt about 10:15 the next act came on, Mezodigm.  They were what you would\n\t\t\texpect from an opening band.  Not the best I've seen, not the worst I've\n\t\t\tseen, but an opening band.  They sounded like a cross between Syd Barrett\n\t\t\tand Catherine Wheel, a wall of noise with meaningless lyricks.  The best\n\t\t\tpart was when an audience member yelled \"What does Mezodigm mean?\", to\n\t\t\twhich the singer merely scowled.  After the set, I had a chance to ask the\n\t\t\tsame question to the bass player while in line for the \"facilities\", and he\n\t\t\tchuckled and said \"I get in trouble when I tell people it means 'a\n\t\t\thalf-assed paradigm'\".  That was a better reply than the singer's.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFinally, at about 11:30, Pat and Max hit the stage, both wearing black, and\n\t\t\tboth donning their sunglasses.  They launched into Partytime and, unlike\n\t\t\tthe San Francisco show, rapidly escalated into faster and louder songs,\n\t\t\twith the entire band on stage by the fourth or fifth song.  When Pat\n\t\t\tintroduced Steve Valentine, he referred to him as \"Son of Chicago, Attorney\n\t\t\tat Law and Bad-Ass-Mother-F*cker\".  I did not record the set list, but it\n\t\t\twas basically identical to the lists posted for other shows on the tour.\n\t\t\tThe sound was very good, not excellent like in San Francisco.  Also, the\n\t\t\tmix of songs tended to focus, especially as the show headed into the early\n\t\t\tmorning hours, on the faster rockers (She's a Yo-Yo comes to mind).  The\n\t\t\tthree songs from their forthcoming album were fantastic.  Normally I'm\n\t\t\tbored stiff when a band plays songs I have not heard before, but these\n\t\t\talready sounded like old friends.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe T-shirts looked cheap, like they would fit a GI Joe action figure if\n\t\t\tlaundered.  One style featured a 1984 photo of Pat, Max and Owen from the\n\t\t\tcover of (I think, I don't have it so I'm going on memory) The Gift of\n\t\t\tMusic.  The other style featured a heptagon (that's a seven-sided figure,\n\t\t\tfor the geometrically challenged) with the letters JBC in the center.  I\n\t\t\tpassed on those, but did pick up a Max Eider CD for $15.  It seemed like a\n\t\t\tlot of people were scooping up Max CDs and G&I CDs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the end of the regular set the band stood off to the side of the stage\n\t\t\tfor about 30 seconds before returning for their first encore.  Pat and Max\n\t\t\twere having a good chuckle over this, because the side of the stage was in\n\t\t\tplain view to everyone, and it was quite obvious they weren't going\n\t\t\tanywhere.  They played two encores, both short (two or so songs, I cannot\n\t\t\tremember exactly).  The crowd really glommed onto Take the Skinheads Bowling.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAll in all, an excellent evening.  The audience was very deep into the\n\t\t\tmusic.  Even during the \"quieter\" songs, the crowd was intensely listening,\n\t\t\twith very little conversation noise.  The whole band seemed to really\n\t\t\tappreciate the reception.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAdditional treat.

But please be\n\t\t\tassured it was very well-lit, well-peopled, fairly clean and without any\n\t\t\tthreatening types roaming about.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe venue is called Shinjuku Loft, and being named such, you might\n\t\t\texpect it to be on a building's upper level. Good guess, however it is\n\t\t\tactually level -2, the lowest basement level. I showed up at just after\n\t\t\t6:00, opening time and more than a little concerned since I had\n\t\t\tneglected to bother purchasing an advance ticket. I was then relieved to\n\t\t\tsee that some tickets were still available. Cost was relatively\n\t\t\tprincely, at 6500 Yen. Ouch! Well, a drop in the bucket compared to what\n\t\t\tI had shelled out for this venture. At least the price included one\n\t\t\tbeverage of my choice.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWalking down the steps to the club entrance, you can see that one side,\n\t\t\tentered to the right,  is basically a small bar with a few tables and\n\t\t\tchairs; the left entrance yields a cozy room with standing area for\n\t\t\tabout 300, a decent-sized stage (for the purpose), a small bar, and on\n\t\t\tSaturday night, a girl spinning JBC tunes on two of two turntables.\n\t\t\tImmediately to the right as you walked in (providing of course, that you\n\t\t\tactually happened to be there), Vinyl Japan had set up a counter with\n\t\t\tmost of the available JBC CD's, Max's, Dislocation Dance CD's, and...\n\t\t\tmore JBC vinyl than I had ever seen (me having seen only Big Planet\n\t\t\tScarey Planet on vinyl before). So, prepare to kick your collective\n\t\t\tselves, the following were present, and I'm sure I am forgetting some:\n\t\t\tScandal in Bohemia, Distressed Gentlefolk, JBC We Love You (?), Bath of\n\t\t\tBacon, and more I'm pretty sure. And before you ask, I didn't buy any of\n\t\t\tit, 'cept for Rotten Soul, and having bought Max's CD at Virgin earlier\n\t\t\tin the day. Also present were some JBC Japan Tour T-shirts, some JBC\n\t\t\tbuttons and Dislocation Dance T-shirts.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe crowd was... about 97% Japanese (imagine that!), and by 6:30 or so I\n\t\t\twould say more than 200 were patiently and politely milling about. Pat\n\t\t\tcame out about that time, to little fanfare, and was surrounded by small\n\t\t\tgroups who patiently waited their turn to say hello and to get various\n\t\t\titems autographed. Pat was extremely gracious, as he always seems to be,\n\t\t\tand sat on the floor signing records for 10 minutes or so.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPromptly at 7:00 the show began with Max coming out and playing some of\n\t\t\this tunes, soon to be joined by Owen on accordion. What can I say? Of\n\t\t\tcourse they both did a great job, both seeming pretty relaxed. Sound was\n\t\t\treally excellent, practically perfect in the small room, and to say\n\t\t\tyou could hear a pin drop directly after and before the tunes would not\n\t\t\tbe understatement.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax played for about 30 minutes and after a short break, Dislocation\n\t\t\tDance came on.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDislocation Dance is a U.K. group that played together in the early\n\t\t\t'80's. I was told they had not played together since 1982. Vinyl Japan\n\t\t\thad re-released their CD('s?) and brought them over from U.K. The band\n\t\t\twas comprised of your typical pop instrumentation, with a female lead\n\t\t\tvocalist and a trumpet player.  The drummer and trumpet player have been\n\t\t\tplaying together professionally since the early '80's, if not before.\n\t\t\tHope my info is correct. Anyway, they were an interesting complement to\n\t\t\tthe JBC, extremely tight, extremely polished, and the trumpet player\n\t\t\tad-libbed around their tunes all night (or at least for the 60 minutes\n\t\t\tthey played). As well, they were well-received by the crowd (which\n\t\t\tincluded various members of the JBC, from whom I gleaned most of the\n\t\t\tabove info, so speaking of which...)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI was blessed to have been in the company of Max, Owen and Pat at\n\t\t\tvarious times during the DD set, as well as Max's sister Ann, and\n\t\t\tSteve's girlfriend Linda (Steve was running about somewhere but I did\n\t\t\tnot speak with him until Sunday night -- I think). They were all quite\n\t\t\tdown-to-earth, grateful to be in Japan, happy to be there, appeciative\n\t\t\tof the crowd -- you get the picture (and speaking of which I took about\n\t\t\t50 digital photos -- a smattering of which might actually be decent and\n\t\t\tI'll send to David Whittemore for his posting disgression (okay,\n\t\t\tDavid?)).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, at around 8:45 or so the JBC came on. The playlist was what you have\n\t\t\tcome to expect from this tour. A personal new favorite of mine is now\n\t\t\tDiamorphine. There was a bit of banter with the crowd, and some banter\n\t\t\tback, especially from the handful of, I believe, Japan-based Canadians\n\t\t\tthat were jumping about in some contrast to the polite and\n\t\t\tjumping-about-to-a-lesser-extent Japanese crowd. I adhered myself to the\n\t\t\tfringe of the westerners group, or perhaps more specifically to Ann, and\n\t\t\ta good time was had by all. And so I guess I did not make too much of a\n\t\t\tspectacle of myself since Ann and Linda (and the band) were still\n\t\t\tspeaking to me by the time the Sunday show rolled around. And perhaps I\n\t\t\thad been the subject of some post-show conversation on Saturday since on\n\t\t\tSunday it was known to the band that I indeed trekked over from China\n\t\t\t(hey, it's only a 3.5 hour flight and I wasn't doing anything else of\n\t\t\tnote last weekend). Pat, whom I had not given my name, came up to me\n\t\t\tSunday and said \"you must be Ray from China.\""},{"gigtext_id":374,"datetime":"2000-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"<a href=\"/japan2000\">Pat's Japan 2000 Travelogue</a>"},{"gigtext_id":375,"datetime":"2000-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"Ray","credit_url":"rlkoke@public1.tpt.tj.cn","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Early afternoon before the show on Sunday, I went to Vinyl Japan -- the\n\t\t\tband had gone there on Saturday. Actually there are 3 separate parts or\n\t\t\tshops (4?) of Vinyl Japan in Shinjuku, each dedicated to one or more\n\t\t\tspecific genres. Part 2 is the one for most of us to want to visit. On\n\t\t\tarrival, what was being played but Rotten Soul. I looked through the\n\t\t\tstore's intersting indie and alt selections, finding and buying a promo\n\t\t\tBeck CD that seemed interesting. After purchasing it I asked, in\n\t\t\tEnglish, as best I could to the helpful and non-English speaking staff\n\t\t\tif I could buy a ticket for the Sunday show. What appeared to be a\n\t\t\tticket was put on the counter in front of me, at which point I tried in\n\t\t\tvain to purchase it, but my offer of Yen was somehow not accepted. I\n\t\t\ttried to explain again I wanted to buy the ticket. My attempt at\n\t\t\texplanation yielded only an offer of a second ticket which I declined.\n\t\t\tSo, feeling like I had stolen a concert ticket, I slowly backed out the\n\t\t\tdoor.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI wasn't completely sure that I had indeed received a free ticket until\n\t\t\tI got into the show, gratis (except for a mandatory 500 Yen drink\n\t\t\tpurchase).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter a bit of rest, I met up with David and his friend Ivor (sp?) (a\n\t\t\tburgeoning fan) near the train station and we made our way to the venue,\n\t\t\tarriving around 6:30. The crowd proceeded to be about 806502214520f what it'd\n\t\t\tbeen on Saturday night; a good turnout for a Sunday JBC show in Japan,\n\t\t\twe felt. I understand from Pat that a great deal of the crowd had been\n\t\t\tthere the previous evening as well.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSunday, Pat did not come out before the show began, but he did show and\n\t\t\tcheer on Max and Owen during the opening set. I still do not recall\n\t\t\tseeing Steve right at that time, but I may not have been looking around\n\t\t\ttoo much. Again, I attached myself to Ann and Linda, did I mention they\n\t\t\tare both delightful people? They took my obsessive JBC-ishness in\n\t\t\tstride, or at least faked it well. I did have a chance to talk with\n\t\t\tSteve a little later in the evening, and of course he was just as\n\t\t\tpleasant and approachable as the Britishers.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax played a few different tunes than on Saturday night, and was equally\n\t\t\tas well received as before. Sound was once again great, I think. The\n\t\t\tcrowd seemed a bit more animated Sunday, or maybe that was because\n\t\t\tSaturday's Canadian contingent was not there to provide the contrast. In\n\t\t\tany event, again, a good time was had by all.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDD's set seemed similar to that of the previous evening. Perhaps they\n\t\t\twere a little more at ease compared to Saturday. Anyway, they all seemed\n\t\t\tto be enjoying themselves and the somewhat more responsive crowd.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe JBC's set was a bit different than Saturday's; I believe they did\n\t\t\tnot play \"She's a Yo Yo\" on Saturday night. Also, Pat came out solo for\n\t\t\tthe first encore and played an old song about cats which I hadn't heard\n\t\t\tbefore. Very enjoyable of course. They seemed to have played a bit\n\t\t\tlonger on Sunday, and afterward we stuck around during which time\n\t\t\tvarious autographs were dispensed. Briefly we retired to the bar\n\t\t\topposite the stage side of the Loft, and despite Owen's efforts to bid\n\t\t\tme a good evening I tagged along for a pleasant and low-key dinner\n\t\t\tattended by both bands, some people from the label, and Ann and Linda.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt was all great fun, I can't say when I 've spent a more enjoyable two\n\t\t\tconsecutive evenings.

Pat and Max were in a good mood and Pat\n\t\t\tthanked the audience continually.  He was making jokes about the small\n\t\t\tcrowd, when Steve joined them he threatened \"soon we will outnumber\n\t\t\tyou!\"  Pat broke a string very early on, not sure what song it was. \n\t\t\tUnlike how the Cleveland show was apparently, they didn't play\n\t\t\thalfheartedly and it was a wonderful introduction for me to JBC live. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfterwards as Owen and Steve were packing up I had them sign a flier I'd\n\t\t\tpulled off the wall.

I was catatonically drunk, but I remember that their set was as satisfying as the turn-out was depressing. Future hot-shit indie-frauds Death Cab for Cutie opened the show, and there were maybe fifteen people there specifically to see them. It was a complete bath for the club, Im sure, as the audience never numbered more than 25, and at least ten of those I know to have gotten in for free. So Death Cabs fifteen fans, who were all either seventeen years old or named Amber Townsend, left as soon as they finished. Death Cab also decided to leave as quickly as possible, trying to duck out before the Jazz Butcher even took the stage. When the club understandably gave Death Cab less money than they expected, members of the band apparently pitched a (no doubt very sensitive) hissy fit. Im not sure what was said, or if there was any physical contact, but whatever happened led to Death Cab being banned from the 40 Watt for almost four years. A year later Ben Gibbard briefly recounted the affair in that horrible Devil in the Woods magazine, and seemed to feel legitimately ashamed about his actions. I didnt witness the altercation, but throughout their performance, and up until the point when they left (attracting as much attention as they could from a crowd of ten), they were visibly pissed about the turn-out, and looked like theyd rather be anywhere else. This was in early 2000, right after their second album had been released, and well before they attained any notable national fame. They didnt have any reason to expect a good turn-out, and their actions made them look like presumptuous assholes.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher, meanwhile, who had much more of a right to be upset, having come all the way from England, took everything in stride. Instead of complaining or moping he addressed the situation the only way men should, with humor and alcohol. He and the Conspiracy (or whatever they were calling themselves then) put on a good, highly entertaining show, and the few of us who gave a shit about them had a damn good time. If the guys in Death Cab had stayed they would have learned something about professionalism, and/or how not to be pathetic dicks.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI got hooked on the Jazz Butcher when I was twelve, thanks to Rich Halls old Onion World program on the original Comedy Channel. Hall had lots of good bands on that program - del Amitri, the Trashcan Sinatras, Big Dipper - but the Jazz Butcher was the most prominent, and the best. Partytime and Southern Mark Smith are two of my favorite songs by the Butcher. I used to listen to them on a tape I made by hooking our television up through the stereo. These songs come from my old vinyl copy of the Bloody Nonsense compilation, which I believe is currently out of print. They sound a lot better when the Sniglet guy isnt talking over them, thats for sure. But so there are a lot of Jazz Butcher compilations out there, and for the most part you'll probably want to stick with his early '80's stuff."},{"gigtext_id":380,"datetime":"2000-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":"review","credit":"John Spence & Diane White","credit_url":"ocbh@juno.com","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Please excuse the ramblings of a couple of very tired yet exicted fans.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMy mother and I, who have been listening to the band since the early\n\t\t\t80's, consider ourselves quitre lucky to have attended both shows, Philly\n\t\t\t& VA,  near our home in Ocean City, Maryland.

She sang backup vocals on Max's new song,\n\t\t\t\"Baby , It's You.\" & Owen's tune \"Don't Let Me Keep You.\"  When she's not\n\t\t\tdoing this, she also restrings the guitars (Pat was playing with a\n\t\t\treligious fervor), drives the band around, and helps to keep them in line\n\t\t\tand make sure things run smoothly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe four song set by AEUK was not what you'd expect at a JBC show.  If\n\t\t\tany of you have listened to the Black Eg album, you'd have a pretty good\n\t\t\tidea what they're like.  Since the drummer and bassist left the tour in\n\t\t\tChicago, they were accompanied by the Barrister of Bass, who was making a\n\t\t\tstatement on global warming by performing in a Baklava.  He must be quite\n\t\t\tpassionate about the subject, as I almost passed out in a sportshirt and\n\t\t\tshorts.  Although most of the other reviews stated that the AEUK members\n\t\t\twere inaccessable, I found the exact opposite.  I talked at great length\n\t\t\tto Chris and Scott (thanks for the T's) and they actually helped organize\n\t\t\tthe tour.  They booked the clubs, helped with the driving, setting up\n\t\t\tinstruments, etc.  Diehard JBC fans, and a pair of very nice guys. \n\t\t\tSorry, I never asked what the acronym means.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt about 10:30 the JBC took to the stage.  I'll get the set list out of\n\t\t\tthe way, and I've included some of the background info the band provided:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<table border=0>\n\t\t\t<tr><td valign=top>\n\t\t\t\tPartytime</td><td valign=top>                      Pat & Max\n\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t<tr><td valign=top>\n\t\t\t\tWhat's The Matter, Boy?</td><td valign=top>\t\tDedicated to the man with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBox on his head\n\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t<tr><td valign=top>\n\t\t\t\tBaby, It's You.</td><td valign=top>                Pat, Max, Owen (Accordian &\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFoot Tambourine), & Kathie (Vocals)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- This is a perfect example of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thow to write a song using the same\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twords over & over, just put\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe word \"Baby\" in it, even if it's a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlittle weird to call your girlfriend,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"baby.\"\n\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t<tr><td valign=top>\n\t\t\t\tDon't Let Me Keep You</td><td valign=top>          Pat (Bass), Max, Owen (Guitar &\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLead Vocal) & Kathie (B Vocal)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Owen's got a great voice, he\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshould sing more.

During one of our habitual fireside conversations\n\t\t\tGeorge had advised me that the citizens of Sheringham in Norfolk\n\t\t\tlived life in the \"classic, old-fashioned and normal style.\"\n\t\t\tIt struck me that George would love to spend his New Year's Eve\n\t\t\tin a Norfolk country house hotel.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAssuming, then, that we had lucked out getting booked by a load\n\t\t\tof mad rich rustics for their private New Year celebrations,\n\t\t\tthe JBC said.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt was only just before Christmas that it was revealed to us\n\t\t\tthat this show was actually open to the public and that we were\n\t\t\tallowed, nay encouraged,  to advertise it. At the same time we\n\t\t\tdiscovered that tickets were a positively Japanese \n\t\t\t&pound;45:00 a head and, perhaps unsurprisingly, they had not been selling\n\t\t\tthat well. That big fat fee suddenly started to look a touch\n\t\t\tmore theoretical. Nonetheless, by this stage we had all made\n\t\t\tour travel arrangements and booked some other UK shows besides,\n\t\t\tso we decided to go ahead with this mental scheme and have as\n\t\t\tmany laughs as possible from the whole weird experience. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn which, the reader will be glad to hear, we were in no wise\n\t\t\tdisappointed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhile the majority of the posse travel up from London by train,\n\t\t\tthe hardcore rhythm section boys and gals drive with the equipment\n\t\t\tfrom NN1.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSteve is at the wheel, superb in his handling of the ubiquitous\n\t\t\t\"roundabouts\"\n\t\t\tthat plague the English roads. I navigate and Lynda sits between\n\t\t\tus, trying to get a glimpse of the English countryside as it\n\t\t\tflashes by. Kathie, Owen and George are in the back with the\n\t\t\tkit. Arranged on a big pile of cushions they cope well with life\n\t\t\tas freight until, somewhere east of Newmarket, the sun goes down.\n\t\t\tThen they go very quiet.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAbout ten miles outside Norwich - perhaps twenty miles from our destination -\n\t\t\tthere is a faintly desperate rapping on the wall that divides the freight from the front. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Where are we?\" cries an audibly anxious Owen.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI reassure him that we are not far from our target, and indeed\n\t\t\tsoon we are pulling up in the snow-covered yard of an enormous\n\t\t\told wooden mill perched over a river in a remote Norfolk backwater,\n\t\t\twhich turns out, as fate would have it, to be only three or four\n\t\t\tmiles from the place where in another life I recorded \n\t\t\t\"Cult of the Basement\"\n\t\t\tand \"Condition Blue\".\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe freight is released gratefully from the back of the Transit\n\t\t\tand we all waddle into the hotel's smart and attractive bar to warm up. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe are greeted warmly and hospitably by the gentleman who booked\n\t\t\tus, but there is a detectable note of - shall we say - flakiness\n\t\t\tin the air. When the hard-bitten touring engine meets the well-intentioned\n\t\t\tbut inexperienced amateur odd little things like securing one's\n\t\t\troom or a mat for the drum kit can become the source of unexpected\n\t\t\tdilemmas, which can lead to confusion, even frustration. Nonetheless,\n\t\t\twith the invaluable help of our support band, Tumbling Dice,\n\t\t\twe get everything sorted and zip through an encouraging soundcheck,\n\t\t\twhich we complete just in time for dinner.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOur table is huge and round. Somebody remarks that it's all a bit Arthurian.\n\t\t\t\"Yes,\"\n\t\t\tsays Owen, \n\t\t\t\"And I know who King Arthur is.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHe is looking across the table directly at George.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA top dinner ensues. The hotel clearly has a fine chef and we\n\t\t\tdine on all manner of good things, including the quite possibly\n\t\t\tthe best chips to be had outside of Belgium. As we finish up,\n\t\t\tthe dining room begins to fill with wholesome-looking families\n\t\t\tgathered in their best togs for a festive blow-out. It occurs\n\t\t\tto me that this might be a good time for\n\t\t\tthe scary musicians to make themselves scarce, so I leg it up\n\t\t\tto my room and set about devising a list of tunes for tonight's show. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt soon dawns on me that it would be stupid for me to try and\n\t\t\tassemble a set list without consultation with the rest of the\n\t\t\tband, so I find myself obliged to go looking for them back down\n\t\t\tin the dining room. As I arrive I find Steve, Lynda, Anne and\n\t\t\tBaerbel sitting at a beautifully set table with George and bottle\n\t\t\tof Champagne. It immediately becomes clear that it is George\n\t\t\twho has ordered the Champagne. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMax and I slip away for a moment and construct a set list, which,\n\t\t\twe imagine fondly, will cause all manner of consternation among\n\t\t\tthe rest of the band. We are wrong. They all think it's fine, the mad bastards.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHere it is:<br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Mr. Odd] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/mr_odd.html\">Mr. Odd</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Mr. Odd]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:She's On Drugs] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/shes_on_drugs.html\">She's On Drugs</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:She's On Drugs]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Sweet Jane] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Sweet Jane</i>\n\t<span class=\"song_author\">(Lou Reed)</span>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Sweet Jane]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Who Loves You Now?] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/who_loves_you_now.html\">Who Loves You Now?</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Who Loves You Now?]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Come On\\, Marie] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/come_on_marie.html\">Come On\\, Marie</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Come On\\, Marie]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Diamorphine] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/diamorphine.html\">Diamorphine</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Diamorphine]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Rain] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/rain.html\">Rain</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Rain]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Soul Happy Hour] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/soul_happy_hour.html\">Soul Happy Hour</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Soul Happy Hour]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/caroline_wheeler.html\">Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present]:END --><p>\n\t\t\tmidnight Champagne, snogging and shouting break<p>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Come\\, Friendly Spacemen] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Come\\, Friendly Spacemen</i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Come\\, Friendly Spacemen]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i>Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)</i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Take The Skinheads Bowling (Camper Van Beethoven)]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Niagara] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/niagara.html\">Niagara</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Niagara]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Sister Death] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/sister_death.html\">Sister Death</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Sister Death]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Girlfriend] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/girlfriend.html\">Girlfriend</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Girlfriend]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Partytime] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/partytime.html\">Partytime</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Partytime]:END --><br>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Zombie Love] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/zombie_love.html\">Zombie Love</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Zombie Love]:END -->\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNow, the sensitive reader will have noticed that we are talking\n\t\t\tabout a New Year's Eve gig here, and it is fair to say that there was some considerable\n\t\t\tdebate about whether the band should include the Twin Towers\n\t\t\tOf Misery And Despair (<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Diamorphine] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/diamorphine.html\">Diamorphine</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Diamorphine]:END --> and <!-- BEG:expanded_from:[song:Sister Death] -->\n\t<span class='song'>\n\t<i><a href=\"/lyrics/sister_death.html\">Sister Death</a></i>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[song:Sister Death]:END -->) in the set tonight.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis debate ended up with everyone in the band saying \n\t\t\t\"Naaah\".. fuck..\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt about 10:00pm Tumbling Dice take the stage. A duo with backing\n\t\t\ttracks of their own devising, they play a brilliant party set\n\t\t\tof covers from the songbooks of The Beatles and The Stones, with\n\t\t\ttunes by The Kinks and The Small Faces thrown in for good measure.\n\t\t\tThey even do a Status Quo number! During this last I catch Claire\n\t\t\tout doing That Seventies Dance: you know, the one with the hands\n\t\t\ton the hips and the weird rhythmic spastic twitching at the waist.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"I bet they still dance like that round here,\"\n\t\t\tI tell her.\n\t\t\tThen I turn around and see a local couple about ten feet away - doing exactly that!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhile the dice are tumbling I also note that George, who generally\n\t\t\tnever drinks, is well on his way. He is shaking his head to the\n\t\t\tsixties sounds like there is no tomorrow. I have never seen George\n\t\t\trock so hard.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOur set list is planned to break for the midnight shenanigans.\n\t\t\tWe refuse to learn \"Auld Lang Syne\"\n\t\t\tand we don't want to ruin people's New Year party, so we have resolved to stop awhile for kissing\n\t\t\tand shouting at the auspicious hour. This entails our starting\n\t\t\tat exactly 11:10pm. We finally make it onstage to start at 11:18pm,\n\t\t\tbut no matter \n\t\t\twe have found a clock that can be seen from the stage, so we\n\t\t\tfondly imagine that we are in control.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs we take the stage I essay a short speech to explain to the\n\t\t\tfew natives gathered what exactly the fuck is liable to be going\n\t\t\ton. As you probably know, the JBC only generally play in places\n\t\t\twhere people want to see them. (It makes life so much more pleasant\n\t\t\tfor band and punters alike, we feel.)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis is clearly not the case tonight, so I give a little spiel\n\t\t\tabout how..  well, you know how all the bands say they're different..\n\t\t\twell, we really are different because different.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYeah, nice one, Pat.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFrom the first number it's clear that the improvised sound system and the under-rehearsed\n\t\t\tJBC are both working as well as they possibly could. Within a\n\t\t\tcouple of tunes dancing has broken out. A couple of tunes later\n\t\t\tI look up to see George leaping two-footed into the air. A few\n\t\t\tsongs down the road and Owen's floor tom-tom collapses on top of his pint, shattering the\n\t\t\tglass and scattering beer everywhere. He mends the drum, sorts\n\t\t\tout a new pint and puts it back down. A few minutes later the\n\t\t\tdrum collapses again, with more shattered glass and squandered\n\t\t\tbeer. But we are having fun.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe arrive at the first Tower Of Misery And Despair.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDiamorphine goes off like a big mental bomb.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe cruise through some pop songs and a particularly sociopathic\n\t\t\tWheeler and make it to the midnight break without problems.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tChampagne is opened. Hugs and kisses all round. Everybody has\n\t\t\tmade it into 2002. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe pick up again some ten minutes down the road with a nicely\n\t\t\tpaced Spacemen\n\t\t\tand reel on through the rest of our show. People, God bless\n\t\t\tthem, are going mental. Not even Sister Death can stop them.\n\t\t\t(My excuse goes along the lines of: \n\t\t\t\"Well, you can't have a dance without a waltz, boys and girls, now can you?\"\n\t\t\tTo my astonishment, I get away with it.)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe finish with a typically vile rendition of \n\t\t\tZombie Love, then encore with Roadrunner.\n\t\t\tBy the end of it I am barking like a big stupid dog.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEveryone is astoundingly kind about our show. While Tumbling\n\t\t\tDice return to play a couple more top party tunes we chill the\n\t\t\tfuck out with bottles of Champagne and the rest. A top soul DJ\n\t\t\ttakes over and the party goes on until about 4:00am, by which\n\t\t\ttime, thoroughly mashed, Kathie, George and I retire to our room\n\t\t\twith one final bottle of Champagne and a bunch of Rizlas.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe awake the following day to beautiful winter sun on the river\n\t\t\tbeneath our window.

We came on stage, all neatly soundchecked, only to discover that the pad\n\t\t\ton the CD backing track was a whole semitone out with all the guitars! Now,\n\t\t\tI had just tuned the guitars (4 of 'em!), so I knew it wasn't that. What it\n\t\t\twas was that the house CD player was one of those DJ jobs with varispeed.\n\t\t\tSome prannet had obviously leaned on the varispeed button at some point,\n\t\t\tthrusting Wilson into the Omniverse. A quick appeal from the stage brought\n\t\t\tthe house soundman hurtling across the dancefloor to \"reset devices\" and we\n\t\t\tcarried on happily.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t2. Having broken a string on my telecaster, I was delighted to see it\n\t\t\treappear, fully strung-up, on my guitar stand. I picked it up for the start\n\t\t\tof \"Secret Government\" only to discover that it was in regular EADGBE\n\t\t\ttuning...which was odd, as it was supposed to be in an open D tuning. I had\n\t\t\tto spend the first verse of the sing dragging the tuning back. Thank God for\n\t\t\tsilent tuners! Anyway, it all went smoothly enough and we carried on without\n\t\t\tincident.

Accordingly, Wilson took the stage about ten minutes\n\t\t\tbefore our ludicrous UK licensing laws closed the bar and about ten minutes mafter a steaming performance from the\n\t\t\tyoung and very talented Capdown.

Once again the cheeky music hall eccentrics\n\t\t\tdemonstrated their complete inability to come to terms with the\n\t\t\tSpace/Time continuum by performing with a line-up that blatently\n\t\t\tflouted the very principles of quantum physics as they are understood\n\t\t\ttoday.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Conspiracy, represented on this occasion by ringleaders Pat\n\t\t\tFish and Max Eider, began the evening in August 1982, playing\n\t\t\ta selection of their cult songs from their first album, \"Bath\n\t\t\tOf Bacon\" recorded in the year of the Falklands War. But this\n\t\t\twas no simple effort at reviving a lost era of indie-pop mediocrity.\n\t\t\tDeprived of his usual effects unit (whose power supply he had\n\t\t\tleft back in Lodon), Eider actually managed to recreate his exact\n\t\t\tsound from a concert in the upstairs room of a quaint London\n\t\t\tpub style venue in November 1982, while Fish's inept caterwaulings\n\t\t\tand scratchy amateurish strumming had listeners longing for the\n\t\t\tDJ to play some Bronski Beat or fine Young Cannibals.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAmid rumours that members of talented doom-rockers Bauhaus were\n\t\t\tin attendance (it turned out to be the head of the Love & Rockets\n\t\t\tfan club), the dentally-challenged Fish and the frankly alarming\n\t\t\tEider played through a selection of ancient garbage before throwing\n\t\t\tthe audience a curve ball with the inclusion of the song \"Whaddya?\",\n\t\t\trecorded long after Eider left the group.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOwing the the spectacularly shakey performance of the tune, many\n\t\t\tfailed to notice that the eclectic duo had departed from the\n\t\t\tnorms of reality and were in fact engaged in an assault on the\n\t\t\tvery fabric of the universe itself.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tExperts are undecided on how exactly the British fops were able\n\t\t\tto effect their ultimately nightmarish bending of time and space,\n\t\t\tbut Doktor Herbert Pruegler of the Berlin Institute of Home Economics\n\t\t\tbelieves that an apparently endless rendition of the song \"Sister\n\t\t\tDeath\", followed by a period of some five minutes during which\n\t\t\tthe guitar-toting deviants played only the chord of D Major,\n\t\t\tmay have had the effect of temporarily bringing the passing of\n\t\t\ttime to a standstill. At any rate, after a moment of collective\n\t\t\tamnesia, or \"lost time\" as X-philes might have it, the audience\n\t\t\tbecame aware that Eider and Fish had been joined onstage by guitarist/producer\n\t\t\tRichard \"Lenin\" Formby. The traditional rock \"old pals\" act had\n\t\t\tan bizarre twist, however: Eider had left the band before <!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Richard Formby] -->\n\t<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/richard_formby.html\">Richard Formby</a>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[person:Richard Formby]:END -->\n\t\t\tever joined, and Formby had already disappeared from the JBC\n\t\t\tcircle before Eider ever re-joined. Long-term students of forteana\n\t\t\twill recall a similar incident in 1995 when Eider was supposedly\n\t\t\tspotted on stage in London alongside\n\t\t\t<a href=\"/people/peter_crouch.html\">Peter \"Something Simple\n\t\t\tFor The Weekend\" Crouch</a>, the JBC guitarist who infamously became\n\t\t\tan air hostess in 1993 before going on to Premier League success\n\t\t\twith the Aston Villa soccer club.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOwing to the practical difficulties of warping the space/time\n\t\t\tcontinuum in such an outrageous fashion, the dandyish and heavily\n\t\t\tmoustachioed Formby experienced a few problems with his equipment\n\t\t\tbefore starting to play. It soon became clear that the Conspiracy's\n\t\t\tdisrespect for the laws of physics was matched only by its cavalier\n\t\t\tattitude towards its own material: for \"Mister Odd\" Eider found\n\t\t\thimself laying down the rhythmic chord backing alone, while Fish\n\t\t\tand Formby insisted on both playing the same guitar solo simultaneously.\n\t\t\tProfessor Haskins of the University of Hawaii suspects that this\n\t\t\tmight have been a device to \"fix\" the astonishing temporo-historical\n\t\t\twormhole which they had constructed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe performance continued with a rendition of \"Girl-Go\" from\n\t\t\t1990's album \"Cult of Debasement\" whereon Eider and Formby fought\n\t\t\tan aerial dogfight reminiscent of the later years of the first\n\t\t\tWorld War. Towards the end of the version all pretence of chord\n\t\t\tstructure was abandoned in favour of a heinous squalling, droning\n\t\t\trow. An ensuing version of the brutalist paean to necrophilia\n\t\t\t\"Zombie Love\" saw the quaint Brits returning to the 14th Century,\n\t\t\treproducing a chillingly accurate sonic portrayal of the Black\n\t\t\tDeath that decimated the audiences - sorry, population - of Mediaeval\n\t\t\tEurope.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter noisy demands from the audience to be returned to the 21st\n\t\t\tCentury forthwith, Eider and Fish returned to the stage for a\n\t\t\tvaledictory version of \"Drink\" before retiring to a secret laboratory\n\t\t\tfor debriefing and refreshment. The majority of the stunned listeners\n\t\t\tleft the venue to find themselves returned to the early 21st\n\t\t\tCentury, but a small number remain stranded in a dark and evil\n\t\t\tplace somewhere between 1983 and 1993 with no obvious means of\n\t\t\tegress. Emergency services are doing as much as they can, but\n\t\t\tsay that they are in urgent need of parapsychological assistance\n\t\t\tfrom experts in St. Petersburg last seen in 1991. President Tony\n\t\t\tBlur has appealed for information, while Minister of the Interior\n\t\t\tDavid Blunkett has sworn to outlaw any further interference with\n\t\t\tthe fabric of space and time by pot-smoking oddballs.

Curt was\n\t\t\taway in a foreign land on special familial business. Steve Ward did the sound and Johnny P the lights.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Racehorse bar stages musical acts every Sunday. Some nights you barely notice they are there, even though there are\n\t\t\tonly about 15 drinkers in the bar. Some acts do pull in a small crowd of mates. And that's what we'd normally expect. All\n\t\t\tright, we're older, so we know a few more mates. We put on some lights, try to do a decent sound, we get a few people in\n\t\t\tand hopefully they enjoy it. We get paid, but we spend that on getting in a good pa and lights.\n\t\t\tLast night when Johnny P and I came in from dinner, the place was fecking heaving.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMC Bot was enjoying his birthday, and to please him we put The Streets on the pa about 15 minutes before we went on, a move\n\t\t\tof staggering arrogance and over-confidence, the sort of move that really filled me with karma terror. The sort of thing we\n\t\t\tdo all the fecking time, to be honest. Some kids waiting to see the group actually split when The Streets came on. At the\n\t\t\tback of the room a small knot of middle-aged men were shouting along and making clenched-fist gestures in a display more\n\t\t\tsuited to men half their age, to whom such things are supposed still to matter.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs we took tthe stage I saw that Bot was toting some manner of ray gun. It turned out to fire bubbles. Stevie Ward brought\n\t\t\tup my vocal mic just in time to catch me wailing \"Sharon! Shaaaarrrroooooon!\" But I mean, really. Here we are, the princes\n\t\t\tand princess of the feckin' heart of darkness, and he's letting off fecking bubbles. What's evil about feckin' bubbles?\n\t\t\tSHAAARROOOOOOON!!!!!!!!\n\t\t\tQuality People kicked in like a bomb hitting the place, more or less. By the end the punters were cheering. Punters do not\n\t\t\tcheer in the Racehorse bar of a Sunday night. It doesn't happen. But these punters were cheering. \"Happy Birthday, Bot!\"\n\t\t\tcried Bot, instantly establishing the catch-phrase of the night. He had also, by now, fully mastered the technique of\n\t\t\twringing as much feedback from his radio mic as humanly possible. For the rest of the night, more on stage than among the\n\t\t\tpunters, it was like the fecking Mary Chain up there. WHOOOOOOOO- WHOOP- WHHHHEEEEEUUUUURRRRRRGGGGHHHHSSSSSSSZTSST...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe rest of the sound was pretty hard, though. Misery was positively subsonic. Russ got a rake of cavernous reverb on his\n\t\t\tcongas for Hippy Shit. We did the best \"Trouble Every Day\" since the Mothers stopped doing it. Bot was delivered of drinks\n\t\t\tfrom the crowd throughout and only did a Dooj on my FX pedals once. Hey, it was his birthday. Once he has the paperwork\n\t\t\tfor. We got away with two brand new tunes. Good old crowd, good old night, way beyond our expectations. And those of Pete\n\t\t\tthe Landlord, I would imagine. He must have made a pile of money on the bar. Many of the people in his bar were Quite Drunk\n\t\t\tat the end of the evening.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe headed back to Shakespeare Villas, currently more like Shakespeare International House Of Leaves, where a party\n\t\t\tdeveloped involving the band, plus members of Saab 77 and The Echo Chamber down from Leeds, P-Hex (Stevie G's enormous funk\n\t\t\tband), The Sheep Thieves and Hinterhoff Records. Becks and Budvar were drunk, as was Scott the boy detective. We closed at\n\t\t\tabout 4:30 am. Not bad for a Sunday night at the local.

I know that\n\t\t\tthis might not seem too impressive to our overseas readers, but\n\t\t\tin the UK this is still something rare and precious. It is with\n\t\t\tgreat satisfaction that the JBC and their friends leave the gig,\n\t\t\twalk a couple of hundred yards up the street and settle down\n\t\t\tfor a civilised post-concert drink. Not, it has to be said, all\n\t\t\tthat civilised: those who were there just minutes before we arrived\n\t\t\twere witness to a massive barroom brawl. Still, it has all blown\n\t\t\tover by the time we make it in, so no problems there. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm chatting to Steve from Wilson when Lynda appears and asks if\n\t\t\tthey have Jaegermeister here. I am forced to say that they don't,\n\t\t\tand my mind turns to trying to come up with an equally frightening\n\t\t\tand viscous local liqueur. I settle on Drambuie. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tLong ago, back before Air Rage had been invented, I found myself\n\t\t\t\"doing\"\n\t\t\tDrambuies with a young actor on a flight back from Los Angeles.\n\t\t\tI found myself moved to tell a joke \n\t\t\tone whose punch line must of necessity be screamed out at top\n\t\t\tvolume. Owing largely to the Drambuies I had failed to notice\n\t\t\tthat I was delivering this punch line right in the middle of\n\t\t\tthe transatlantic night, with everybody else on the plane fast\n\t\t\tasleep. A slightly panicky waitress \n\t\t\t- oh, so sorry, - Flight Attendant\n\t\t\tsoon brought home to me what I had just done. I suppose if it\n\t\t\thad happened this year I would have ended up sharing a cell with\n\t\t\tcelebrated joghurt-slosher Peter Buck.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI haven't had a lot of Drambuie since that incident, \n\t\t\tbut I remember it with affection. Heaven knows why: one mouthful\n\t\t\tand we are all agreed that it's revolting stuff!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe drink until closing time, and then it's back to JBC Central for a party.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYes, we have a show tomorrow.

The day began with a phone call booking\n\t\t\t\t the band for a second gig in Belgium...rock! We got on the road\n\t\t\t\t at a fairly reasonable hour, Baerbel kissed us all good luck,\n\t\t\t\t and we were on our way.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tEveryone was still a bit weary from the night before, not to\n\t\t\t\t mention getting up at an unGodly hour to watch football. The\n\t\t\t\t drive was long, but we reached N&uuml;remberg in about 6 hours or\n\t\t\t\t so. The initial plan was to go straight on to Munich, but Pat's\n\t\t\t\t judgment at N&uuml;remberg  (pun intended) was to stay the night and\n\t\t\t\t pick up the additional two hours or so the next day.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hotel we stayed at was French, and had all of the modern\n\t\t\t\t conveniences of a plastic room with a mattress on the floor.\n\t\t\t\t Indeed, we got onto the elevator, which promptly trapped us until\n\t\t\t\t Owen smartly came to look for us. Good thing, too...for we know\n\t\t\t\t what happens when you leave a Fish too long in an elevator (don't\n\t\t\t\t we?)...Also, no phones in the room (hence, no internet connection,\n\t\t\t\t hence no report...QED)\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tI enjoyed a much needed shower and a good night's sleep, and\n\t\t\t\t in the morning, we had breakfast outside a small cafe. We again\n\t\t\t\t took to the autobahn, arriving in Munich mid-afternoon.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter setting up, the band did a rehearsal (since they hadn't\n\t\t\t\t had one...even prior to the Hamburg gig) and really tightened\n\t\t\t\t up. By soundcheck they were in the groove, and well looking forward\n\t\t\t\t to the show.\n\t\t\t   <p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe club owner prepared dinner for all, after which I went for\n\t\t\t\t a stroll. Former JBC alum Peter 'No Show' Crouch turned up, to\n\t\t\t\t everyone's delight. I ran merchandise before and after the show,\n\t\t\t\t and once again got to be 'JBC answer man', a job I am uniquely\n\t\t\t\t suited for. Pat decided that I was in charge of 'Public relations',\n\t\t\t\t and was pleased with the number of CDs that sold...so I am earning\n\t\t\t\t my keep.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe show itself was great: a nice club, a good audience, and\n\t\t\t\t the band was keen to play. Crouchy even got up (after a chant\n\t\t\t\t of 'Crou-chy, Crou-chy') and played on 'Zombie Love'. Three or\n\t\t\t\t four of the people that I sold CDs to hadn't heard of the band\n\t\t\t\t before, so that itself speaks to the performance.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tTonight we are all flopping in one big room over the club...\n\t\t\t\t Beds strewn about the floor, slumber party style. In the morning,\n\t\t\t\t the band plans to go to the pub to watch more football. (The\n\t\t\t\t good thing about not being into sports is, you get to sleep in.)\n\t\t\t\t Then we make our way back to Nuremburg for the show there. No\n\t\t\t\t cheap French hotel tomorrow though, an old friend of Owen's will\n\t\t\t\t be putting us up.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tSo to bed, to dream of windmills off the autobahn and breakfast\n\t\t\t\t strudel.

I sang Owen the ComedySportz\n\t\t\t\t birthday song, which he enjoyed (I guess if you've never heard\n\t\t\t\t it before, it's still funny). We watched football (Italy vs.\n\t\t\t\t South Korea) which was (apparently) the most exciting game of\n\t\t\t\t the cup thus far (overtime, with Korea pulling it out with a\n\t\t\t\t beautiful header in the final minutes).

Another outdoor show...more punters, and even more\n\t\t\t\t passersby. This was a two-set deal, and the first set, found\n\t\t\t\t Pat a bit reserved. He was disconcerted by the huge number of\n\t\t\t\t people, yet the mere smattering of applause. We informed him\n\t\t\t\t that everyone was drinking, and therefore, no one had hands free\n\t\t\t\t to clap.

Beers were being dropped in favor\n\t\t\t\t of clapping and cheering. This was the sound of the band having\n\t\t\t\t fun, and Pat in particular going positively MENTAL. Needless\n\t\t\t\t to say, the band went after the post-show festivities with a\n\t\t\t\t similar fervor to that of the show itself.

The first thing we notice on arriving at the Roadmender is that we now have a dressing room, with our name on the door and a crate of beers inside it. When Brian, our social secretary, appears we have all we need in this small and airless HQ of ours. Steve Ward is here to mix us tonight, and that means that we have a fine and easy soundcheck. Wilson in the comfort zone.\n\t\t\tStepping out to the bar I find Simon Mawby (Woodentops guitarist) and June Miles-Kingston (drummer to Fun Boy Three and other gentry). Pleased as I am to see them here, I can't help wondering what the man once known as Cardinal Mawb will make of all this.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI am still in the bar when I hear the sounds of The Streets. Time to head for the dressing room and get ready, then...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe go on at about 8:30. The main hall of the Roadmender is about two thirds full. The vast majority of the audience is staggeringly young. Well, stand by to be screamed at by people the age of your parents, The Kids...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCurtis is in Amsterdam for his brother's stag night, the lucky dog, so it falls to me to do a bit of avant-gardening with my delay pedal. Swooshie-wooshie it goes as Quality People stutters into life. Bang thump crunch goes the group as MC Bot emerges, statuesque, all in red, still clutching that bloody bullhorn thing and looking for a rumble. We go tearing through our first tune as the room fills up. They're hanging over the barriers at the front and the heads are beginning to shake.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYellow Pages (as we're still calling it) is feeling fully-formed now and with a superb sound onstage and off we are able to deliver it in fine style. Then a fiery Burn Hollywood Burn (well, it would be, wouldn't it?) gets things really going.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHippy Shit next, with Bot and me working overtime in the vocal department. Russell's solo spot is swamped in white noise, which may have something to do with me. Whatever, the house is rocked. A little chill with Istanbul Connection, then Every Saturday Night, another new song that's found its feet. I find myself wondering what Simon must be thinking. It can't possibly be what he was expecting.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe rip up Play It All Night Long, then throw Critters at them. It's explosive. People are standing on the PA columns. Critters crashes into great wall of controlled feedback before the nagging Dark Agenda riff emerges. Another top version: the end section sees everybody going Edgar Wallace mental, Bot booming out New Order lyrics over the chaos. The punters erupt and I leave the stage to the sound of Bot haranguing them about I know not what. And it's no good asking him what he was on about, coz he can't remember! Truly the best set we have yet delivered: totally convincing sound, furious performance, baying punters. Just what you want.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter a few minutes chilling back in the dressing room we check Skindred. Boy, are they loud! It's the rock/dub thing, as you might expect from a band that was formed from the ashes of Dub War. Rage Against The Machine might be a suitable point of reference. They are a top live band and go down well, teasing the audience before returning for a well-earned encore. Nice geezers too. They're Welsh, you know.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe pack up our kit and have another brief chat with Simon and June before it is time for another Wilson novelty - getting paid!

This fairly charmless council-sponsored venue has played host to the likes of Paul Weller, The Manic Street Preachers, Primal Scream and The Damned. Back in the day it was the local port of call for Spacemen 3, the Perfect Disaster and, yes, the JBC. More recently, after a multi-million pound facelift, it has been the venue for some top performances from Culture, Ernest Ranglin, Julian Cope and the mighty Tuvan ensemble Yat-Kha. Gregory Isaacs was here too recently, but I wasn't na&iuml;ve enough to think that my promise of a place on the  guest list would work, so I missed that one.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOur date is not being promoted by the club itself. It is the work of an organisation called \"The Voice\", which appears to be a faintly educational affair, run by an amiable Scouse hobbit called Bill. This shameless optimist has booked no fewer than six acts for this evening's entertainment. Wilson are to headline on the main stage. The other groups are largely unknown to our posse. Some of them are made up entirely of early teens, so we assume that these must represent Bill's educational constituency.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhatever, this marks a definite \"step up\" in Wilson's local profile, and we have been working hard to make it a good one. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFirst, however, there is the small matter of retrieving Kathy Schaer from the United States, where she has been visiting her family. At about one o'clock I receive a phone call from Kath. She is back in the country (hooray!), but there is a snag. Somebody has just thrown himself onto the railway line and all the trains back to Northampton have stopped. Honestly, it's just self-self-self for some people, isn't it?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFortunately enough, the railways sort themselves out for once and by five o'clock Kath is back in NN1 and ready to rumble. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tStevie G and I are the first to arrive at the venue, where we meet James, our soundman for the night. As I go to shake his hand, he declares: \"You're famous!\"\n\t\t\tIt turns out that he has heard endless reports about Stranger Tractors from the old Tractors didgeridoo player, Bolly, who went on to work as the bar manager at the venue. James also tells us to expect no more than a line-check before playing. Gently, calmly, firmly I explain to him that if he wants a full bill tonight, Wilson will be doing a full sound check. The message is received and, it would appear, understood.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNo sooner have we established this than Kath arrives at the venue, closely followed by Agent Cooper. While James organises a soundcheck for a band called Sophomore (who have a rather more...uh...traditional line-up than Wilson), we head for the car park to enjoy the balmy evening with some special cigarettes. We have not been there long before our attention is drawn to a car on the busy main road beneath us, which is emitting odd electronic squawks and bleeps. Somebody in the car has some kind of gimmicky loud-hailer device, which they are using to full effect down there in the Friday evening traffic. \"Nutter\", we conclude.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA few moments later we hear the strange noises again. They turn out to be issuing from MC Bot, who is hanging out of the window of Curtis' car clutching a brightly coloured bullhorn. The party is about to kick off.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn the corner of the car park we gather around Russ' motor, skinning up, hanging out and playing The Streets at maximum volume: as intimidating a gang of middle-aged sociopaths as you could hope to avoid. The other groups are arriving by now. Some of them are so young that they are being delivered in cars by fond fathers, who actually look about the right age to join Wilson. There is much amusement as one of the dads manhandles a huge speaker cabinet across the car park while The Streets chant \"Let's push things forward!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA soundcheck is arranged and runs smoothly enough. I find myself more or less alone stage right. This gives me two major advantages: (i) I have plenty of space in which to operate, and (ii) I can crank my amp as loud as I want without putting anybody off their stroke. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSoundcheck completed, MC Bot and Russ set out to find the dressing room, returning minutes later to advise us that there are to be no dressing rooms tonight. Given that the contract for tonight offers no rider, no guest list, no guaranteed wages and no dressing room, I wonder what exactly was the point of asking me to sign it. It's not as though there was anything on offer to sign for, after all. Still, we are not despondent. We smoke up and split up, heading off to feed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt is about half past seven as I leave the venue. I am astonished to see dozens and dozens of teens flooding into the front bar. Later, my pal's daughter will ask me \"What are all these children doing here?\" Right now, though, I am just glad to see that there is going to be an audience. (It later turns out that there were about 280 paying punters.)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn my return from having a little dinner in The Fish, I am unable to find any of the band at the venue. Eventually I find Curtis and Stevie G. They have simply gone ahead and commandeered a dressing room regardless. Also in the dressing room is a harassed-looking gentleman in a suit, who, Curt tells me, is here to film the show. After a brief consultation with the venue staff he is allowed access to the balcony, where he spends the rest of the evening with his fingers in his ears.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAlso in the area are Jonny Mattock from Lupine Howl and Mark Refoy, freshly returned from his world tour playing guitar for the Pet Shop Boys. It's his first chance to catch Wilson live and we are pleased to see him.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI watch a little bit of Sophomore; very strong traditional British \"indie\" played very loud indeed, with much head-shaking down in the front row of the punters. Very much Not My Thing, but expertly delivered and rightly popular with the youngsters. Passing into the front bar I see another band, a kind of rustic Oasis, fronted by a strangely-shaped young singer with even stranger sideburns. I have no idea what they were called, but they were quite entertaining all the same.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen it is time for the Bad Muthafuckas. After a brief introduction from Bill we go full-tilt into \"Quality People\" and boy, is it loud! There is a young man down the front lying flat-out on the floor. James the soundman sees him and comes rushing over, alarmed and ready to help. As he reaches the casualty, the boy just gets up, shrugs and walks away. Weird. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe set rumbles on. We play well and make maximum use of the available space. At one point I look up to see Curtis, miles away from his instrument and his microphone, just leaping about in the middle of the stage. Bot is switching between his mic and his bullhorn according to some strange inner Bot Logic. Despite being jet-lagged to the point of utter bewilderment, Kath lays down huge basslines that enter your body through your feet. After the show Stevie G and I agree that we have never cranked our amps so loud.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe set runs: Quality People; Yellow Pages; Burn Hollywood Burn; Hippy Shit (particularly rocking version tonight); Istanbul Connection; Play It All Night Long; Every Saturday Night; Critters; Dark Agenda. It is well received and, according to Kath McGinty, about the same volume as a jumbo jet taking off indoors. We have taken on the Roadmender and pulled it off.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter the show a member of the Roadmender staff approaches us and asks us to support a band called Skindread on Saturday 12th October. Seeing this as our \"wages\" for the night, we say yes. So that was all worthwhile, then.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn the other hand, as we leave the stage we discover that the bar has closed. This after we had been told that it would stay open until at least one o'clock. We resolve to pack up and head for the nearby Charles Bradlaugh, which stays open until one and which has recently taken to serving Pilsner Urquell. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn the way out I find Bill being menaced by some tiny youths. Despite presumably having had the same mealy-mouthed contract as ourselves, they are demanding to be paid. Things turn comically ugly as one tiny youth advises Bill that he is going to set the \"Music Union\" (sic) onto poor Bill. This does seem a touch unlikely. If this tiny youth is in the Musicians' Union, then I am Marie of Romania. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe pass a pleasant hour or so in the Bradlaugh before taking off. Kath is going home for some long-overdue rest. Russ and Curt also head for home. The rest of us have a brief after-show back at Shakespeare Mansions. Mindful of our gig tomorrow, we turn in around four o'clock."},{"gigtext_id":434,"datetime":"2002-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"We didn't advertise it coz it was essentially a birthday party for an expat Northamptonian."},{"gigtext_id":435,"datetime":"2002-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Well, the weekend was mental. As you know, we did the Roadmender on Friday night.\n\t\t\t\tWhat you probably didn't know about was the Wilson Vietnam trip\n\t\t\t\tto Wales yesterday. We didn't advertise it coz it was essentially a\n\t\t\t\tbirthday party for an expat Northamptonian. Plus nobody would tell us\n\t\t\t\tthe name of the farm where it was taking place! Still, we found the\n\t\t\t\tfecker and rocked the shed fully. Full reports (featuring The Face O' Death) to follow.\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Saturday 21st September - BUILTH WELLS </h1>\n\tIt is eleven thirty on a beautiful, sunny Saturday morning in the car park of the Racehorse. Members of Wilson and P-Hex are gathering, ready for the 150 mile trip to Builth Wells in the heart of Wales. Cars are filled with equipment as people sip odd non-alcoholic drinks. Kathie McGinty and I are travelling in our Fiat Uno with a bunch of equipment. Russ is taking Kath Schaer, Curtis and Bot are travelling with Steve Davies, Lindsay Spence (the singer from P-Hex) and Nathan from Junior Loaded in a car dubbed \"The Zoo\", and Stevie G is travelling with P-Hex. At about midday the first car of the convoy sets off.\n\t<p>\n\tWe are headed for a farm which Alan Moore bought back in the Nineties, which has been home to his pal Fred Ryan for several years now. Today is the occasion of Fred's fiftieth birthday and a massive party has been planned. Apart from the groups, there are several dozen Northampton people heading west today.\n\t<p>\n\tThoughtfully, nobody has been told the name of the farm in question. Our instructions are to find a bar in Builth called The White Hart and ask for \"Fred's farm\". Fortunately enough, P-Hex have done this gig before, so we still entertain hopes of finding the place.\n\t<p>\n\tOnce we get west of Worcester the roads grow narrow and the houses more ancient and picturesque. Every other village gets me going \"Oh, eccentric life here, isn't it?\" in the manner of Turkish George. It is barely recognisable as the same country as Northampton. Just west of a place called Kington we pass through an intimidating gorge into Welsh Wales. Well, at least now it really is a different country. \n\t<p>\n\tThe first thing we see as we cross the River Wye into Builth is Kath and her boyfriend Jay standing outside our hotel. The Lion Hotel boasts a George Best bar and a Lady Diana restaurant, as well as a splendid African Grey parrot who shouts \"Wanker!\" We check into our rooms, which are much more comfortable than the dilapidated public areas of the hotel would suggest. Ours has a fantasticview out over the river. We stroll up the picturesque main street to the White Hart for directions and a pint, then hit the local supermarket for supplies. On our way out of the supermarket we are passed by The Zoo, with Bot hanging out of the window, making maximum use of his bullhorn: \"Wilson in the area! Pat Fish in the area!\" he broadcasts as the car disappears up the high street, \"Whoop! Squawk! Bleep!\"\n\t<p>\n\tThe farm is not easy to find, and we make one or two false landings among bewildered locals before finally locating our objective at the end of an obscure and lengthy country lane. We pull into the parking and camping field just in time to see the local Police helicopter circling overhead, attracting all kinds of \n\tlong-distance abuse. \n\t<p>\n\tThe Zoo is promptly converted into a giant ghetto blaster and The Streets are on once again. People are wandering about grinning and greeting as NN1 comes to the deep countryside. Tents are going up, dogs are chasing sticks and children are getting dressed up in ludicrous costumes. One small boy of about eight is wearing a push-up bra and make-up. More alarmingly, another tiny is sporting a terrifying skull mask, which leads to his immediately being dubbed The Face Of Death. \n\t<p>\n\tAlmost immediately The Face Of Death and MC Bot become entangled in a mortal struggle. The tiny demon follows Bot everywhere like some superhero's sidekick gone horribly wrong, and it is not long before things get gnarly. One small child is overheard telling his mother: \"This man is chasing us, like, \n\twell badly!\" \n\t<p>\n\tLater, alarmingly, other, adult Faces Of Death turn up. Fortunately they do not seek retribution from our singer. In addition, there are nuns, pirates, monks and a man in a fez with what I can only describe as two faces. \"Now that,\" I tell him, \"Is just plain scary.\" Though not, perhaps, as scary as the old friend of Curtis who has turned up with a full-size, razor-sharp Samurai sword.\n\t<p>\n\tCurtis himself rapidly becomes a casualty of the fancy dress tendency. After being on site for only ten minutes he re-appears with his baldy head painted red and blue. Since this has been accomplished using car spray paint, he remains something of an odd apparition for the rest of the weekend. \n\t<p>\n\tThe farm itself is made up of three buildings: one entirely residential, one devoted to catering and one, a large barn, the music venue. There are Muscovy ducks waddling around the farmyard and many goats in an enclosure just nearby. I strike up what I like to consider a strong and lasting relationship with the Head Goat (\"el gran cabro numero uno mas importante\", I call him). Somebody then points out that perhaps we should not get too attached. There is a large goat skin hanging up to dry on a metal frame and curried goat on tonight's menu.\n\t<p>\n\tLater, when I try to get fed, I discover that the choice of dining is restricted to this goat curry and a ferocious chilli con carne. Not fancying a dinner of cold white rice, I take solace in a dinner of liquorice allsorts before taking steps to ensure that I shall not think of food again. Thanks, lads.\n\t<p>\n\tThere is an endless wait for soundchecks, as nobody seems to have any clue as to what is going on. As well as Wilson and P-Hex, two local bands have been booked to play, and neither has been spotted yet. In the end, we settle for just checking the DAT player with the soundman, figuring that as long as this is reliable we can turn in a set. Then we amuse ourselves drinking, smoking and checking out the two large bonfires that have been started.\n\t<p>\n\tEventually the first band appears. They are all a little bit older than us, and they are a classic festival jamming band. Although they are not my thing at all, they seem quite well suited to the event. I begin to wonder if we really ought to be playing here, and entertain fantasies of clearing the barn altogether when our turn to play comes around. Not that I am really bothered whether we get to play or not, for I am having a perfectly good time already. \n\t<p>\n\tOthers do not take so well to Band No. 1. Certain elements of the NN1 posse start popping over to the soundman, telling him to put a stop to this degenerate hippy nonsense. Happily Band No. 1 draws its increasingly tedious set to a close without any coercion. \n\t<p>\n\tBand No. 2 are young and have a broken axle from trying to get to the farm. The good news is that this means that they can use the same drum kit as Band No. 1.\n\tThe bad news is that they play a set made up entirely of old rock covers, Jimi Hendrix and the like. Again, I worry that the Wilson sound might be that little bit...uh...unsuitable for the night. After all, this is a fiftieth birthday party in the middle of nowhere. Stevie G, however, tells me not to worry. \"Someone has to get a-hold of this thing and turn the vibe around,\" he tells me, \"I know I can do it...\" There is, I feel, a certain ring of desperation about his remark. \n\t<p>\n\tThe sun is down, the bonfires are raging, people are milling about in mad costumes, fuelled by drink, curry goat and God-knows what else. I think back to Sumosonic's doomed and foolhardy trip to Melchbourne in 1998, a date we dubbed Sumo Vietnam and which turned out to be our last ever gig. Have we been and gone and done it again? Are we facing Wilson Vietnam?\n\t<p>\n\tNow, as I have come to understand the situation, we shall be taking the Band No. 3 slot, with P-Hex topping the bill. But as the Queens Of The Stone Age do sonic battle with the KLF in the Wilson ghetto, Stevie G arrives to say that \n\tP-Hex are in disarray. Their drummer has taken a dislike to the situation and is agitating to get back to Northampton as quickly as possible. So P-Hex are now going to take the Band No. 3 slot and we are to move to the top of the bill. Oh Christ! At least P-Hex have played here before and gone down well. Whereas we have absolutely no idea what to expect.\n\t<p>\n\tP-Hex take the stage and are sounding strong. Whatever the emotional state of their drummer, he is playing hard and grinning from ear to ear. The barn is full of punters and the atmosphere really is picking up. The Reverend Lindsay rocks the house in his own special style and new vocalist Fiona is doing well. Stevie G can be seen, stage right, holding his guitar above his head and going mental. \n\t<p>\n\tOnce P-Hex are done there is a burst of activity as Wilson move their stuff onto the stage. It is now that I make a nasty discovery. The floor of the barn, it turns out, has recently been concreted, and there is still a huge amount of dust everywhere. By the time I am set up, my leads have turned colour from black to white and there is a fine sand all over my guitars. And all over me.\n\t<p>\n\tAs Quality People starts up, MC Bot is nowhere to be seen. In fact, he is standing by one of the bonfires, minding his own business. He suddenly comes barging into the barn, scattering punters, just in time to pick up the first line of the song! Despite the lack of a soundcheck, the band sounds great. Many thanks to Steve Ward for his work at the controls, and to the local soundmen for having such a good rig.\n\t<p>\n\tThere is not a whole lot of space on the stage here and I am under constant threat from our hyperactive lead singer. Imagine, therefore, my disquiet when, two songs into the set, Bot demands: \"Where are my dancers?\" Before I know it we are joined on stage by three Welsh girls in belly dancers' costumes! My pedals don't stand a chance: by the end of \"Burn Hollywood Burn\" my phaser is literally standing on its head. But we press on and \"Hippy Shit\" rocks the shack large-style. The punters are going Edgar Wallace Donuts. All my anxieties have been in vain. The barn is heaving and these fuckers are going for it in a big way.\n\t<p>\n\tAs we move into Critters I find myself standing unsteadily on one of the monitors. Curtis' pal with the sword is now onstage, trying to feed joints to the musicians. Because of the lack of space and the frenetic activity he is surprisingly unsuccessful in this. He resorts to firing off blowbacks, but even this is an inexact science in the onstage chaos. By the fiery ending of Dark Agenda he is simply taking a huge lungful and running up to people and French kissing them. It is, I can honestly say, the first time that I have been French kissed by a man while playing a guitar solo. Anywhere. The general reaction among the NN1 posse, as expressed by Kathie McGinty: \"How gay was that?\"\n\t<p>\n\tDark Agenda goes down in a blaze of noise, which somehow mutates into a spirited acapella \"Happy Birthday\" for Fred. The vibe is grand. It's time to pack up our filthy equipment and grab another beer. \n\t<p>\n\tBy the time we have packed up, it turns out that the P-Hex wagon has already set off back to Northampton with the dissident drummer on board, leaving Stevie G stranded without a ride. An hour or two goes by as we try to locate taxis to take us back to the hotel. Despite Fred's assurances that the local firms have been primed for our call, it is by now 3:00 am and we get nowhere. Stevie G curls up and goes to sleep in the back of The Zoo. Eventually, after some fairly agonised soul-searching and a swordsmanship exhibition from Curt's pal, we set off in a very slow convoy through the mist, making it back to the hotel a tense but uneventful fifteen minutes later. Curtis takes his newly colourful head to bed, and Kath, still jet-lagged does the same. For the rest of us it's the usual beer and smoke party at the hotel. Against all the odds we have come and done the shit. We decide two things: (i) we are some bad muthafuckas, and (ii) it has definitely been an away win. \n\t<p>\n\tMen Of The Match (so to speak): Kathy Schaer for perseverance beyond the call\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  of jetlag.

Two separate stages in the large-ish\n\t\t\tBrudenell Cheap Beer Club, five separate acts and an M.C. We've not been in Leeds long before\n\t\t\tthings get underway with an earnest fellow with a laptop. It was a bit unfair of the compere to let\n\t\t\ton that the poor fellow was really playing Solitaire while a dodgy old drum n bass tape played in\n\t\t\tthe background. To be honest, though, he really might as well have done that. How would anybody\n\t\t\thave known? Except it wasn't drum n bass - it was avant-bleepy Octopus Records 1997 sort of stuff.\n\t\t\tTwo numbers and he was gone.\n\t\t\tThen the deeply culturally significant, dapper and generally swell D. Millard did his thing. He\n\t\t\tscared elements among the swelling crowd of punters and came across loud and clear, thank you very\n\t\t\tmuch indeed. Why is he not famous? We must make it so.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThing is...when you're watching D. Millard screaming \"Religion OOOOUUUUUTTTT!!!!\" at people over a\n\t\t\ttinny eccentrically-tuned guitar, you're pretty much tempted to ask yourself, or a nearby punter.\n\t\t\tWell, how mental is that, then?\n\t\t\tAs it turned out, tonight, it would register as well, only a bit mental.\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tBut next, before there was time even to think of food, it was Wilson. Or \"Mister Wilson\", as we\n\t\t\twere so amusingly introduced by the M.C. We played the same set as at the Labour Club. I believe\n\t\t\tthat the sound in the room was significantly better than what some of us were hearing at the time.\n\t\t\tIt's not unusual. It didn't feel like we really caught fire (we could all hear ourselves, but you\n\t\t\tneed to hear what everyone is doing before you can really get into something.) Still, no horrors,\n\t\t\tand good, solid versions of everything, well received. Our last tune, which seems to be called\n\t\t\tBuffalo Sniper or something now, on only its second outing, turned really evil. It was like Neil\n\t\t\tYoung or something, but with horrid speed-garage blighters shouting \"HIT HIM AGAIN!\" over the top.\n\t\t\tOne of those huge feedback pile-ups to close and we're done. An away draw, shall we say, although I\n\t\t\tmight be being hard on the band there. Later, as I searched for the cigarette machine, two young\n\t\t\tteen girls stopped me and told me that we were their favourite band of the night. \"G'night, Mister\n\t\t\tWilson,\" they called. Curse that Diamond Jim!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen things went a bit strange for a while. You know how some bands have exactly the right name?\n\t\t\tHow they really couldn't be called anything else but that? Conjurer of Monikers stuff - inevitable,\n\t\t\taxiomatic and unchangeable. Hey, kids. Permit me to present: The Unpleasants.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI don't know if I'm equal to the task of describing this act. I understand that it's really a\n\t\t\tmember of the highly-regarded northern indie combo Hood. having a bit of a laugh on his nights off.\n\t\t\tStraight away, might I just suggest to Hood's agent (in the slim hope that he might read these\n\t\t\tthoughts) that he should be getting the band a lot more work. The Devil makes work for idle hands,\n\t\t\teven for folks in indie bands. That almost rhymes, that does. (Stick with me...if you're beginning\n\t\t\tto feel a touch irritated at the tone, please bear with it. It's my effort to give a feeling of\n\t\t\twhat it was like to be there.)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA man in a farmer's suit and flat cap sits at an electronic keyboard. He is wearing a ludicrous\n\t\t\tfalse beard. On the keyboard sits a monkey. Yes, a monkey. They talk to each other. It's like Keith\n\t\t\tHarris and Orville gone horribly, bickeringly, unpleasantly wrong.\n\t\t\tIn between their little chats, the farmer and the monkey play this...music... that sounds like what\n\t\t\tmight happen if Richard Formby accidentally blew up a science laboratory and went hopelessly,\n\t\t\tirredeemably mad. Kids, this is not Tom Waits noodling around coz the piano's been drinking, not\n\t\t\thim. No, Virginia, this is hideously well-organised, cheesy northern English...music and it's\n\t\t\twrong, boys and girls, it's deeply, deeply wrong. And there's a monkey.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn my innocence, I imagined that the farmer was taking advantage of his beard disguise to do the\n\t\t\ttalking on the monkey's behalf as well. Admittedly, he seemed to have the exchanges down to a fine\n\t\t\tart, but - hey! - if you're going to be good at something, eh, son? But no, it was so much worse\n\t\t\tthan that. There was another man - concealed about the back end of the club with a microphone -\n\t\t\tdoing the monkey's bit. This intelligence caused my brain to explode. Oh God, people, if you could\n\t\t\tjust hear their ghastly music. People say it was the monkey. The monkey was cack, sure. But, oh,\n\t\t\tGod help me, it was the music. The horrible, horrible, English music.

In geological time, anyway. Five-piece\n\t\t\ttraditional indie band. Madonna on keyboards (dressed down for the occasion), Monkey (Great King,\n\t\t\tEqual of Heaven) on lead guitar, Rufus and Doofus on drums and bass (indie sprawl, plod, splatter,\n\t\t\tplop) and some fey southern youth singing and playing guitar. \"You can't act like you created the\n\t\t\tstars, it's not right\" was their lyric (their enormous entourage will probably now have me arrested\n\t\t\tfor daring to print their lyrics without permission. Swivel.) sung to a very pretty melody. It\n\t\t\thelped that Madonna consented to adding a bit of backing vocal at this point. (I've heard she's all\n\t\t\tright on the consent thing.) And, errrrm...that was it. It churned on and on, self-regarding and\n\t\t\tself-pitying. Pack of bedwetters. I'm sure they'll do well. Rat-a-tat.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBut, hang on - the name thing : I mean, for Christ's sake - \"Sammy USA\" - surely, if anything means\n\t\t\tanything at all in this meretricious, facile shop-window of a world, then might we not count on a\n\t\t\tname like that to offer the prospect of some good old electricity, excitement, danger? Irony even,\n\t\t\tif you must. For a UK band even to have the letters \"USA\" in their name at this moment in \"history\"\n\t\t\t(Hey, gang? Remember when History wuz Dead? Me too! Francis Fukuyama - crazy name, crazy guy!)\n\t\t\tshould surely be some kind of signifier? Or (may I quote En Vogue here?) WHY EVEN BOTHER?

I remembered all the shite European\n\t\t\trock bands that I had seen on TV shows over there, who always seemed to have a moment when the long-haired\n\t\t\tguitar nutter suddenly runs out to the front, stuffs his foot on a monitor and gurns madly as the only\n\t\t\taudible bit of guitar on the whole record suddenly blurts out from the whirring of massed eighties\n\t\t\tsynthesisers.

It was a memorable \n\t\t\tevening, but the members of the posse who don't eat meat did have one \n\t\t\tsmall problem, what with curried goat being the dish of the day. Your \n\t\t\tcorrespondent had a whale of a time on a diet of Liquorice Allsorts, as \n\t\t\tit goes.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo it was that this August the corner shops of NN1 were systematically \n\t\t\tstripped of Mrs. McCartney's sausages and Soylent-Green-Burgers by \n\t\t\tshadowy, black-clad marginals. Instant barbecue kits were purchased from \n\t\t\tsupermarkets - along with jars of olives, jars of sun-dried peppers, \n\t\t\tmultiple dips, hummus, pitta bread, buns, chocolate. Somebody has packed \n\t\t\ta vegetable grater. By the time that Saturday comes, one thing is clear: \n\t\t\tthe veggie faction is not going to be caught out this year, no sir.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSomething else is to be different this year; the hotel where we stayed \n\t\t\tlast time has closed down while a new owner tries to make sense of it. \n\t\t\tThis time it's to be camping.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tEarly on a sunny Saturday afternoon the convoy sets off from the \n\t\t\tRacehorse. Kathie and I find ourselves travelling with the estimable Mr. \n\t\t\tCotton and Sarah. We stop to loot Oddbins of its Budvar and Urquell, \n\t\t\tthen, intending to avoid bank holiday motorway hell, we take to the back \n\t\t\troads: Builth the pretty way. Huge farm carts piled with hay rumble \n\t\t\talong in front of us at ten miles an hour. We play The Bad Seeds and the \n\t\t\tElectric Six as we negotiate strange, obscure country villages, some of \n\t\t\twhich appear to have been occupied by stealth by the Freedom - sorry, \n\t\t\tThe French. In Leominster deeply tranquillised pedestrians wander \n\t\t\theedlessly beneath our wheels.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tWe reach Builth in the lovely early evening sun. As we drive up the high \n\t\t\tstreet we see Stevie Ward's A-Team bus parked up, MC Bot hanging out \n\t\t\tof the passenger seat window with his bullhorn, yelling \"Wilson in the \n\t\t\tarea!\" just like he did 11 months ago. Builth Wells' picturesque \n\t\t\tlittle high street is heaving with people from Northampton.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tAfter a few fraught minutes in the Hinterland, we once again find the \n\t\t\tlane that leads to the party's secret secure location. We arrive to find \n\t\t\tthat a small camp has already sprung up in a far corner of the field and \n\t\t\there we join Russ and Nita, Misery, Mister E. Wilson, Stevie G, Stevie \n\t\t\tWard and his band. Tents go up, a fire pit is cleared for the barbie, \n\t\t\tthe Budvar crate takes a hammering. MC Bot bestrides the hillside with \n\t\t\this bullhorn.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tWitness the birth of NN109.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tAcross the field, resplendent under their gazebo in the evening light, \n\t\t\tsit the citizens of The High Chaparral, Jamie Jab and his crew of \n\t\t\tmentallists. Relations between the twin settlements will be warm and \n\t\t\tincreasingly incoherent as the evening wears on.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tThe entertainment is nothing like what we had been led to expect. No \n\t\t\tWelsh bands are taking part this year, and a PA has only just been \n\t\t\tsecured. That leaves only us and the debut performance from Stevie \n\t\t\tWard's new band, Good Cop Bad Cop. There are many members of P-Hex in \n\t\t\tthe area (well, in the field, I should say), but they are light of a \n\t\t\tdrummer. Stevie G makes a brave attempt to persuade Mr. Cotton to play \n\t\t\tthe drums, but Mr. Cotton is confused, thinking that Steve is referring \n\t\t\tto Wilson's set. \"Have you cleared this mad idea with Pat?\" he asks. \n\t\t\t\"I don't have to,\" replies Steve bafflingly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tThere is also the inconvenient fact that Mr. Cotton is actually a \n\t\t\tguitarist, not a drummer at all.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tSo in the end we explain to the frightened-looking young lads with the \n\t\t\tPA that they only have two bands to worry about. Kit is set up and sound \n\t\t\tis checked. The courtyard is crowded with happy people eating barbecued \n\t\t\tgoat. We leg it back to NN109 for the first hot food of the evening.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tAs night sets in there are amazing views of the stars. You can see the \n\t\t\tMilky Way clearly. \"I can see why the Egyptians saw it as a mirror image \n\t\t\tof the Nile,\" I venture, and promptly fall into a hole. If you're \n\t\t\tlucky with the clouds, you can see Mars, as close as it has been to our \n\t\t\tEarth since the days when Neanderthals roamed the hillsides, making \n\t\t\ttheir camps, lighting their fires, cooking their food and singing their \n\t\t\tsongs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tASTERRRRROOOOOID! COMING IN FROM THE VOID!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs the awesome sounds of the new Killing Joke album split the air, the \n\t\t\tentire sky clouds over. What can it mean? My utility belt tells me \"To \n\t\t\tthe barn, Batman.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGood Cop Bad Cop are heavy. A mean metal three-piece. There are great \n\t\t\ttunes in there, but the PA boys have got things so cranked that it's \n\t\t\tnot always easy to tell from inside the barn: the band actually sound \n\t\t\tbetter from about 40 yards away. Still, it's a fine first gig for \n\t\t\tthem. Their drummer is quite something, a definite touch of the Grohls \n\t\t\tin there.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tMC Bot takes to the decks, banging out Primal Scream, The Streets, \n\t\t\tWepunex, The Prodigy and Killing Joke. We wire ourselves up, ready to \n\t\t\tgo. Then it's time. It takes a moment to get the DAT up and running, \n\t\t\tbut soon the barn is echoing to the sound of Tim Leary and his \n\t\t\tpsychedelic sheep.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tWe start with a new, toughened-up version of God's Green Earth before \n\t\t\tdiving headlong into the Hippy Shit. The monitors are fairly screaming \n\t\t\tat us onstage, but out front it's a clear, bass-heavy sound, with \n\t\t\tMisery taking full advantage of Good Cop Bad Cop's excellent bass rig \n\t\t\t(thanks, Alex!). She plays a blinder and the band feels great, we're \n\t\t\tflying. The set:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGOD'S GREEN EARTH - HIPPY SHIT - SWEET HOME ALABAMA - BURN HOLLYWOOD \n\t\t\tBURN - ISTANBUL CONNECTION - CRITTERS - SECRET GOVERNMENT - EVERY \n\t\t\tSATURDAY NIGHT - POLICE CHIEF - QUALITY PEOPLE - YELLOW PAGES - BUFFALO \n\t\t\tSNIPER - DARK AGENDA.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs we start into Yellow Pages I realise that my microphone has gone \n\t\t\ttotally dead. In a mad panic, I seize Bot's mic and shout my way back \n\t\t\ton board. It ain't pretty, but it works. Confusing, though - why \n\t\t\tshould it just go down like that? Bizarrely, at the end of the song I \n\t\t\tget my mic back. Life goes on, but then, just as Buffalo Sniper should \n\t\t\tbe gathering force and steaming out of the breakdown, something really \n\t\t\tspectacular happens. For the first time ever at a gig we find ourselves \n\t\t\twithout any kind of backing track. We're just running on our own \n\t\t\tmomentum. Fascinating - no time to think about it: we adopt a kind of \n\t\t\tchug, hold our nerve and eventually rejoin the backing track as it \n\t\t\tmysteriously resurfaces towards the end of the tune. Dark Agenda goes \n\t\t\toff all right, featuring a chant of \"No techno! No techno!\" and an even \n\t\t\tmore out-of-control finish than usual. I leave my Telecaster feeding \n\t\t\tback in a pile of rubble at the side of the stage and run out of the \n\t\t\tbarn. I stand in the courtyard for a minute or two, listening to the \n\t\t\tsheets of filthy noise issuing forth. Then I run back in though another \n\t\t\tdoor, to find MC Bot crouched over my effects, making mayhem. We escape \n\t\t\twith our lives.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEven as we start to pack up, the techno begins. Out in the little yard \n\t\t\tin front of the barn some eight or ten youths have gathered. They play \n\t\t\tthe deepest, darkest, dumbest techno at the loudest volume and set about \n\t\t\tgetting silently, wholly monged. We make a surprisingly efficient job of \n\t\t\tstowing our kit and flee the area.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBack at NN109 I'm talking about the weird way that the top quality, \n\t\t\tsuper-loud PA just suddenly went completely random on us towards the end \n\t\t\tof the set. That's when somebody explains about the techno lads. \n\t\t\tTowards the end of the set they came into the back of the barn (like \n\t\t\tI'd notice. I'm a fecking guitar scientist, me. I'm lucky if I \n\t\t\tnotice anything back there) and started taking the record decks and \n\t\t\ttheir attendant electronic shit out into the little yard. In so doing, \n\t\t\tapparently, they managed to unplug loads of wires that had nothing to do \n\t\t\twith the disco set-up, but everything to do with our disappearing drum \n\t\t\tloops.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tI have to say that my first reaction to this intelligence is to want to \n\t\t\tgo and batter the wotless youths within an inch of terminal oblivion. \n\t\t\tHappily, better living through advanced biochemistry is achieved and I \n\t\t\tcome to take the broader view. Clarity, Simon, that's the main thing. \n\t\t\tWith understanding comes forbearance. With half-litre bottles of Budvar \n\t\t\tcome custom cigarettes and sausages in buns.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tFor hours people gather around the barbie, drink, smoke, speculate, \n\t\t\tcelebrate the footie results. The techno never lets up. Boom! Boom! \n\t\t\tBoom! There is ill-advised cooking. Stevie D appears to freeze like a \n\t\t\tstatue, completely motionless out there in the night. Then, as Stevie G \n\t\t\tgoes to investigate, he drops like a felled tree. Into the car he goes. \n\t\t\t'Night, Steve.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDaylight comes. Profoundly unevenly cooked Linda sausages litter the \n\t\t\tarea. Everybody has lost everything. Ian from P-Hex goes to sleep on the \n\t\t\tground. Jamie is heading back to the High Chaparral (though I can never \n\t\t\tremember this name - I keep on wanting to say \"Camp X-Ray\" but I know \n\t\t\tthat's not right, so I just sort of get lockjaw), but before he goes \n\t\t\the seals me into the back of Russell's motor, where I plan to sleep. \n\t\t\tAs the hatchback closes on me I give him the thumbs-up through the \n\t\t\tglass. I feel like a spaceman being sealed in his little capsule.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tI awake to the sound of somebody (Curtis, as it turns out) playing \n\t\t\telectric guitar. It's quite beautiful, but it's coming from far away \n\t\t\tand I'm still three-quarters asleep and it's a little bit hard to \n\t\t\tmake out. There are weird little high frequency squeaks going on, which \n\t\t\tI assume must be the amplified sound of fingers on strings. Once I \n\t\t\textract myself from the back of the car in an ungainly fashion, it \n\t\t\tbecomes clear that these high frequency squeaks are, in fact, coming \n\t\t\tfrom a small and excited dog, whom Misery and Sarah are tormenting with \n\t\t\ta luminous green frisbee.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tThe morning is overcast but incredibly hot. Bodies are strewn across the \n\t\t\tfield. There is suffering. Somehow, heroically, Mr. Cotton takes the \n\t\t\twheel of his car and prepares to take us home. Russ urges him to visit \n\t\t\tthe cheese shop in Monkland.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\t\"Yeah, just gimme the fuckin' cheese!\" cries Stevie G with feeling.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThat's right. Monkland. Also, not far from here, they have a place \n\t\t\tcalled Paincastle.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA road closure because of an accident on the A-44 leads to our being \n\t\t\tcompelled to drive home over the very roof of the world. I fall asleep \n\t\t\tin the back of the car, and awake to find that we are pulling into a gas \n\t\t\tstation. In Telford. It has to be said, it is a class gas station, with \n\t\t\ta proper shop and a nice Days Inn attached, so that you could - in \n\t\t\ttheory - check in for a few days and get a proper feel for the place. \n\t\t\tA kind man in London subsequently sent me the attached illustration, \n\t\t\tshowing clearly the delights of checking in at the Telford Days Inn.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tWe arrived in NN1 at teatime, battered.

They had cheerfully ignored his\n\t\t\tsuggestions that a trip to Turkey starting on Monday might be just the ticket. Instead, they booked him onto a\n\t\t\tholiday trip that departed on Saturday morning. Steve only discovered this on Friday evening, and to be fair, he\n\t\t\tcame straight and told the other members of the band that he was suddenly and unexpectedly out of the starting\n\t\t\tline-up for Sunday's gig. Naturally, we abused him luxuriously and left him to his fate. For the clueless\n\t\t\tflatmates had not booked Steve a nice trip to Turkey. Oh no. Our poor guitarist found himself gazing straight\n\t\t\tdown the barrel of a full ten days in a compulsory-sex-and-throwing-up gulag in Ibiza! Somebody pointed out that\n\t\t\tit makes Guantanamo Bay seem like quite an attractive distination.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFaintly rattled, the remaining quintet pulled together a rehearsal on Saturday night, a lengthy but relaxed\n\t\t\taffair, enlivened by calls of \"Sack the bald bloke!\" from a passing Sonic Boom. The few pals in attendance\n\t\t\tdeclared that we appeared perfectly match-fit as a quintet, and we felt all right.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNow, about Magic Skool Bus...\n\t\t\tIt has crossed our minds that maybe they were winding us up. If so, they deserve some kind of award.\n\t\t\tUK readers will be only too aware that pubs close at half past ten of a Sunday. We had organised a three band\n\t\t\tbill, which really was all that there was time for. Over the weekend, the drummer of Magic Skool Bus, one Rory by\n\t\t\tname, advised us first that there was to be a fourth band on the bill, then - at the soundcheck - that a FIFTH\n\t\t\tensemble was on its way to join in the fun!\n\t\t\tFrankly, I couldn't see how on earth Rory was going to get four bands on and off the stage in time for us to get\n\t\t\ton at ten o'clock.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe decided that it was probably for the best if we just let Rory and his pals get on with doing whatever they\n\t\t\twere going to do, so after a quick and easy soundcheck we quit the theatre of operations and kept out of the way.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt about eight thirty I stuck my head around the door of the venue. Small herds of teens milled across the dance\n\t\t\tfloor while Victims of the Establishment did their punk rock thing. Damn fine it was too. V.O.T.E. seem to have\n\t\t\ttaken on that Wilson thing of having three big blokes yelling at you all at the same time, and it worked well.\n\t\t\tThey looked good, they sounded good and by golly it did me good. After a couple of tunes I headed back to the\n\t\t\tfront bar to join the growing pack of friends and mentallists assembling to see my band. Johnny Octopus and his\n\t\t\tgirlfriend had come up from London, and we were also graced with a visit from a gentleman who worked on the\n\t\t\tBritish Mars probe that just blasted off the other day. I don't think I've ever met a man who had launched a\n\t\t\tspace ship before. (Or does Kizzy O'Callaghan count?)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA few beers later, I popped my head around the door again, and was delighted to find Magic Skool Bus taking the\n\t\t\tstage. This band is very mad. They play ska-punk music, with a three piece horn section. They play very fast\n\t\t\tindeed. The teens were digging it like good 'uns. I was just happy that MSB had made it onstage in time. \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhen it came time for The Bus to leave the stage I grabbed Rory: \"Congratulations, mate. I don't know how you did\n\t\t\tit, but we're bang on time.\" He replied: \"Well, the fact that two of the bands didn't show up might have\n\t\t\thelped...\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo there we have it. Three bands, just like it said on the posters. So what was it? Were there really two mystery\n\t\t\tbands who just failed to show up? Or was it all just the Wind-Up Of The Week? We here at Planet Wilson STILL\n\t\t\tdon't know!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAround about ten o'clock, then, we got up. And from the very beginning we knew we were going to be having a bit\n\t\t\tof a night. The crowd had swelled by now, with many of the usual suspects in the area and bent on mayhem. This\n\t\t\tbeing the case, we thought that maybe we should deliver them of exactly that - mayhem. And that, dear readers, is\n\t\t\twhat they got. With Steve safely locked away in the fleshpots of San Antonio, I turned up the amplifier and went\n\t\t\tfor it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCurtis was on fine form too. In addition to his Air-FX machine, he is now also the proud owner of an Air-Synth.\n\t\t\tNot that you would know: he has taken to concealing all his technology in a small box draped in black fabrics.\n\t\t\tThere was some talk about maybe printing something on the box. My favourite suggestion was: \"CASSETTE PLAYER\".\n\t\t\tThe sound was good and strong, with Misery laying down rock-hard bass. As the set went on, Skinner began to drop\n\t\t\tdelays and effects into the mix. We gave it some forty minutes, detonated the last chord of Dark Agenda with some\n\t\t\tfirst-class sonic Semtex, and split, leaving the happy punters bellowing for more through the feedback. I can't\n\t\t\tsay for certain, of course, but it felt as if we had just hit a new level altogether. As Mr. Cotton put it, \"A\n\t\t\tstunning performance , I realise that you felt you were on the brink of relegation , but I think you went on to\n\t\t\tWin The Cup.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMr. Cotton is also responsible for the accompanying screen dump. God bless him!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRecords and shirts were sold. Money changed hands. MC Bot (who had a blinder himself, by the way) appeared with a\n\t\t\tcase of Becks Bier. We jumped into Steve Ward's jet-black A-Team stealth van and vanished into the NN1 night.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhen I went into Deepak's shop this morning, he said \"I hear you had a good gig last night.\" Bloody hell, if\n\t\t\tpeople are volunteering glowing reviews of our shows to their local shopkeepers, we must be doing something\n\t\t\tright.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOh, and I heard it was raining in Ibiza...saucer of milk for Number 77 please...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHeadstone NN1 28/7/2003"},{"gigtext_id":447,"datetime":"2003-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Eider and I have been secured to play a wedding...in Northampton!

No time for mutual fan-club\n\t\t\taction, though, for we had to clear our shit away to make room for the\n\t\t\theadliners, an agreeable quartet from Nottingham called Fin. Their style\n\t\t\tis a bit all-over-the-place, but they play very well and Jamie, their\n\t\t\tsinger, definitely has the looks and the charisma for the job.

He looks at me: \"How long do you think we'll last?\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHe's got a point. We aren't really the kind of thing that you see in village pubs a great deal. Yes, we do the\n\t\t\todd cover version, but no, it's not Status Quo or Travis. We're also kind of loud. Despite the fact that we've\n\t\t\tbeen invited there to play for Guy Fletcher's\n\t\t\tlong-awaited birthday knees-up, there is a detectable whiff of \"Is that all you do?\" on the breeze with this one.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor the first time in ages we arrive at the gig in the dark. E-Man having thoroughly explored the entire region,\n\t\t\tI finally persuade him to drive us into Weedon village itself, where we soon spy a small traffic congestion\n\t\t\tscenario as the other memers of the band load their kit into an attractive, flower-bedecked country pub. Not the\n\t\t\tsort of place we usually play. At all. I slip in through the door to discover that the pub is (a) really rather\n\t\t\ttiny, and (b) extremely loud. This is down to a pack of young village lads, average age about 19 (don't it make\n\t\t\tyou sick, American readers?), who are already blind, screaming drunk at 6:30pm. As I struggle my amp into\n\t\t\tposition on a skittles table I console myself with the thought that, by the time we go on, all these boys will be\n\t\t\tlying quietly in a coma somewhere.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith a great deal of help from Mister Fletcher we get ourselves installed and wired up in a tiny space at the end\n\t\t\tof the bar.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith the lads still howling all around us, we launch into a version of Hippy Shit for a sound check.\n\t\t\tWe arrive at a reasonale balance and stop. There is a misguided smattering of applause. Then we watch,\n\t\t\tastonished, as all the drunk boys file quietly past us and out of the pub. One or two are shaking slightly. One\n\t\t\tor two say things like \"Really good, lads. See you later.\" Stevie G fixes me with a satisfied beam and declares\n\t\t\t\"Wel, THEY won't be back...\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's round about now that the Hull City Ultras appear, 15 quid the lighter from their scenic taxi ride with a\n\t\t\tdriver who took the time out to tell them \"That Jazz Butcher - good little band.\" There, readers, but for the\n\t\t\tgrace of God and a pathological inability to work a steering wheel, goes your correspondent. I don't spot any\n\t\t\tBrazilians, though. With everything in order, we sink a beer and stroll over to Mister Fletcher's house across\n\t\t\tthe street, where hot food awaits.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMC Bot and I go careering into Mister Fletcher's rather lovely little cottage, bellowing in laughable Welsh\n\t\t\taccents about the decor. Stevie G's pal Maxine remains convinced that we are both Welsh. Next we are going to\n\t\t\ttell people that E-Man is Norwegian, Misery is Scottish and Agent Wilson was born in a boxcar on the Santa Fe\n\t\t\trailroad. Stevie G himself, of course, really is from Argentina. Mister Fletcher, being a pro musician himself,\n\t\t\thas thoughtfully laid on a top spread, which is gratefully mauled by the assembled. Then there is frantic rolling\n\t\t\tand smoking prior to our return to the pub and the Moment of Truth.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe bar is heaving. It's Friday night anyway, Guy's pals have all come out for his party, and then there is a\n\t\t\tsurprisingly large numer of folks out from NN1 to see the group. All very gratifying, but it's more than Bot and\n\t\t\tI can handle, so we head back out into the car park. Around the back of the pub is a lovely wee garden. I am\n\t\t\ttransfixed by an enormous and very beautiful willow tree billowing out over the lawn. I'm thinking how good it\n\t\t\twould look in the bright October sun. Bot says it looks like a Wookie. We pile onto the little kiddies' assault\n\t\t\tcourse erection, cross a precarious rope bridge and arrive at the top of a wooden tower, where we enjoy a panic\n\t\t\tattack.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDuly refreshed by our brush with nature's grandeur we take up our instruments and start Hippy Shit for real.\n\t\t\tWithin seconds Bot's mic stand is on the floor in bits. It's a bit of an avant-garde design, honestly, and it\n\t\t\tstands no chance with the plucky MC. The room is full of people sitting at tables, all facing us as if asking \"So\n\t\t\twhy do you want this job, Mister Wilson?\" The situation is weird, but the sound is surprisingly together. It's a\n\t\t\tbit like skateboarding (with my centre of gravity!), but we arrive gracefully enough at the end of this rather\n\t\t\thostile opener to what sounds like applause. Onward!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt all went pretty sweetly. There were times when I was finding it hard to hear the backing track. For a while I\n\t\t\ttried seeing what would happen if I took my cue from watching Misery's fingers hitting the strings. Probably\n\t\t\teasier to follow Agent, honestly, but you don't know until you try. It all held together well, though, and went\n\t\t\tdown well with the assembled. In fact the landlady asked for our phone number so that she could book us again!\n\t\t\tGood grief. We gave it to her as well. What were we thinking? We'd just got away with murder, after all.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter the show I enjoyed a pint with Pete Watkins from the Bareback Ryders, handed out a couple of CDs, heard a\n\t\t\tcouple more Happy Mondays comparisons and one with Alabama 3. We've got no problem with that short of comparison\n\t\t\tat all. We find it flattering. Thanks. We got invited to play a party in NN1. We had another beer and packed up.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen something rather strange came to pass. Looking out of the pub window I saw a large minibus, engine running,\n\t\t\twith members of the group climbing aboard. Instinct takes over at times like this. I had been told that Guy had\n\t\t\tlaid on a ride home for us at about 1:00am. And yet here at midnight stood The Bus before my very eyes. Well, of\n\t\t\tcourse, that was me on board with all my kit. Turned out to be completely the wrong bus. Missed the party after\n\t\t\tthe gig. Bah. Never mind - back to MC Bot's and from there to liquor-induced oblivion.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo we got away with playing the village pub. An away win, we all agreed. And, as I said to Misery, when I'm up\n\t\t\tthere on the stage at Cargo with that big old Turbosound system and all those fancy lights and shit, I shall\n\t\t\tremember where it was that I played the gig before that."},{"gigtext_id":460,"datetime":"2004-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Another Wilson gig for the calendar.

Maybe, I reckon, they were just plain oppressed by the\n\t\t\tsheer volume and darkness of the alleged entertainment. Everybody I spoke to after the show seemed\n\t\t\twell taken with the set; they just weren't about to let us know while it was going on. Or\n\t\t\tsomething. A lot of people didn't realise that we had finished either. They thought that maybe we\n\t\t\twould be going on for a second set. Well, I must admit that the majority of us do look like we\n\t\t\tbelong in a a pub band, but really. No, folks, if you wanted more you should have done the old\n\t\t\tritual thing and shouted and shit. Oh, hang on, that's right. I hate the rock concert ritual.

The track is crisp and bright and brutal, the\n\t\t\tbass is heavy, the guitarists have only ever heard Arc and Weld in their lives. As far as we are\n\t\t\tconcerned, we are a heaving black crater of evil doom and justice. Botman Bot doesn't even turn up\n\t\t\tfor the first two verses. You can see people wondering and worrying. Are we going to watch this\n\t\t\tband fall to pieces right in front of our eyes on an innocent Saturday night out? First no Curtis,\n\t\t\tnow no Bot...what can it all mean? Botman Bot arrives via the front door, bang on time to deliver\n\t\t\tCurtis' crime rap on God's Green One. Headstone is yelling \"rip up the phone boxes!\" It's all\n\t\t\tedgy, sparky, exciting. To us anyway. Maybe it looks unprofessional or something. We know that the\n\t\t\tsound is good. Andy's magic PA strikes again.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's into a new tune next. I wrote the words to the chorus the morning after the gig. Well, it'll\n\t\t\tbe an excuse to come down to the next one, won't it? Then we're off into a run of 3 rockers.\n\t\t\tSomewhere in the midst thereof, we achieve Our Perfect Sound. It's evil and fizzing and swinging\n\t\t\tits massive great ass all over the place. There's singing - harmonies even - and shouting and\n\t\t\tbanging and wailing and squawking and Stephen Fecking Hawking. We do the best version ever of\n\t\t\tBuffalo Sniper. Yes, I was compelled to sing large chunks of \"Rocking in the Free World\" at the\n\t\t\tsame time as Bot was doing the proper lyric. Do you want to make something of it?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter a sneaky little Secret Government we descend into a swaggering and hostile version of Play\n\t\t\tIt All Night Long. Every Saturday Night does nothing to lighten the mood. Critters is chiefly\n\t\t\tabout shouting and violence and war and hate and the Loch Ness Monster and it's over in a second\n\t\t\tand then it's all aboard the Taliban Jeep for a swift and sweaty-palmed review of Wilson's Dark\n\t\t\tAgenda.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt kicks off. Botman Bot is giving it \"Bitter & twisted! Go ballistic!\" from Fat Controller. The\n\t\t\tkick drum is a truck. The bass is a huge big tanker full of something with a specific gravity far\n\t\t\tin excess of its half-life. The guitars are fizzing like nasty little cluster bombs. Inevitably,\n\t\t\tthere is a hideous and protracted pile-up. The poor bloody audience are witnessing something that\n\t\t\thas nothing to do with either entertainment or anger management. Fuck, it feels good.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd that's it. Lord, it's quiet. Me, I just reckon people were shell-shocked.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYou know, maybe we just weren't entertaining.

We're into one of our\n\t\t\tphases right now, and, if it be the Will of God, the next few shows could see Wilson mutating into\n\t\t\tsomething even more mental.

Convinced that this is, in fact, a Saturday (dammit - it's always been\n\t\t\tSaturday in Builth before...) I spend a moment fretting about the football results.\n\t\t\tThere are, of course, none. Fed and watered, we engage in a little light shopping for\n\t\t\tlate night beer, then return to base to watch Pobol Y Cum on the telly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSome of our number stop by at a little funfair which has set up beside the river in the\n\t\t\tpark. There is a thing there called Monkey Kingdom. Thanos is with us. There are a\n\t\t\tnumber of odd little machines there whose primary purpose would appear to be the\n\t\t\tpiecemeal but dogged pollution of the otherwise unfeasibly wholesome Welsh air. Stevie\n\t\t\tWard from Good Cop Bad Cop is profoundly irritated by the presence of this fair. He was\n\t\t\tplanning on a quiet night's kip in the van beside the river. No chance of that now.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tLater, when Jamie and Yvette decide to stroll down and visit the funfair, it shuts\n\t\t\tdown.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe return to the venue to hear the last strains of Brown Thunder covering Cum On Feel\n\t\t\tThe Noize. It's their first gig. They're schoolboys. They haven't played Glastonbury.\n\t\t\tWe know this, for this is their first gig. (For a few moments overheard an hour or two\n\t\t\tlater in the carpark, it appears that it may also turn out to be their last.) They may\n\t\t\tbe named after a Roy Chubby Brown video. Their bass player later lends us his amplifier\n\t\t\tafter negotiations so complex that several UN staff had to be called in. At the end of\n\t\t\tthe night he is to be seen sitting on the bottom of the steps outside the venue,\n\t\t\tbarfing like a professional.\n\t\t\t\"Has he lost his lunch?\" I ask one of his pals.\n\t\t\t\"Oh, he lost that a long time ago.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA Fat Dog Sound get themselves onstage with commendable speed, then stay up there for\n\t\t\tabout thirty six hours. They have a new, improved drummer and I still think their\n\t\t\tbassist is great. They are moving into a pretty strange place at the moment. Their\n\t\t\topening number has shades of the Velvet Underground's \"Ocean\".\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFat Dog are followed by Good Cop Bad Cop, with MC Bot at the controls. Strangely,\n\t\t\tthings appear to have taken a turn for the loud. I actually manage to spend all the\n\t\t\tGood Cop set outside the building, but this in no impedes my capacity for hearing and\n\t\t\tenjoying the music to the full. Ears must be bleeding in there.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs the next band gears up to go onstage we take ourselves back stage to put the drums\n\t\t\tand stuff together. As we pass across the stage, Russ spots the pianist having A Right\n\t\t\tArtistic. Whatever is eating him soon gets sorted, for the band are up and playing...a\n\t\t\tJames Brown number! \"Bloody hell, Steve - we've got to follow Tom Jones!\" Sadly, that's\n\t\t\tabout as much fun as we have with them. Well, apart from being stimulated to re-open\n\t\t\tthat well-loved Crap Sax Players Of The Eighties debate.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd then the desperate minutes as we step out onto the stage to see if there is anybody\n\t\t\tout there to help us get plugged up. On asking one bloke for the sound man, I'm told\n\t\t\t\"There isn't one.\" Well, at least we've got that cleared up, then. Eventually the man\n\t\t\tfrom Bristol appears. He hasn't much of a clue what is going on, keeps saying he's on\n\t\t\tholiday, thinks he's in a place called \"Blythe\". Somehow he helps us get plugged up\n\t\t\twhile at the front of the stage Fred Ryan has his eyebrows waxed off for charity.\n\t\t\t&pound;138:00 the pair, since you ask.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOnce Fred has been sufficiently tortured, we turn on the DAT and hope for the best. The\n\t\t\tbacking track comes crashing back at us at about 60 billion decibels and we're off.\n\t\t\tStarting with Police Chief, it's a high energy set and soon there is action on the\n\t\t\tdance floor. We steam through a short and furious set, stopping only now and again when\n\t\t\tStevie G - for reasons that he is still unable to clarify - insists on stopping the\n\t\t\tbacking track. Not during the tunes themselves, you understand. He's not that gone,\n\t\t\tJackson. Stevie Ward is at the controls now, doing a grand job. We deliver phatness and\n\t\t\tshouting in extra-large portions, blow up Dark Agenda and leave. As we go, two people\n\t\t\tshake my hand: one, a gnarly old rock dude in his forties, proper rock handshakes and\n\t\t\teverything; the other, a 17-year old Welsh chick in high street chic who thinks \"That\n\t\t\twas bloody excellent, that!\"\n\t\t\tWilson - Bridging the Generation Gap. With shouting.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tP-Hex come to deliver the coup de grace to an audience fast falling to the effects of\n\t\t\thard liquor and evil dub. The Rev. Lindsay does not disappoint and the funk machine\n\t\t\trolls out, with the added firepower of Andy Fruish's trumpet combining with Ben's\n\t\t\tsaxophones. Now that, boys and girls, is a horn section. At some stage MC Bot wanders\n\t\t\tonto the stage, apparently squeezing a version of Sumosonic's \"Business and work\" into\n\t\t\tthe P-Hex repertoire. An encore is demanded and a strange jam ensues, a cool sort of\n\t\t\tmajor/minor thing, where I am surprised to hear Lindsay singing the oddly romantic line\n\t\t\t\"Such a smile!\" Your correspondent has since been set straight. The lyric is, of\n\t\t\tcourse: \"Such a slag!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy the time that P-Hex are done with them, the punters are looking profoundly damaged.\n\t\t\tThe lad from Brown Thunder is not alone. People are heaving and a-weaving. Outside the\n\t\t\tfront doors, people are lying helpless in the road.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe night has raised well over a thousand pounds for the Romanian hospice project.

The album is the brainchild of Bristol\n\t\t\tnative Jesse Vernon, who is backed by Jim Barr and John Baggott of the\n\t\t\tbrilliant Portishead. Together, their songs place soul-rousing writing\n\t\t\tinside of atmospheres drawn from a Tom Waits dream of the afterlife. Never\n\t\t\tonce flinching into pop accessibility, the album flows on a cloudy drone\n\t\t\tthat peaks during the stellar fuzz of \"This is For You\" and ends with the\n\t\t\trousing \"Keepers of the Fire.\" So while the nu-crooner revolution may not\n\t\t\texactly be at hand, My Place in the Dust at least makes a good case for it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy Matt Charlton<br>\n\t\t\tExclaim Magazine - June 4, 2003\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\tand\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tMORNING STAR<br>\n\t\t\tMy Place in the Dust (D7/Dep)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tProduced by PJ Harvey and Sparklehorse collaborator John Parish, and\n\t\t\tassisted by Portishead's Jim Barr and John Baggott, Bristol's Morning Star\n\t\t\t(aka Jesse D.

Almost too fine, in fact. Andy and I set up the PA and soundchecked\n\t\t\tthe bands in blazing summer heat. Even as we did, it crossed our minds that nobody in their right mind would\n\t\t\twant to spend and evening like this crammed into a small club like ours. It would just be too uncomfortable.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAll preparations made, we took <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a>, Jesse Morningstar and his rhythm section for dinner, a brief\n\t\t\tmoment of calm during which we ate tortelloni, learned important things about our guests and worked the Rizla\n\t\t\taccordingly. On our return to the Labour Club, we were disheartened to see that our fears had come true.\n\t\t\tThere were about 8 people in the room, 6 of whom looked as though the last thing they needed was a dose of\n\t\t\tlive music.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTwelve minutes later the room was full.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJoe was first up. His guitar sound is fuller and fatter than ever before, and it proved a worthy magic carpet\n\t\t\ton which to ride. With his smart new fabrics and classy, confident performance, Joe had the punters sitting\n\t\t\tup and paying attention to just how much he has been improving as a performer over the past few months.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCurtis E. Johnson simply arrived in the building, sat down, plugged in and started. Plenty of classic\n\t\t\toriginals, delivered on electric guitar in a brash, no-nonsense style. A version of The Cockroach That Ate\n\t\t\tCincinatti really got things stirred up, before our hero was joined onstage by Psychedelic Terry Walpole (The\n\t\t\tOnly One Of Its Kind) for a raging rendition of the Incredible String Band's \"Dear Old Battlefield\". Against\n\t\t\tall the odds, the unlikely trichological twosome brought it off large-style and left the stage to warm\n\t\t\tapplause.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen a boy with looks like Buddy Holly and a voice like John Lennon takes the stage, toting a tiny\n\t\t\tnylon-string classical guitar. The first number (during which, I must confess, I managed to leave the\n\t\t\tintroductory music still playing through the poor bastard's foldback!) was halting and a more than a little\n\t\t\ton the gloomy side. Them natives was restless. But as soon as the unwanted accompaniment was removed from the\n\t\t\tmonitors, Jesse and his band began to weave real magic. Soul, gospel, folk and blues all passed through their\n\t\t\tever-so-slightly wonky West Country culture filter, gradually drawing the audience in until they were\n\t\t\tgrinning like fools. Their skills and inventiveness left people breathless as they showed just what a wide\n\t\t\trange of colours three individuals can conjour at one gig. An inspired version of \"Tighten Up\" secured an\n\t\t\taway win for the plucky Bristolian beatniks, and from then on it was disbelieving grins all the way, as Jesse\n\t\t\tand his boys layed encore after encore upon a delirious crowd.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNeedless to say, the evening ended in moronically good-natured mayhem and Spanish champagne at Shakespeare\n\t\t\tVillas.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJesse exceeded everybody's expectations.

The mighty little Labour Club PA punched above its weight once again, the band squeezed\n\t\t\titself into the stage area (which we were sharing with a large Christmas Tree!) and we even managed to draft in the\n\t\t\tcelebrated oil wheel in an effort to vibe up the room. Of course, what you really need to vibe up the place is a pack\n\t\t\tof raving punters, up on their hind legs and baying for dub mayhem, and happily, with tonight seeing the birthday\n\t\t\tcelebrations of both the Great Yvette Bailey and Public Enemy Number One, the right reverend Lindsay Spence, a crowd\n\t\t\twas soon assembled.

Unbelievably, the vast\n\t\t\tmajority remained rooted to the spot, watching open-mouthed as the sonic brutality unfolded\n\t\t\tbefore them.

If that sounds like a pair of flash\n\t\t\tso-and-soes showing off their dubious skills on a mess of instruments, then I've misled you\n\t\t\tby accident. These two focussed, dedicated musicians worked effortlessly and with minimal\n\t\t\tfuss to fill the room with their perfectly balanced, fascinatingly dense and melodic sounds.\n\t\t\tTheir set encompassed tunes from the 2003 Enraptured album \"Transcendental\" as well as brand\n\t\t\tnew tunes yet to be released, for example the sublime \"Burn Till You Die\" which somehow\n\t\t\tmanages to evoke Kraftwerk, Spacemen 3 and cheery mid-seventies yob-rock all at the same\n\t\t\ttime. Jon's drumming had Sonic enthusing wildly, while my eyes barely left the neck of\n\t\t\tMark's guitar. Well, you live and learn, do you not? Inevitably, the crowd went nuts and\n\t\t\tencores were duly delivered, including an incredible version of Joy Division's \"Heart and\n\t\t\tSoul\" which may or may not have mutated into \"Jingle Bells\" somewhere along the way. No, it\n\t\t\tmust be my fevered imagination. A truly magisterial set in most every way.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe evening finished up with Will spinning more sides while people got really, really\n\t\t\ttwisted. A smashing night: three great acts, four ex-Spacemen and a man from Detroit in a\n\t\t\tpink satin Budgie Jacket. Masters of Budvar - all right, it doesn't make sense, but you know\n\t\t\tyou need it all the same.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNext month <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> headlines with his band The Moon Children, featuring Rob Bray, Misery\n\t\t\tWilson and Sarah Spade among others.

Wilson officially retired from active service and Agent\n\t\t\tCooper inescapably embroiled in a nationwide roll-out of new, improved\n\t\t\tagricultural software, the remaining Wilson Four resolve to travel in\n\t\t\tstyle for this trip to the West Country. Since we are all set to borrow\n\t\t\tback line amps from Applecraft, we really have very little luggage, so\n\t\t\twe ask to rent a car, rather than our usual van. What we end up with is\n\t\t\ta magnificent new Chrysler MPV with automatically retracting wing\n\t\t\tmirrors. For MC Bot this is love at first sight.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe set off mid-afternoon in bright sunshine and reach Oxford\n\t\t\teffortlessly. Somewhere on the road to Swindon Bot and I discover the\n\t\t\tunder-seat heating and laugh like delighted infants as our bums grow\n\t\t\tever toastier. Then, just as we hit the M4 south of Swindon, it begins\n\t\t\tto snow. \"Are people driving like c****s yet?\" inquires Stevie G from\n\t\t\tthe back seat.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFrom the centre of NN1 to the edge of Bath takes us two hours. >From\n\t\t\tthe edge of Bath to Moles Club takes us another hour. People are indeed\n\t\t\tdriving like c***s: when, that is, they bother to drive at all. We\n\t\t\teventually arrive at the club to find a bemused member of staff milling\n\t\t\tabout on her own. She tells us that there is no promoter, no soundman,\n\t\t\tno Applecraft. They are all Out There somewhere, lost in the snow. A\n\t\t\tphone call to Jon Mattock reveals that the Applecraft bus is trapped in\n\t\t\ta tragi-comic ballet of incompetent school-run drivers, sliding around\n\t\t\ton the many and fearsome hills of Bristol. There is nothing for it. We\n\t\t\thead for the pub.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe grab a beer and a bite to eat. Meanwhile, down in the club, the\n\t\t\tsound man has arrived. To my delight I spend ten whole minutes alone\n\t\t\twith him, making alliances for the future. We check out our backing\n\t\t\ttracks on the PA, just in case there isn't time for a sound check. Good\n\t\t\tthinking, as it will turn out.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI am milling about in the street outside the club, talking to Dave\n\t\t\tFrancolini on the phone. There is a very young guy with some kind of\n\t\t\torthopaedic stick, hanging around by the club door. As I head back into\n\t\t\tthe club, he stops me at the steps. \"Could you catch me if I fall?\" he\n\t\t\tasks. No problem; I wait as he negotiates the steep little stone steps\n\t\t\tinto the club. \"Thanks,\" he says, \"I'm Greg, the promoter.\" Just as\n\t\t\twell that I was in a helpful mood, then.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA local support band appears. They are called Eftus Septun (I think)\n\t\t\tand they are total rustic mental headcases. They tell us that, if\n\t\t\tApplecraft fail to make it, we can use their backline. One of their\n\t\t\tguitar amps is so old that it looks like they found it in a barn. It is\n\t\t\tbut a small comfort.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe repair to the Chrysler to smoke and play Black Sabbath 4. What an\n\t\t\textraordinary mix of great musicianship and utter ineptitude it truly\n\t\t\tis! There's one little break where the guitarist doesn't even attempt\n\t\t\tto get his part right - in fact, it sounds to me as if he doesn't even\n\t\t\tknow what notes he is trying to play; he just wants this bit over with.\n\t\t\tSo he piles on through, hopelessly splashing a few notes around and\n\t\t\thoping for the best. But - hey! - it's all right. The rest of the band\n\t\t\tare so monged out on red wine and shit that they don't even notice.\n\t\t\tIncredible!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSomewhere the wrong side of 8:00 o'clock, Applecraft finally appear.\n\t\t\tJon and Mike Mooney have spent more than six hours trying to drive the\n\t\t\t15 miles from Bristol to Bath. We are awful pleased to see them and\n\t\t\thang around while they set up and soundcheck. There's no time for us to\n\t\t\tcheck too, but at least I get to spend five minutes checking out the\n\t\t\tguitar amp that I shall be using for the next two days.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThings are set and ready to go. We pile back into the Chrysler and\n\t\t\tlisten to Evil Heat as we watch the punters filing down to the club. To\n\t\t\treach the door they have to pass down a flight of stone steps. Of\n\t\t\tcourse, these steps are covered in snow and well slippy. One by one we\n\t\t\twatch the punters trying to negotiate these stairs, and it is\n\t\t\tentertainment of the highest class. Within minutes we are all trying to\n\t\t\tpredict the next one to take a tumble...and when the next one duly\n\t\t\tdoes, hilarity erupts. It must be a bit of a shock for John Punter to\n\t\t\thear a sudden burst of savage and triumphant laughter from what only\n\t\t\tmoments ago appeared to be a parked and empty vehicle across the\n\t\t\tstreet. This, of course, just makes us laugh even harder. Later, as we\n\t\t\ttake the stage, Bot will tell them: \"You're already the most\n\t\t\tentertaining audience we've ever had.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe catch the end of Eftus Septun, or whatever they're called. It is\n\t\t\tutterly mental. Mad, discordant, scuttling crab-dancing music,\n\t\t\tdelivered in unbelievably short bursts. All three of the rustic\n\t\t\theadcases can really play, but they are freely squandering their\n\t\t\ttalents on playing this itchy-scratchy Frank Zappa garbage. Bot later\n\t\t\traises the possibility that maybe they were \"trying to do a US Maple\n\t\t\tsort of thing.\" Well, perhaps they were. I always found US Maple\n\t\t\tunlistenable too. Still, they are all very nice, friendly, helpful\n\t\t\tblokes, who trim their guitar strings in a neat and tidy fashion.\n\t\t\tWeird. Must be a village thing.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe next band, Milf, are much more of a mainstream operation;\n\t\t\tstandard-issue sub-Radiohead indie angst, with really, really horrid\n\t\t\tsinging. I hide in the dungeon-like dressing room (ambient temperature\n\t\t\tTen Below) and smoke frenziedly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe next thing you know, the opening drones of Police Chief are ringing\n\t\t\tacross the dancefloor. As the beats kick in, dancing breaks out. Fists\n\t\t\tpunch the air. Bot and I start shouting. The Wilson Four are in effect.\n\t\t\tHalf way through the set my guitar loses all power. Figuring that it\n\t\t\tmust be something along the line of effects that has gone down, I pull\n\t\t\tmy lead out and plug directly into the amp. For the rest of the set I\n\t\t\tam obliged constantly to zip over to the amp to change the settings.\n\t\t\tIt's busy work, and I make the occasional rather loud mistake with the\n\t\t\tamp, but quite quickly this leads to a somewhat carefree attitude with\n\t\t\tthe feedback and I am soon having a bit of a night. Steve responds to\n\t\t\tthis and we become a sort of scary goth funk band for twenty minutes.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe moment that we finish Buffalo Sniper, we are packing up and making\n\t\t\troom for Applecraft. As soon as all my kit is safely back in the\n\t\t\toubliette - sorry, \"dressing room\" - I am in motion again. I seek out\n\t\t\tthe promoter, who is beaming and saying things like \"Groovy!\" I'm\n\t\t\tpleased about this, but what I need to know is where I can find a cash\n\t\t\tmachine. He sets me on the path and out of the club I go; out onto the\n\t\t\tstreet, round the corner, down the hill, turn right, hit the machine,\n\t\t\tback up the hill and into the club. I find my way to the quiet upstairs\n\t\t\tbar, order a drink and ask where I can find a cigarette machine. I get\n\t\t\tthe right change from the bartender. I find and negotiate the cigarette\n\t\t\tmachine. Then, as Applecraft start up, I sit down next to Misery and -\n\t\t\tfifteen minutes after coming off stage - finally light my fag. It is\n\t\t\tone of The Great Cigarettes of the Modern Age.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo - Applecraft. Here is a band that epitomises the strange but\n\t\t\tenduring relationship between the musicians of Northampton and Bristol.\n\t\t\tJon Mattock, the drummer, and bassist Adrian Utley are both Northampton\n\t\t\tborn and raised. The others are Bristol-based: Mike Mooney (guitarist,\n\t\t\tsinger), Mike Crawford (guitarist), Sean Cook (harmonica) and Don\n\t\t\tMiranda (the singer). The musicians have a ridiculous pedigree\n\t\t\tinvolving Julian Cope, Echo & The Bunnymen, Spacemen 3, The Perfect\n\t\t\tDisaster, Spiritualised, Portishead and Goldfrapp. Not to mention the\n\t\t\tfact that Adrian used to play in celebrated NN1 soul band The Army\n\t\t\t(alongside a youthful Alex Green, as it goes). Applecraft have 2 albums\n\t\t\tout on Ochre Records: \"The Shining City On The Hill\" and \"The Happiest\n\t\t\tMan Alive\", which is newly released and the hook on which they are\n\t\t\thanging these shows.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTheir confident, professional musicianship is immediately apparent,\n\t\t\teven though this is their first show together. Jon, of course, is such\n\t\t\tan inspirational drummer that he lifts any group with which he plays.\n\t\t\tMooney is certainly responding, and although Adrian doesn't always seem\n\t\t\tto know quite where the song is going next, his rich and powerful bass\n\t\t\tstill does just what it's supposed to do. The sound is rich and\n\t\t\tmelodic, but it has a sort of seventies quality that makes me think of\n\t\t\tBadfinger or Free. Not what I was expecting, but fine anyway.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI have a very pleasant conversation with a nice man from Ochre Records\n\t\t\tand two disctinctly odd conversations with two different young men, one\n\t\t\tof whom thinks I look like Brian Ferry, the other of whom appears to\n\t\t\tbelive that I am Brian Ferry. As the club closes up we grab a bunch of\n\t\t\tbeer and jump into the Chrysler for the drive to Bristol, which, I am\n\t\t\thappy to report, took nothing like six hours. We head back to Mike\n\t\t\tMooney's place and pass a very agreeable few hours drinking and smoking\n\t\t\tthere before rolling up in our bedding and going to sleep."},{"gigtext_id":478,"datetime":"2004-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Mike Mooney and Jon Mattock from Lupine Howl have another band, called Applecraft.\n\t\t\tHaving just put out their debut album , \"The Happiest Man Alive\" (Ochre Records - OCHO43LCD), they are going\n\t\t\tout to play a few dates.

It, by all Dave's account, a dark and emotionally\n\t\t\tharrowing affair. Not many pretty tunes, like. Dave has been listening\n\t\t\tto a lot of Joy Division. And you can tell how much time that he and\n\t\t\tTony have spent working together in the studio. They practically finish\n\t\t\teach other's sentences. We eat ludicrous, fashionable food in the\n\t\t\trestaurant courtyard until incipent frostbite sends us scurrying back\n\t\t\tto the Chrysler's heated seats. Despite Tony's excellent cartography,\n\t\t\twe still get lost on Mooney's street, so we ring Jonny and get him to\n\t\t\t\"talk us down\". Bot quickly notes the differences in our navigational\n\t\t\tstyles: \"Jon does cake shops for landmarks - Pat does pubs!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSafely back at Mooney's, we relax. Then comes a moment of disbelieving\n\t\t\tpanic when Jon rings to say that his van has died. Two or three phone\n\t\t\tcalls later, it turns out that the consummate professional has just let\n\t\t\this bus run out of gas. Relieved, Bot and Mooney take him petrol, while\n\t\t\twe get the kit together for sound check.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGetting your equipment into Bristol's Folk House involves climbing\n\t\t\tabout thirty steep concrete steps, making a U-turn and going back along\n\t\t\ta balcony some fifteen yards to the stage door. I do not envy\n\t\t\tApplecraft as they tote their enormous bass wardrobe up the stairs.\n\t\t\tInside there is a big, wooden room with a very small vocal PA. On the\n\t\t\twalls are posters for a forthcoming show by Julie Felix. The big,\n\t\t\twooden room is strewn with tastefully arranged chairs and tables. It\n\t\t\tmakes me nervous. Bot is travelling down with Mooney. Steve, Kath and I\n\t\t\tload our stuff in, then, while The Craft essay a soundcheck, we head\n\t\t\tfor the Hatchet Inn.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Hatchet Inn claims to be one of the oldest surviving pubs in\n\t\t\tEngland, dating back to fifteen-something. It is certainly one of the\n\t\t\thardest pubs to get into. We skirt around its exterior for some time\n\t\t\twithout finding any door; then, as we round the beer garden (protected\n\t\t\tby hefty wrought iron railings), we find ourselves in a small urban\n\t\t\twind tunnel. A short struggle up here and we gain entrance. We sit down\n\t\t\tto a peaceful bite to eat and a drink.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBack at the Folk House, the Craft are struggling with the classic \"Big\n\t\t\tRoom - Little PA\" interface. Mike Crawford goes whizzing around Bristol\n\t\t\tat dizzying speeds to lay his hands on various items of kit. We mill\n\t\t\tabout, quietly wondering whether we will even be able to attempt a set\n\t\t\tthrough the system that they have here. Eventually we get a soundcheck\n\t\t\tand eventually we even have a reasonable sound. Much patience all round\n\t\t\tand eventual satisfaction. Midway through our check the Langley\n\t\t\tbrothers show up, but by the time we have got things right they are\n\t\t\tgone again. I set out towards the street to see if I can find them, but\n\t\t\tinstead I run into Syd and Anna Meats up from Romsey, so then it's back\n\t\t\tto the bar for draft Budvar and pancake recipes (this last bit really\n\t\t\tfloats MC Bot's boat).\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGerard Langley reappears, minus John, who's gone home for a nice night\n\t\t\tin. \"He's not that sociable really,\" offers Gerard, not entirely\n\t\t\tconvincingly. Gerard reveals to us that our soundman is his current\n\t\t\tbass player. Oh yes, and the bartender is his guitarist. Truly, we are\n\t\t\tall Gerard's ducks. The great Joe Allen stumbles by, bent on\n\t\t\tpoetry-related mayhem. Gabriel and Joe (no relation) are up from\n\t\t\tExeter. It's a nice vibration.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter a set of gospel dementia from a man whom I only know as Jesse (he\n\t\t\tis, to be fair, a rightly celebrated fixture on the Bristol scene and a\n\t\t\tphenomenally gifted guitar player), we get onstage at about a quarter\n\t\t\tto ten. The room is hardly heaving, but all the chairs are taken up and\n\t\t\tthere is a reasonable crowd. The fact that they are sitting down in\n\t\t\tthis nice, big wooden room is pretty disconcerting, mind. Stevie G\n\t\t\tlater declares this the weirdest gig that he has ever done. \"They just\n\t\t\tsort of sat there and looked at you.\" He's right. There's hardly a\n\t\t\trocking atmosphere, and the lighting is pretty funny too. My equipment\n\t\t\tis working properly tonight, at least. We deliver our set (the same as\n\t\t\tlast night) to a reasonable response, but nothing really catches fire.\n\t\t\tIn a situation like this we miss Agent Wilson and his percussion. The\n\t\t\tset is all quite competent, but we can't really get any vibrations\n\t\t\tgoing, making our little noise in this big, wooden room. Still, I can't\n\t\t\tsay that I didn't enjoy it, honking and blatting away up there. In some\n\t\t\tways it was an improvement on Bath, but we missed having the people\n\t\t\tnear us, leaping about.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy the way, while we're on the subject of weird gigs, might I just\n\t\t\tpoint out that it was Steve Gordon who, a few short years ago, booked\n\t\t\tus into a gig at a roller skating rink, where the audience came at you\n\t\t\tdownhill at about fifteen miles per hour in an endless stream?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOnce our kit is offstage and out of the way, a very portentous\n\t\t\tgentleman comes onstage and tells us all to shut up because now there's\n\t\t\tgoing to be a poet and she's going to be very good. I pack my kit bag\n\t\t\tin nervous silence, occasionally looking up to see if MC Bot has\n\t\t\tsuccumbed to the giggles yet. Kit safely stowed, we leave the punters\n\t\t\tto their culture and make a bee-line for the bar.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy now the place is filling up, and there are lots of good old faces to\n\t\t\tbe seen. Angelo Bruschini is in the house; Paul Wigens (who plays in a\n\t\t\tband called Grand Drive with two Wilson brothers!) is here; Franco and\n\t\t\tTony have turned up, saying nice things about our band; Pat Duff, late\n\t\t\tof Strangelove, is here, looking fantastic. Apparently he's been making\n\t\t\ta record with Alex Lee. Well, as ideas go, I'd say that was a good one.\n\t\t\tTo be honest, there's that much of a party feeling going off that I\n\t\t\tdon't see too much of Applecraft's set. What I do see sounds\n\t\t\tsurprisingly good, given the technical situation, and goes down well.\n\t\t\tAn easy home win for The Craft. \"Wait till we get you at home,\" we\n\t\t\ttaunt them.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt closing time we board the Chrysler.

To the sounds of the\n\t\t\tFun Loving Criminals and The Stranglers we speed effortlessly through\n\t\t\tthe night, arriving back at my front door at a scarcely credible\n\t\t\thalf-past-two.

We make arrangements for Applecraft to use our backline\n\t\t\tkit and decide that, if they are going to be late, we might as well\n\t\t\tsoundcheck first. This we duly do, and we are just finishing up when\n\t\t\tthe Bristol massive arrives.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI'm talking to Adrian Utley about Northampton, explaining that I live\n\t\t\tjust around the corner from the club, near Colwyn Road. He says that he\n\t\t\tused to live on Colwyn road, in one of those big old houses that back\n\t\t\tonto the Racecourse. \"Oh yes,\" I say, \"They're nice houses, those.\" He\n\t\t\tlooks at me as though I have taken final leave of my senses. Of course,\n\t\t\the knew Colwyn Road years ago, before the property developers and kids\n\t\t\twith sports cars moved in, back when it was the P.I. capital of\n\t\t\tNorthamptonshire. I feel forced to tell him that we shan't be much\n\t\t\tolder before the first pavement cafe appears on Colwyn Road.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy the time that The Craft have acquainted themselves with our kit and\n\t\t\tcome to terms with the \"Little Room - Big PA\" interface, the room is\n\t\t\talready filling with punters. Somebody says to me \"I thought you were\n\t\t\tgoing to play first.\" Max Eider (for it is he), MC Bot and I take off\n\t\t\tfor a quick veggie burger and a smoke round at Shakespeare Villas.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe return to find the room chock full of people, with a faintly\n\t\t\tagitated DJ Andy keen for us to get on and get started. With unnerving\n\t\t\tspeed we do exactly that. We have the Agent back tonight, and any swing\n\t\t\tthat was missing in Bristol is back with a vengeance. We start with\n\t\t\tQuality People and Critters. The sound is good and strong and we're\n\t\t\tplaying well. I am, I must confess, having one of my Loud Nights. The\n\t\t\taudience are really warm and responsive (what else can they honestly do\n\t\t\twith us crammed in their faces like this?) and we race through the best\n\t\t\tset of the three, finishing with Dark Agenda. The set has been a\n\t\t\tsuccess. Andy Skank does something that nobody has ever done before. He\n\t\t\tcalls our sound \"sexy\"!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tUpstairs in the Keir Hardie Room, which has been temporarily\n\t\t\tre-assigned the Dressing Room, I meet Olga. Olga comes from the Czech\n\t\t\tRepublic and would appear to be some kind of music journalist. She has\n\t\t\tbravely travelled up from London on her own to see Applecraft, and now\n\t\t\tshe wants to know what I do in the band. I have to explain that she has\n\t\t\tjust missed the chance to see what it is I do.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOlga is concerned about the security of her bag. I assure her that it\n\t\t\twill be fine up here, out of the way.\n\t\t\t\"Put it under a coat or something, if you want, love.\"\n\t\t\t\"Yes...that is what I did in Sheffield and they stole my bag there.\"\n\t\t\tI try to explain that people in Sheffield are dangerous desperados and\n\t\t\tthat NN1 is altogether more chilled, but she is having none of it. She\n\t\t\tremoves a cassette tape, on which she has recorded an interview with\n\t\t\tthe Undertones, and puts it in her pocket. Then she scoops up a box of\n\t\t\tApplecraft records and heads downstairs into the throng, bent on sales.\n\t\t\tI pack up and rejoin Max and Kathie in the hot and crowded bar just as\n\t\t\tThe Craft are kicking off. This time I get to see pretty much the whole\n\t\t\tof their set, and very fine it is too, a quantum leap from the previous\n\t\t\ttwo (just like us, I suppose). The core of Jonny, Adrian and Mooney is\n\t\t\traging. Having had trouble making himself heard at the soundcheck,\n\t\t\tMooney employs the Turn-It-Up-To-Eleven approach and sprays the bar\n\t\t\twith wild psychedelic lead guitar. Jonny goes mental. This in turn\n\t\t\tinspires Mooney to do something even more ludicrous. And so it goes on\n\t\t\tfor forty-five minutes until they drive the truck into the wall on a\n\t\t\tlittle thing called \"Quo Country\"! Mooney is standing on an amp,\n\t\t\tgrinning like a maniac and playing the bass for reasons known only to\n\t\t\thim. Adrian Utley is attacking his guitar in a profoundly un-Portishead\n\t\t\tsort of a way. The sound is phenomenal, as loud as the building can\n\t\t\tstand, and the players are making it only too clear how and why they\n\t\t\tacquired that ludicrous pedigree. It's a bravura display of lush,\n\t\t\tmuscular psychedelic rock and roll, which leaves everybody in the house\n\t\t\tsoaking wet and grinning like a fool.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMost of the Craft are heading back to Bristol. Jonny is coming to the\n\t\t\tWilson party at Misery's place just up the road. So, it turns out, is\n\t\t\tOlga, for it is late now and Misery has offered her a room for the\n\t\t\tnight. The trouble lies in actually getting Olga from the Labour Club\n\t\t\tto Misery's yard. \"Go with Pat,\" Mooney urges her, \"He'll see you all\n\t\t\tright.\" Olga looks at Mooney. She looks at me. Then she looks at Mooney\n\t\t\tagain. Her brow is troubled. \"I don't which one is scarier - you or\n\t\t\thim,\" she says.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tEventually, with a lot of help from Kathie McGinty, we convince Olga\n\t\t\tthat she is not about to be sold into the white slave trade, and she\n\t\t\tand her bag finally follow us back to a splendid party, where her\n\t\t\tdiffidence vanishes upon contact with Misery's record collection. As\n\t\t\tBrian said when I saw him a day or so later: \"That was a good old\n\t\t\tnight. I don't remember how I got home.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe still don't know for sure whether MC Bot ever gave them back their\n\t\t\tChrysler."},{"gigtext_id":482,"datetime":"2004-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"I have accidentally been put in charge of the Acoustic Allstars night, first Friday\n\t\t\tof every month at the Labour Club, charles Street, NN1, free to get in, Budvar now on sale at socialist\n\t\t\tprices.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor Friday 6th February we can offer:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Curtis E.

Andy Skank has brought a lovely little PA system into the Labour Club. Nice\n\t\t\tand easy - no mess, no pins, no fuss. There were red candles on all the tables and we played Rachid Taha, John\n\t\t\tMartin, Tim Keegan and the Electric Gypsyland album as people came in and sorted out their various drinking needs.\n\t\t\tAndy showed me the Secret Door and what it's for. Oh yes, doors really do open when you're an Organiser. We lurked\n\t\t\tin the eaves of the club and admired a small sporting trophy that had been concealed there.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> is first up. I've seen Joe a few times before. I really like what he does, but he freaks me out because\n\t\t\tof his extraordinary resemblance to the young Kevin Ayers. A tall, skinny, cheeky white bloke singing the blues, Joe\n\t\t\tcharms the audience from the start. He's borrowed Curtis' guitar too, so for the first time he doesn't have to worry\n\t\t\tabout keeping the instrument near the microphone, on account of it's already plugged into the PA direct. The result\n\t\t\tis easily the best sound I have heard Joe have. Splendid stuff. No fighting or anything. Marvellous.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen it's time for Fat Bloke Karaoke. I have my Burns in my lap and my DAT player by my side. I'm all set to screw\n\t\t\tshit up royally. Soon there will be howls of \"Judas\" from the acoustic music fans. Soon the management will be\n\t\t\tasking \"Is that all he does?\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn fact, just for a moment, it appears that I may not even be going to get that far. The DAT takes an alarmingly\n\t\t\tlong time to roll, but when it does I'm off on a wing and a prayer and a Fun Lovin' Criminals sample. I play:\n\t\t\tOut Of Touch\n\t\t\tRadio Saigon\n\t\t\tA new song, which is currently - and terrifyingly - called \"Brian Wilson\"\n\t\t\tScarlett\n\t\t\tand\n\t\t\tIndian Summer.\n\t\t\tDespite the fact that the new tune is a complete and utter dirge, it all goes down remarkably well. I make a few\n\t\t\tscrew-ups on the guitar, but nothing too ghastly. I think that Fat Bloke Karaoke may be around for a while to come.\n\t\t\tOh, it's not really called Fat Bloke Karaoke. It's called \"Pat Fish\". For the moment anyway. You know, I rather like\n\t\t\tFat Bloke Karaoke.\n\t\t\tWith the fat bloke duly unplugged comes the first appearance of Ghost Train. Steve Gordon, Ian Anderson and Kathy\n\t\t\tSchaer park themselves on stools on the stage. The gentlemen have acoustic guitars, the lady a big old acoustic\n\t\t\tbass. There is not so much as a microphone anywhere near them. \"We're Ghost Train, and we play acoustic music,\" says\n\t\t\tsoftly-spoken Steve, and it begins to dawn on the punters that if they want to catch any of this stuff they had\n\t\t\tbetter shut the feck up. Wonderfully, after a little shooshing, the crowded club really does fall silent as Ghost\n\t\t\tTrain open up with a beautifully authentic western swing instrumental. The room watches entranced as Kath sings a\n\t\t\tlonesome prairie sort of cowboy song, another perky wee instrumental flashes by and they are gone, to thunderous\n\t\t\tapplause. Lovely music, properly played. And it's free to get in, for Heaven's sakes.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSteve later told me that he hadn't realised quite how quiet the band were going to sound in a club situation.\n\t\t\tNothing that a couple of well-placed overhead mics won't fix next time.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs the Budvar flowed, Curtis E. Johnson picked up a guitar in public for the first time in an age. Picking\n\t\t\tdeliberately through every nuance of the spicey little minor chord sequence, he opened up with The Harlem Hamfats\n\t\t\tclassic \"Weed Smoker's Dream\". Rough and tough, we couldn't get enough. We got Big Jake, we got that tune about\n\t\t\tmining in outer space, we got a sublime version of \"Breathe\", we got a rare and precious version of the Boris\n\t\t\tYeltsin song, we got songs about repression in Guatemala and we got songs about Cullen Skink. Best of all, we got a\n\t\t\tcompletely unexpected and utterly riveting rendition of Brian Eno's \"The Fat Lady Of Limbourg\". Unforgettable!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo that was my first attempt at Acoustic Allstars. Nobody got hurt, everybody got paid. Tidy. The next one will be\n\t\t\ton Friday 5th March at the Labour Club once again, and I'll pass on details of the bill when it's finalised. Until\n\t\t\tthen, thanks to all at the Labour Club, to Andy Skank, to all the artists and to all the people who came and\n\t\t\tlistened. We love you."},{"gigtext_id":484,"datetime":"2004-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Friday 2nd July sees a long, cool draught of electro-acoustic intoxicants across three distinct genres.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOur headliner - and this is a bit of a coup for us - is Ramon de Juan.\n\t\t\tRaised in Benidorm's infamous nightclub district, Ramon moved to the UK during the eighties, where he became\n\t\t\tinvolved in the electro scene and developed an irrational fondness for Adam and the Ants. Later, inspired by\n\t\t\tthe Stone Roses and Throwing Muses, Ramon picked up a guitar and started writing songs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tToday he plays hypnotically beautiful music with shimmering, clean guitars and atmospheric keyboard washes.\n\t\t\tSigned to the painfully cool Fishsoup Records (run by Bic Hayes, the \"other\" Pet Shop Boys guitarist), Ramon\n\t\t\thas recently completed his first album with ace producer Choque Hosein of Black Star Liner at the controls. For\n\t\t\tfans of modern European songwriting and ambient chill-out alike.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor a sneak preview, try to imagine a blissed-out Curtis E. Johnson crossed with the most extravagantly\n\t\t\tmelancholic moments of early Roxy Music; it might give you a bit of a headache, but you won't be far off the\n\t\t\tmark. Gorgeous, at any rate, and worth seeing before the Meeja get ahold of him and drive him up out of our\n\t\t\tprice range!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSupporting Ramon will be Northampton's own Spittle Rattle. SpitRat mainman Michael Holloway is a veteran of the\n\t\t\twild scene down at Slurps in the nineties and is widely admired around town as a master of cracked folk-blues\n\t\t\tballads. He has also played in Germany, Switzerland and France. Accompanying himself on guitar and backed up by\n\t\t\tPaul Williams (Ubu Swirl) on bass, he delivers a set of depth, intensity and granite-black gallows humour. Fans\n\t\t\tof Jeff Buckley, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Nick Drake, the Velvets and Spiritualised should make this a date. As\n\t\t\tshould you.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOpening the bill is Pat Fish (The Jazz Butcher/Wilson) continuing his bizarre project of revising his back\n\t\t\tcatalogue in a psychedelic karaoke style. Something like an older version of Simple Kid - without the charm,\n\t\t\tbut with more software and a busload of larcenous beats. With each and every one of his Masters of Budvar sets\n\t\t\tspecially and exclusively devised for that night only, a couple of ill-advised cover versions do tend to turn\n\t\t\tup during programming, so expect big dumb songs and big dumb surprises.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd there it is. Entry is free. The first act will be on at about 9:00 o'clock. We have cheap beer, pretty\n\t\t\tlights and a lovely PA.\n\t\t\tFor we are Masters of Budvar, doing it for love.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t<b>Excerpts from a review of Ramon de Juan's first EP written by Sam Saunders, Leeds Music Scene</b>\n\t\t\t<i>\n\t\t\tIt is an exquisite piece of work.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's so much more than just mood music. Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your thing. But you have to\n\t\t\tstand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst yourself\n\t\t\twith joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere are some distant FX guitar touches and the lightest of electronic suggestions. It fades deliciously away,\n\t\t\tleaving a nostalgic and lonesome feeling as piano notes fall like gentle touches of silk. It is beautiful.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt isn't rock and roll, but it could save your love life.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFour and a half stars\n\t\t\t</i>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>"},{"gigtext_id":485,"datetime":"2004-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Great night at the Labour Club again last night.

I'm uncertain\n\t\t\tas to the significance of this shouting, but I'm working on the basis that it is in some way supposed to be\n\t\t\tfriendly. Welcome to the Acoustic Tendency's Little Day Out.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe trip has been organised by Stevie Gordon, and it involves the cream of the Cafe Veranda scene, Ghost Train,\n\t\t\t<a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> and Robert Bray, along with an ageing headcase with an electric guitar and DAT player. The Oakley\n\t\t\tArms has a neat little venue upstairs called the Attic. The Vibrators are playing there soon. I shall go and\n\t\t\tsee them, for Knox is cool. But we are not playing in The Attic; we are playing in the bar downstairs. A small\n\t\t\tPA is set up and the scary natives who were occupying the appointed \"stage\" area somehow relinquish their\n\t\t\tplaces on the sofa there to let us set up.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSeizing the moment, I dive up, plant my amp on the sofa and commit some kind of sound check. Everything seems\n\t\t\tto be working, so I head back out into the car park. This is my big mistake. Andy Skank beckons me into his\n\t\t\tmotor, where he, Joe and I sit and smoke. The Carter Family and the Be Good Tanyas are on the car stereo, which\n\t\t\tseems appropriate. What is a little bit stranger is that as we sit there, we can see (but not hear) Robert Bray\n\t\t\tand Kath Schaer practicing a tune on a bench right in front of us. Most confusing.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe only have a little smoke, but as soon as we step out of the car, it's clear that there is going to be\n\t\t\ttrouble. There are two doors into the pub. One of them is open, the other sports a large sign saying \"No Entry.\n\t\t\tStaff Only. Never, ever even try to come in through this door, fool.\" Joe lurches straight for the latter door.\n\t\t\tWe have, it transpires, just smoked the Spliff Of No Return...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tInside again I buy myself a Stella Artois at prices that wouldn't seem out of place in the West End of London\n\t\t\tand chat with Tim Coley the film maker, who is telling me that Natacha Atlas has just bought herself a cave in\n\t\t\tAndalusia. Kathy turns up with a big bag of chips: \"Hang onto these for me, will you?\" I imagine that she's\n\t\t\tjust going up to do a sound check. Wrong. This is Ghost Train in full effect; this is The Set. Kath's chips are\n\t\t\tdelicious. They don't help to sober me up, though.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGhost Train put in the best show that they have played yet. Steve's vocals are stronger and more confident than\n\t\t\tever before, and the playing is well on the money. It's easy to be distracted by Portugal playing Spain on the\n\t\t\t(happily silent) TV by the bar, but they hold the attention and turn in a delightful bunch of tunes. I still\n\t\t\thave a few chips left to hand back to Kath when they finish.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNext comes Joe. Boy, I begin to see what that smoke can do to a man! Out of tune for \"I Want You\", Joe\n\t\t\tnonetheless manages to hold it together for the rest of his set, until it comes time to introduce his rather\n\t\t\tlovely song \"Waiting For Emily\". Joe's got some kind of idea for a funny joke in his head: a pun on \"Weighting\n\t\t\tfor Emily\" - tragically, he can't actually find the words to explain this to the punters. Handicapped by the\n\t\t\tfact that he has made himself laugh with the idea, Joe struggles to share it, laughing harder all the time.\n\t\t\tHe's borderline hysterical. And, you know what? I know just how he feels.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOh, did I mention that they're making me play last? I don't know how much more of this reassuringly expensive\n\t\t\tStella I can take and still hold my shit together.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRobert Bray steps up and does his thing. Steve and I agree that we hate him. He's just too blinking good.\n\t\t\tProper songwriting and a fantasic guitar picking technique. Beastly man! Kathy joins him on bass for a couple\n\t\t\tof tunes and does really well. Whisper it, but Kath is becoming something of a star in Acoustic World. There\n\t\t\tare a few punters in the room now (although all the provincial nu-metal kids have taken refuge in the beer\n\t\t\tgarden out the back) and they show a proper appreciation for Rob's efforts. He goes down really well, which is\n\t\t\tno more than this disgustingly talented man deserves.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt some point, while introducing a tune, Rob decides out loud: \"Bah! I should work in marketing.\"\n\t\t\tQuick as a flash, joe shouts back: \"Is that near Kettering?\"\n\t\t\tMost appropriate.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd then it's my turn. I've failed to sober up, and I'm well discombobulated by that, let me tell you. Still,\n\t\t\tit's a nice easy version of Out Of Touch to start with, so off I go. That's when the natives start bellowing. I\n\t\t\tstart Radio Saigon, they start shouting \"Pink Floyd!\" I don't mind, but it sure is weird. Ghosts next, which\n\t\t\tgoes well, then a version of Shakey whereupon I manage to play three wrong chords in a row: \"I've seen pigs die\n\t\t\twith more dignity\" is what I tell them. Then I completely fluff the intro to \"Stop This City\" and go steaming\n\t\t\tthrough \"Tread Water\" with only the flimsiest of connections to the backing track. Stamp on the fuzztone (See?\n\t\t\tThis is what becomes of your Acoustic Night!) It goes down a treat, not least with Stevie G, who can't believe\n\t\t\tI just did a De La Soul number. Well, he has got a point.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere follows a swift pack-up and soon we are all back in Andy's motor, speeding towards NN1 and the Racehorse.\n\t\t\tFor while the Oakley Arms closes at 10:30 of a Sunday evening, our Abington Square headquarters will be\n\t\t\tcontinuing to trade until midnight.

After a couple\n\t\t\tof appearances at the Cafe Veranda's wednesday night acoustic sessions, they played with calm and confidence.\n\t\t\tThey were rewarded with plenty of attention and applause, except for one noisy soul who just couldn't keep it\n\t\t\tall in. He was like that Cat Stevens, in fact: he had to let it out.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis he continued to do through the first couple of numbers from the sharp-suited Micky Greaney.\n\t\t\tThen Micky caught him out applauding a tune.\n\t\t\t\"What are you clapping for?\" he enquired, \"You haven't listened to a note of it.\"\n\t\t\tAnd then, with exactly the speed and grace of an entirely sober man moving to hit another man very hard, the\n\t\t\tdiminiutive songwriter heaved his microphone stand up into the air and planted it firmly in front of Mister\n\t\t\tNoisy.\n\t\t\t\"Tell you what - why don't I sing this one just for you, and we'll see if you can't shut up and listen for five\n\t\t\tminutes?\"\n\t\t\tYou guessed it. He shut up. Which enabled the rest of us to spend half an hour listening to the astonishing set\n\t\t\tthat Micky had come to play. A wonderful set of classic songwriting. The voice is everything I've been told and\n\t\t\ta bit more.\n\t\t\tSpecial thanks to John Purcell for suggesting him for a gig here in the first place, and for going way, way\n\t\t\tbeyond the call of duty in delivering him safely among us.

The Duke\n\t\t\tplayed electric bass and the twin guitar strikers span melodies, counter melodies, rhythms, polyrhythms,\n\t\t\tmultitap ping-pong poly-meta-rhythms and shit like that around the place like they had an urgent appointment to\n\t\t\tkeep. For a moment or two they searched around for the right sound, but by their second tune they were blazing.\n\t\t\tGreat musicians with great sounds playing Django jazz and a sort of mutated Latin bop at high speeds well loud.\n\t\t\tA marvellopus set that earned the band two encores, including a dreamy \"Nuages\" to close on. Marvellous.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy this stage the Masters of Budvar were in full physical control of my frame, so naturally I found myself\n\t\t\tcompelled to spend some time just veering around grinning like an eejit saying \"thank you\" to people.

And what is happening in Northampton? Why it's overrun with Germans - I love this town!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor this weekend it is Twinfest, where the bands from town get together with bands from our twin towns of\n\t\t\tPoitiers and Marburg with a view to putting on three days of loved-up rocking festivity, drunkenness and random\n\t\t\tacts of international kindness. Except that the poor old French people, struggling against government cutbacks\n\t\t\tat home, can't come this year. So it's just us and the Germans. I feel sorry for the French guys - mais\n\t\t\tnaturellement - but I can't help feeling how appropriate it is that Brits and Germans should be putting\n\t\t\ttogether this good natured international hoedown at a time when far too many people are reviving far too many\n\t\t\tpainful memories.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere are, of course, matters of physical endurance to consider at such affairs. After Masters of Budvar on\n\t\t\tFriday night and the ensuing suicide mission - sorry, party - Russ and I felt that, if Wilson were ever going\n\t\t\tto make it onstage for their appointed hour of Sunday lunchtime, we had better devise a Plan. We found\n\t\t\tourselves obliged to pick up our passes for the festival at a Twinfest gig in the Racehorse garden on Saturday.\n\t\t\tKnowing that we needed an early night before our set, we planned to nip down early in the evening, grab the\n\t\t\tpasses, get blind drunk by half-past-eight and hit the sack around nine or ten.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHalf past eight arrives and the Plan is working perfectly. Various members of Wilson are strewn around the pub\n\t\t\tgarden, passes safely secured, roaring drunkenly at the mighty Shiga Wire, Marburg's very own answer to\n\t\t\tMetallica. Only with Josh Homme for a lead singer. Yes, real good.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBut, reader, I am sure that by now you have spotted the Flaw in the Plan.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSeverely damaged and dressed in our best (just to show it off to maximum effect) we arrive at the pub. It is\n\t\t\t11:00am and the sun is shining down like you wouldn't believe. It is a glorious morning in NN1 and we are in no\n\t\t\tstate to appreciate it.\n\t\t\tOne of us has not even slept at all.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe make our way to the gates of Becket's Park, where a kindly soul in a yellow \"events\" tee shirt tells us that\n\t\t\twe can't bring our cars onto the festival site. Somewhere deep, deep inside me lurks a thought that (perhaps\n\t\t\thappily) I cannot physically articulate: we've only got ourselves into this lamentable state by making an\n\t\t\till-advised trip to the pub to pick up these STUPID GREAT CAR PASSES THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU ON OUR\n\t\t\tWINDSCREENS, MISTER C***Y. Patiently, and without making any panic calls on his Walky-Talky (it's the fecking\n\t\t\tDigital Revolution and these prats still have the same walky fecking talkies as they used to have in 1978.\n\t\t\tProbably handed down lovingly from father to son along with all those useless fecking post-punk Rough Trade\n\t\t\trecords, then, eh?) he explains to us: \"She said no cars on site after eleven thirty.\"\n\t\t\tIt is exactly eleven thirty two AM.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRuss disappears into the park to find the great \"She\" while Kathy and I mill about, trying to stay alive and\n\t\t\twatching despondently as some shaven-headed buffoons hack down trees in order to facilitate the building of\n\t\t\tmore flats for more vain and helpless Hollyoaks beings. Eventually Russ returns with a lady from the council,\n\t\t\twho graciously \"walks\" the car into the park. That's it. That's absolutely right. She walks along in front of\n\t\t\tthe car, just to let people know that it's on its way. \"If she really wants to recreate the golden early days\n\t\t\tof motoring,\" I ask Russ, \"Shouldn't she at least have the decency to carry a red flag?\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNobody dies and we make it to the backstage area.

You could have fitted them all right there on the stage with us. If they had been up there,\n\t\t\tperhaps they would have heard the beats, because, if SPT (Subsequent Punter Testimony) is anything to go by,\n\t\t\tthey never heard them out the front.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, yes, we banged away as best we could, and I guess we played all right; but it's all rather pointless if\n\t\t\tpeople out the front can't hear the drums.

Their first, self-released album Bop Art acted as a\n\t\t\tstatement of intent, and the band soon landed an album deal with Fire Records of London. After a clutch of increasingly successful\n\t\t\treleases with Fire, in 1989 the band signed to Ensign Records who brought major label muscle to the promotion of the phenomenal\n\t\t\tSwagger album, the Sunday Times album of the year. The follow-up Beat Songs, recorded in Los Angeles and released in 1991, garnered\n\t\t\tfurther success with the critics and the public alike, and The Blue Aeroplanes continued to tour Europe, North America and Japan\n\t\t\tthroughout the nineties.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the turn of the century, Langley started his own record label, Art Star, on which the Aeroplanes released their latest and possibly\n\t\t\tmost triumphantly deranged album, Cavaliers, in 2001. The following year Langley released his first solo album, Record Player,\n\t\t\trevealing his long-standing affection for the underground rock of the seventies alongside the usual high-octane brew of poetry, malice\n\t\t\tand mayhem. At the time of writing, a new Blue Aeroplanes album has just been completed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor this exclusive acoustic appearance, Langley will be joined by Blue Aeroplanes guitarist and singer, Rodney Allen. Before joining\n\t\t\tthe Aeroplanes, Rodney was a successful solo artist in his own right, and he still occasionally tours with his own band, the Rodney\n\t\t\tAllen Experience. Expect a night of wild lyricism and distressed twenty-first century folk music run riot\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOpening the show are two talented solo artists from Northampton.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBee Church is a bright and engaging songstress, who is making her first appearance at Masters of Budvar after successful sets at the\n\t\t\tStrumpets & Pluckers night at the Racehorse in Northampton and the Deportees Club at the Castle in Wellingborough.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPaul Cox is well-known on the local scene as an acoustic balladeer and man-about-town. His classic original songwriting recently\n\t\t\tentranced the crowds at Northampton's Balloon Festival.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMasters of Budvar is a monthly live music night at the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1. It takes place on the first\n\t\t\tFriday of every month and entry is always free of charge. There is a friendly atmosphere, very reasonably priced drinks and the best\n\t\t\tlittle sound system in town. For nine months now we have been presenting the cream of Northampton's original musical talent,\n\t\t\talong with guest artists from London, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Southampton.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt is a night not to be missed for all music lovers.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.blueaeroplanes.com\" target=\"new\">www.blueaeroplanes.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.paulmcox.com\" target=\"new\">www.paulmcox.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->"},{"gigtext_id":503,"datetime":"2004-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Mental Friday night, the place was stuffed. We discovered at 4:15 in the afternoon that Bee Church was, in fact, not\n\t\t\tin Northampton at all, but in Keele University. So Karaoke Bob here filled in, taking the first slot a bit rusty and\n\t\t\thoping for the best. There were some puzzled looking faces out there. Perhaps they had heard a word that this was to\n\t\t\tbe a \"properly\" acoustic night. Yes, well, sorry about that, but sometimes the \"properly\" acoustic artist is just to\n\t\t\tblooming flakey to turn up at their own gigs. Having long ago dispensed with further education, I cobbled together a\n\t\t\tset out of:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOut of Touch - Jazz Butcher Theme - Ghosts - Shakey - Stop This City - and Tread Water. People responded very kindly.\n\t\t\tPaul Cox's guitar was sounding splendid through Rodney's little Marshall combo with a line-out to the PA. Really warm\n\t\t\tand rich and just right. Paul sang hypnotically and I felt that his whole thing tonight had a sort of Spiritualised\n\t\t\tvibe to it. Not in any derivative way, just in the sort of concentration vibration. Lovely, anyway.\n\t\t\tGerard and Rodney were ever so game. They entered right into the spirit of things, unfazed by the venue or the PA or\n\t\t\tthe fact that I forced them to go on straight after \"Good Vibrations\". What was immediately apparent was just how good\n\t\t\ta rhythm guitarist Rodney Allen really is: tight, bright, energetic and accurate. And, of course, over the top of\n\t\t\tthat, a grown man with a handful of papers spouting inconceivable great gobbets of garbled information, bile,\n\t\t\twonderment and wit at breakneck speed. Rodney joining in for the choruses with his rich, warm voice. Oh, and plenty of\n\t\t\tthe old hits too, like Jacket Hangs (the best received tune of the night), Love Come Round, a storming Bury Your Love\n\t\t\tLike Treasure (some audience participation, possibly, on my part), The Applicant and Yr Own World; alongside odd bits\n\t\t\tand pieces like Jack Leaves from Beatsongs and even a couple of brand new numbers from the forthcoming Blue Aeropanes\n\t\t\talbum. Rodney delivered a ouple of tunes, one by the Great Paul Mulreaney, and one which - spinechillingly - turned\n\t\t\tout to be the awesome Disney Head. In the Labour Club. For nothing.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOnly time and an increasingly restless Geoff behind the bar put a stop to the fun and games. The crowd wanted more and\n\t\t\tthe talent were keen to lay a version of Tom Verlaine's Breaking In My Heart upon them, but it was not to be. Not this\n\t\t\ttime.\n\t\t\tInstead it's off to the boozer up the street until one o'clock, thence back to Shakespeare Villas for more\n\t\t\tfoolishness. Members of the Echo Chamber materialise at some deep hour of the night. I know I didn't imagine it. It\n\t\t\tgoes on until dawn.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNext month: The New Moon from Oxford, a modern acoustic trio with double bass; Northampton acoustic star Robert Bray\n\t\t\tand his circle of disgustingly talented friends; and a third act. It was going to be me, but, having done this month's\n\t\t\tgig, and having helped myself to the support for the Black Watch on the 22nd October, I think I might remove myself\n\t\t\tfrom the November Budvar bill and let somebody else have a go.

At the Cricket Club they are staging the first Tom\n\t\t\tHall Memorial Cricket-for-All Challenge Tournament. In Abington Park there is a Gay Pride knees-up with\n\t\t\tbands and stuff. I am sitting in an otherwise empty Racehorse bar, my Burns in my lap, struggling to free\n\t\t\tthe ball end of a broken 10 string from the body of the guitar. Normally this is a process for which I\n\t\t\twould employ the tiny allen-key in my gig bag, but right now my gig bag is at the Cricket club, helping to\n\t\t\tset up the PA. So, in need of some other slender but purposeful pokey item, I seize a 46 string and start\n\t\t\tto push away with that. Ninety seconds later, the 46 is trapped in the hole every bit as irredeemably as\n\t\t\tthe 10. I'm sitting in the middle of a pub at two o'clock in the afterbloodynoon with this guitar in\n\t\t\tmy lap, with wayward bits of wire poking out of it in all directions. Looks like it's going to be one\n\t\t\tof those days.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMisery collects me and my kit from the pub and we drive up to the Cricket Club. Inside Bot and Jamie Jab\n\t\t\thave made a marvellous job of setting up the PA. Everything is in readiness. But where are the drums? With\n\t\t\tAgent Cooper on holiday in Turkey, we had understood that Mr. Fletcher was keen to seize his opportunity to\n\t\t\tplay with Wilson. We'd been a bit nonplussed when he didn't show for rehearsal on Friday night.\n\t\t\t\"A bit cocky\" was the general verdict at the time; but Mr. Fletcher is a proper musician, and we figured\n\t\t\tthat as long as we were ready, he would hardly mess things up that much.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe hadn't figured on a no-show. \"A bit cocky\" is swiftly revised to read \"Bottled it.\" Stevie G makes\n\t\t\tthreats of violence, as is his way. I'm left pondering the point of saying \"yes\" to something when\n\t\t\twhat you really mean is \"I can't.\" I don't think I'll ever get my head round it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNo. N-O. Only got two letters, only takes a second to say it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThanks, Chuck D, for putting it quite so well.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo we have a large, empty space in the middle of the stage area. This corresponds in a rather sublime\n\t\t\tmanner with the vast empty space that is the rest of the room. Outside a game of cricket is taking place.\n\t\t\tOccasionally a voice breaks out of the PA system - commentating!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSomething else we hadn't figured on. The man who invited us to play said that we could play any time\n\t\t\tthat suited us. We had figured on 4 o'clock as being as good a time as any. The event is supposed to\n\t\t\tstop at 6 o'clock, so that seemed to be pitched about right. Gratifyingly, as 4 o'clock nears,\n\t\t\ta small crowd gathers in the room.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTrouble is this: it has become clear that there is to be no noisy old music while the cricket is being\n\t\t\tplayed. Can't be distracting the players, you see, even if we are about a hundred and fifty yards\n\t\t\taway from them, inside a building. So we are going to have to wait until the cricket is done. The final\n\t\t\tdoesn't finish until six o'clock. When I finally do enter the room to see about playing, I see\n\t\t\tthat 9031700475300f that small crowd has given up in despair and gone away again.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNever mind. At the last the cricket players will be there, keen to celebrate their winning the final,\n\t\t\tright? Well, yes. The trouble is this: the team that has just won the Tom Hall Memorial Cricket For All\n\t\t\tChallenge Tournament is a team from the Police. (Yes, indeed, that does explain why Curtis was out there on\n\t\t\tthe rainy terraces, cheering desperately for the other side.) So we have perhaps twenty-five people here to\n\t\t\tsee the band and perhaps potentially as many Police. And we have been waiting hours. We've waited in\n\t\t\tthe toilets, we've waited in Curtis' car, listening to - uh - opera, we've\n\t\t\twaited in the special \"Umpires Only\" room (backstage dumper! \"Hey, Bot - we should do a gig here some\n\t\t\ttime!\"), we've waited like proper waiters. Nuff waiting already, let us play.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe backing track begins to roll, with - appropriately enough - snatches of Police radio. I'm\n\t\t\twondering if anybody here recognises his voice. I'm wondering if we're all going to Guantanamo.\n\t\t\tWe start with Play It All Night Long, and there is venom. The programmed beats are coming back at us so\n\t\t\thard that my monitor is cracking up. It's a good, solid start. Critters is introduced as a song about\n\t\t\tnature. I'm sure that no animal noises of any kind were made by anybody. At this point.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe bash our way through Quality People, then Curtis runs on to join in with Istanbul Connection. He's\n\t\t\tbrought his own beer crate with him so that he can reach up to share my microphone, and makes a point of\n\t\t\tgetting down off it between lines, then getting back up again for the next one. He's a proper\n\t\t\tnuisance, but he's a lovely set of pipeys on him. By now there is a small posse of cricket police\n\t\t\tsitting at a table at the back, about as far away from the band as you can go, looking well miserable. I\n\t\t\thave no idea what they can be making of the ensuing Secret Government (you ain't seen me, right?),\n\t\t\tbut then comes the time to play Police Chief.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe set off at a fair old clip, guitars fizzing as MC Bot delivers our touching tribute to the boys who\n\t\t\tprotect and serve. As things warm up, the proud new father takes to the keys on his bullhorn and - behold!\n\t\t\t- the thing can make police car noises! Naturally enthused, Bot continues to nee-naw his way through the\n\t\t\tentirety of the tune. As we are happily shouting \"You've got it. We want it. What? Your currency\", a\n\t\t\tsmall crocodile of victorious and yet somehow strangely subdued officers make their way out of the room.\n\t\t\tOne of them, noting with his eagle-eyed detective skills that MC Bot might conceivably be taking something\n\t\t\tresembling the piss, mutters something along the lines of \"cults\" as he leaves. Mind how you go, now.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWilson rattle on through Buffalo Sniper and Dark Agenda. Just to make a point, like.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith those who are there at the death, it goes down great. Lusty cries of \"You whores!\" greet the intrepid\n\t\t\tWilson Four as they slink away from their amplifiers.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAndy Shaw, The Man from CAN, loved it, I'm told. He is a very nice man. He bought me a bottle of Pils\n\t\t\tand let me shout at the Police at some length and at considerable volume. He also gave us a lovely big\n\t\t\tbottle of Scotch with our wages. CAN is a charity dealing with drug and alcohol addiction issues.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYeah, I know.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThanks to Andy, though, and thanks to Jamie Jab for all his help, and thanks to those who came out to one\n\t\t\tof the weirdest gigs we've done in a while.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, chop-chop, ladies n gents - what's next?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAaaargh!

It's as if the audience have all just pulled up outside in some big old charabanc. It might be the lovely\n\t\t\tweather we've been having, I suppose. Maybe I'll get used to it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhatever, there were plenty of folks there to see me start up my set with a last-minute rendition of Out Of Touch,\n\t\t\tinspired partly by Mark Refoy's sending me a lovely photograph that he had taken recently of the Fishcotheque by night\n\t\t\t(yes, still going strong), and partly by Terry Walpole telling me how he had just picked up an American edition cassette\n\t\t\tof the Fishcotheque album for 79 pence in an Oxford charity shop. (He wuz robbed.) I do so enjoy shouting \"Welcome to folk\n\t\t\tclub\" over a fat Fun Lovin' Criminals sample. Then I felt it was time for a nice sea shanty, so we had My Desert,\n\t\t\trapturously greeted by a disbelieving Refoy. Onwards through the ill-advised Scandal In Bohemia stuff: a well-received\n\t\t\tSouthern Mark Smith and a fairly chaotic Real Men. Then a couple of covers and I'm done. Thanks everybody, you made it\n\t\t\tnice and easy for me. I enjoyed it a lot.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSyd Meats was feeling the love too: he tells me that the audience at Masters of Budvar is easily better than the one at\n\t\t\tLincoln Prison. (Better looking too, one kinda hopes.) Alone with his guitar, Syd launched bravely into his first number,\n\t\t\tcocked it up almost immediately and restarted before anybody had quite figured out what the hell was going on. As he\n\t\t\tpointed out, his songs are short, but that just means you get more of them! Syd sailed through a set of lovely originals,\n\t\t\tperhaps the finest of which is the gorgeous \"Walking Sideways\", and still found time to lay that special version of Common\n\t\t\tPeople on the crowd. You know, the one that goes \"You'll never be like Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBack to the digital stuff, then. The Echo Chamber were up next, stirring up hyperactive house beats with lush,\n\t\t\theavily-delayed electric guitar and sweet vocal melodies. They started with their \"theme tune\", In Love With The City,\n\t\t\tthen rushed through a thirty minute set that was crammed with wide-eyed psychedelic pop invention. Faced with demands for\n\t\t\tan encore, they pleaded that they didn't have any more material ready to play. No problem. We just made them play\n\t\t\tsomething a second time, and this time there was dancing.They brought copies of their very first single with them (it's a\n\t\t\tdouble a-side featuring 6am and Good Times, and it's available from the Wrong Crowd Recording Company, fact fans), which\n\t\t\tsold well after the show. And I'm chuffed to bits that the copy they slipped me turned out to be numbered 001. Cheers,\n\t\t\tgentlemen, nice touch. The Echo Chamber are on their way, and I only hope that we can still find a way to afford them in\n\t\t\tthe future.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo another cracking night at the Labour, and a nice garden party afterwards.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNext month we have some real, bona-fide pop stars coming to play, in the form of Gerard Langley and Rodney Allen of the\n\t\t\tBlue Aeroplanes.

A\n\t\t\tlarge silver station wagon packed to the gunnels with boxes of black and chrome slides stealthily along\n\t\t\ta quaint country lane. Two faintly desperate looking men in sunglasses are in the front, their windows\n\t\t\twound fully down, as though the day were much sunnier than it is. From those windows comes a cloud of\n\t\t\tacrid smoke and the unmistakeable roar of Killing Joke's mighty Asteroid. The first wave has almost\n\t\t\tmade it to Security Checkpoint One.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn the floor of the Nene Valley some twelve miles east of Northampton lie the Grendon Lakes. The place\n\t\t\tis a local beauty spot, popular with fishermen, families and - on occasion - with the more hardcore\n\t\t\telement of the Racehorse regulars. There is a nice little club house there with a bar, restaurant and\n\t\t\tall the facilities you could want. A pleasant little patio looks out over the water.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBecause of the eponymous lakes, somebody has had the bright idea of staging an extreme sports event\n\t\t\there: wakeboarding, skateboarding, BMX, all that sort of thing. Air 05 is to be a three day event with\n\t\t\tlive music, DJs, camping, all that good shit. Wilson have been invited to play the first evening, so\n\t\t\there we are, about half a mile off the main road, waiting in a short line of vehicles queuing to clear\n\t\t\tsecurity. Agent Wilson and I are impressed to see that the people checking the vehicles are in\n\t\t\tparamilitary garb, some with helmets and goggles. They do take their time, though. It must have\n\t\t\tsomething to do with the large and immobile Winnebago parked up about three ahead of us. Eventually we\n\t\t\tannounce ourselves as Wilson: The First Wave and are tooled up with the requisite paperwork to proceed\n\t\t\tto Security Checkpoint Two. We continue down the track towards the lakes, wondering how many people are\n\t\t\tgoing to be queuing up at that gate later in the weekend.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCheckpoint Two succumbs easily to the glamour of our new paperwork and in a minute or two we are\n\t\t\tpulling up outside the clubhouse. As we load in Rob from The Buzz is at the controls. playing groovy\n\t\t\tpunk, soul and dub sounds to perhaps two or three dozen people milling about on the patio or down by\n\t\t\tthe lake, where the wakeboarders are warming up. Russ tools me up with some fags and leaves me to set\n\t\t\tup as much kit as I can while he sets off back to NN1 to fetch the Second Wave. Rob Carter buys me a\n\t\t\tpint of Stella. It is 4:00pm.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt a picnic table high on a hill above the lake under a leaden sky they sit, crow-like. Wilson, minus\n\t\t\tMC Bot but plus Anita Allbright and her small Soviet flask of brandy, huddle together, safe in the\n\t\t\tknowledge that a soundcheck has finally been completed. A few last shafts of sunlight break through the\n\t\t\tlooming clouds. Red sky at night: shepherd's delight. Red sky in the morning: nuclear war.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe watch the wakeboarders still practising in the fading light. They are getting air all right. It is\n\t\t\tradical, possibly gnarly even. Stevie G decides that he wants to see some mishap action. Each time one\n\t\t\tof the talented aquatic daredevils comes speeding by, Steve cries with a passionate intensity: \"Foot off!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA tall, dark figure is coming up the hill towards the picnic table. It is unsteady on its feet and it\n\t\t\tis gesticulating wildly in a manner that we cannot fully understand. It is MC Bot and he feels like\n\t\t\tgetting naked. Somebody asks what time it is. It is eight o'clock. We are on at ten o'clock. A sort of\n\t\t\tdesperate hilarity breaks out.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI miss the first band on the bill. Rob Carter reckons that they did Stone Roses songs in a Norfolk\n\t\t\taccent: \"The Alan Partridge Project\". Mind you, Rob Carter is off his face. They seemed like perfectly\n\t\t\tdecent people to me. I wobble off and sit by the peaceful water's edge. Rob Carter plays Crazy Horses\n\t\t\tby the Osmonds. While I am still reeling from this, he wanders out of the clubhouse and finds me at the\n\t\t\twater's edge: \"Oi, Buckley - No!\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe second band are very competent and are going down very well with the ten or twelve people who have\n\t\t\tactually gone into the clubhouse. This is not entirely the band's fault. The room is small and the PA\n\t\t\tis very large indeed. Those who are in the room are literally pinned along the back wall. This does\n\t\t\tnot, however, sink in at the time. Somehow I reckon it will be different for us. Had you asked me where\n\t\t\tI thought all the people were coming from, I might have gone a bit quiet, though.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFrom the moment we take the stage it is chaos. We are really, really loud. MC Bot is really, really off\n\t\t\tit and really, really up for it at the same time. The stage doesn't even hold him until the first\n\t\t\tchorus. He's out there. Those who weren''t already pinned against the back wall by the volume are now\n\t\t\tcowering there in the hope that the crazy singer man's microphone lead won't reach that far. It does,\n\t\t\tthough. Nobody is safe. With Bot spending most of his time in front of the PA, the filthy racket that\n\t\t\twe are already generating becomes wholesomely larded with swathes of mid-range feedback. The band is\n\t\t\tplaying its teeth out. It's murder.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere is so little room on the stage that I stay pretty much immobile, head down, getting on with it as\n\t\t\tbest I can. I miss lots of what is going on. By the end I pretty much assume that we have cleared the\n\t\t\tplace. So as everyone leaves the stage I get down on the floor and make with a little bit of delay\n\t\t\tfeedback. As the other sounds die away I start to reduce the level, then slow it down to sound like a\n\t\t\trecord slowly running out of speed. It takes ages. I am certain that nobody is paying the slightest\n\t\t\tattention. As finally I fade the feedback out to silence, for a second you can hear a pin drop. Then\n\t\t\tabout three young girls burst into keen applause. Bless 'em, I think, they were waiting for the ending.\n\t\t\tA few people come up and say very polite things. Rob Carter reckons it was fantastic. Did I mention\n\t\t\tthat Rob Carter is off his face?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy midnight we are speeding back through the Northamptonshire country lanes, heading for Agent\n\t\t\tWilson's. Running the performance back in my head I simply cannot see how we are going to play the\n\t\t\tBalloon Festival tomorrow without getting fully and comprehensively arrested."},{"gigtext_id":524,"datetime":"2005-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"Natasha House - Northampton Chronicle & Echo","credit_url":"","credit_date":"2005-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Monday 1st August 2005\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tUpstairs at The Labour Club, Northampton NN1\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tdraft dodgers deluxe present\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBARRY \"THE FISH\" MELTON\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJOE WOOLLEY\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA genuine living legend of the San Francisco psychedelic underground is coming to play in Northampton Town.

He has played with everybody from Quicksilver's John Cipollina to the Grateful Dead.\n\t\t\tAnd now, by a quirk of fate which even we don't quite understand, he's coming to play - solo and acoustic - in the\n\t\t\ttop room of the Labour Club! Barry has promised two 45 minute sets, taking in everything from folk to blues to the\n\t\t\ttruly freaked-out. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the music lovers of Northampton to see The Real Deal\n\t\t\tup close and personal.

The very same Barry \"The Fish\" Melton graced\n\t\t\tNorthampton with this intimate gig, taking to the hot seat only after <a href=\"/gigs/search.html?f=act&q=Joe+Woolley\">Joe Woolley</a> set the scene with his always\n\t\t\tdelightfully affecting yet unaffected acoustic ditties.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhile the rickety old Labour Club holds no more history for some than a few Friday night drinking excursions, Barry Melton\n\t\t\tis enamoured with its links to a labour movement arguably long forgotten. When they weren't fighting for workers' rights\n\t\t\this parents introduced him to the wistful, witty and inspiring folk songs of the early 1930s American labour movement,\n\t\t\tmirrored in the union posters on the walls of Northampton's own Labour Club.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTurns out that like a fine wine you've never heard of but you know you're going to enjoy, Barry Melton is rich and\n\t\t\tsatisfying in the drinking. Far from stuck in a 1960s time warp, he recalls Woodstock psychedelia with the wry humour of a\n\t\t\tman who knows that getting wasted and writing songs about hamburgers falling in love with hotdogs is a novelty that just\n\t\t\twon't last.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tStill, he doesn't regret one moment of it, and neither do we as his awesome, and at times ridiculous, gravelly blues and\n\t\t\ttraditional union chants float into the night air, reminding Northampton that there's a vintage you can't buy on Camden\n\t\t\tHigh Street.

Happily\n\t\t\tJulie Reinger and the Weather Prophets have got it badly wrong. Deluge there is none. It's a beautiful\n\t\t\tday in the neighbourhood. The first thing we find as we enter the backstage compound is the Mystic\n\t\t\tCrew, which is a good way to start. Northampton's finest original reggae rockers have the slot before\n\t\t\tours this afternoon, but right now the Drake Music Project are onstage. They are an extraordinary band,\n\t\t\tmade up entirely of some pretty severely disabled people. With keyboards and percussion they are\n\t\t\tweaving a mad, precise and rather beautiful sort of mutated sixties soundtrack samba sound. It's like\n\t\t\tnothing you have ever heard. See them if you get the chance; you won't believe what's going on in front\n\t\t\tof you.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy the time the Second Wave has arrived, there is something even stranger up there on the stage. In my\n\t\t\tweakened condition I am astonished to see a seven foot high giant panda in a bright red satin Fun\n\t\t\tManchu gown cavorting with an equally massive dog, a bear in dungarees and a huge koala in a yellow\n\t\t\tt-shirt with a map of Australia on it. They go into a frenzied dance routine to a song about somebody\n\t\t\t(one them, I can only guess) having a birthday. This also is like nothing you have ever seen. It is\n\t\t\twrong, distressing and horribly seductive. Ah, the lure of plush - perhaps it is as well that Stevie G\n\t\t\tis not with us today. A nice holiday in the wholesome seaside air of beautiful Pembrokeshire will\n\t\t\tsurely be better for the poor man's head. Meanwhile, I am trying to figure how I can get my hands on\n\t\t\tthe panda outfit. Then I have to have some beer. Quickly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe relentless positivity and family-friendliness of the acts onstage has completely vaporized my head.\n\t\t\tWhat are we doing here with our songs about cancer, corruption and war? When a nice man comes out and\n\t\t\tannounces the Mystic Crew with a spiel that involves the words \"positive sunshine vibrations\" I teeter\n\t\t\ton the edge of panic.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHappily, the Crew are positive in all the right ways. Dennis on the bass sounds huge and he's playing a\n\t\t\tblinder. With both Robbie and Zebby onstage the Mystics are blessed with two really charismatic,\n\t\t\ttuneful front men, which really gets the crowd involved. Nothing too mental, mind, all solid, melodic\n\t\t\tstuff, beautifully delivered. Though I don't know if I'll ever get my head around the version of \"I\n\t\t\tStill Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" ...however much of an improvement it is on the original.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe really good news is that all this reggae music is sounding fantastic through the big old outdoor\n\t\t\tPA. Somebody out there is clearly well on top of their job. This we find reassuring. We head backstage\n\t\t\tto assemble our kit, just in time to find our old friend Ruby the red bus pulling in with Jonny Mattock\n\t\t\tat the wheel and a well-dressed but not entirely stable Joe Woolley on board. Out of the van he comes.\n\t\t\tOver he goes. Later tonight I will find him being carried, unconscious, down the stairs on the back of\n\t\t\tAgent Wilson. Griff from the BBC Weekender comes by and asks how it went at Air 05 last night. \"Chaos,\n\t\t\tmate. Like the Stooges' last ever gig,\" I tell him with a rueful smile. I can feel the bravery\n\t\t\tradiating off him. All his artist are belong out control.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMystic Crew finish their set to warm applause, then there are a fairly frantic fifteen minutes of\n\t\t\tmoving shit about, plugging shit in and generally sorting shit out. At 5:30 the DJ shuts down and\n\t\t\tthat's it: we're on. The first sound that can be heard is a police radio, dubbed up to the eyes,\n\t\t\tfloating out over bewildered balloon festival families. There are, to our delight, little knots of\n\t\t\tmates out there in the crowd. Also there is Holly. As the instruments kick in and we realise that, yes,\n\t\t\twe can more or less all hear each other on this whopping great stage, it's all set. If only the very\n\t\t\tfirst line of the song wasn't \"Grandpa pissed his pants again\"...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBot and I are on our best behaviour. This grandpa did him pants instead. Still, it doesn't change the\n\t\t\tfact that we are starting with a tune about incest, madness, sickness and death. I'm missing Steve, me.\n\t\t\tI feel like I'm too loud and exposed on my stupid ostrich guitar. I'm wondering if we might be needing\n\t\t\tto dig deep to find a little something extra this afternoon when something comes to pass.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs the first chorus hits I look to my right and there is Curtis, craning to shout harmoniously down my\n\t\t\tmicrophone. No milk crates being available, the stage crew sort him out with his own microphone and -\n\t\t\tbehold - we are six once again. The return of Mister E. Wilson! Curt stalks the stage, vibing things up\n\t\t\ta treat. There are enough Wilson heads in the audience to get something going and the whole set starts\n\t\t\tto roll rather nicely. Ash and Rhiannon from the Racehorse are down the front, arms in the air, rocking\n\t\t\tit properly. Holly wants to hear that song about bananas, but we play Police Chief instead. It's not\n\t\t\tthe vicious maelstrom of last night, which is probably all to the good. It's measured and right and\n\t\t\twhat we lose from Stevie G's wicked guitar we make up with the spectacle of a shouty bald man stamping\n\t\t\tabout shouting \"Kill 'im!\" That and the fact that Steve Bes is on fire. Literally. Smoke rising all\n\t\t\taround him in the most disconcerting fashion.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs we come off stage there is nobody waiting with plastic handcuffs. We count this as a victory. We\n\t\t\tclear the stage in preparation for Joe and Jonny. The DJ from Inspiration FM teases the audience,\n\t\t\ttelling them that they are about to see Jah Woolley.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPeople speak kindly to us and tell us that the sound was good. Having seen the Mystics I can get my\n\t\t\thead around this and I feel pleased. Then the Mystics tell us that we were good, and we tell them that\n\t\t\tthey were good, and respect is all over the place. I realise that we have indeed got away with it. Then\n\t\t\tI have to have another beer. Quickly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJoe and Jonny turn in a set that is completely mental. Jon's kick drum is massive, more than\n\t\t\tcompensating for the lack of any bass guitar. Joe is ranting and raving like a good 'un, shredding at\n\t\t\this acoustic guitar, but the entire crowd has its back to him, watching as about 50 balloons take off\n\t\t\tinto the lovely blue sky for their evening flight. This is something that I do not envy him. Unable to\n\t\t\tgaze any longer upon the bizarre spectacle, I join MC Bot backstage for debriefing.\n\t\t\t\"So, did you know that Curtis was coming?\" he asks.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"Well, he stopped by my yard about two hours ago in a big red Piper Heidsieck apron and I slipped him\n\t\t\tStevie G's backstage pass...but I didn't know he was going to do that.\"\n\t\t\t\"Aaaaaaah...\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe hang out behind the stage and listen to Joe and Jon ripping it up like they are The Who or\n\t\t\tsomething. They do a version of \"Who Do You Love?\" which goes mad at the end. Jon is doing ridiculous,\n\t\t\tover-the-top, out-of-time Keith Moon drum rolls. The guitar sounds very peculiar indeed. Then all we\n\t\t\tcan hear is Jon whacking the occasional cymbal, apparently at random. Then we see Jon and Joe come\n\t\t\treeling down the ramp from the stage, arm in arm, covered in sweat, gathering momentum and ready to go\n\t\t\tover in about...ooooh...two and three quarter seconds. Yup. There they go. Whump! Upright again, Jon\n\t\t\tdives into Ruby and emerges with a bottle of champagne. He and Joe make like racing drivers. At one\n\t\t\tpoint they have both got champagne coming out of their noses. By this time, of course, Wilson have hold\n\t\t\tof the bottle.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOf course, it turns out that we've missed it all. Kathie, who was out front, tells me all about it, how\n\t\t\tJoe smashed his guitar to matchwood in front of the whole crowd. Those weird single cymbal crashes?\n\t\t\tThat was Jon synchronising with the final, lethal blows. Kathie is concerned \"What's he going to do\n\t\t\tnow?\" she wants to know, not unreasonably. Turns out that Joe had bought a guitar especially for the\n\t\t\tpurpose. \"What did you pay for that then?\" I ask him. \"Ten quid\" he replies, the devious hound. Of\n\t\t\tcourse, round about now I have to have another beer. Quickly.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe stick around a while to enjoy Visionstate, who do good things with the old bass-drums-two guitar\n\t\t\tline-up. Sharp and a bit modal, reminiscent of very early Oasis, but in a good way. They could make a\n\t\t\tlot of young people very sweaty. I'd enjoyed their record on the Weekender show, and I wasn't\n\t\t\tdisappointed. Perhaps they'd like to play the Labour Club some time? But it's time to go now, for we\n\t\t\thave to eat and make our way down the hill to Mister Cotton's house for the mother of all parties.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJust to confirm: Nobody got arrested. Nobody got hurt. Nothing got broken. Except Joe's guitar. And he\n\t\t\tmeant to do that. Honest."},{"gigtext_id":527,"datetime":"2005-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The way that Joe Woolley sold this night to me was that there was nothing booked in at the Labour Club, so he\n\t\t\twas planning to take his estimable acoustic club downstairs into the main bar, a sort of \"Beat Saturday\" if\n\t\t\tyou will. You know the sort of thing - not a \"proper\" gig, just a few mates sat round playing tunes in the\n\t\t\tneighbourhood bar of a Saturday night. Old school. Easy. Local.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo would I care to put in half an hour as a solo acoustic pensioner? Sure, beats watching facile Saturday\n\t\t\tnight TV.\n\t\t\tI can tape Match of the Day. No problem.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen a few days before the gig, Joe comes to me and asks about my bass playing. After his recent excesses\n\t\t\twith Jon Mattock, Joe is after rocking himself up. We spend a boozy evening learning a Warren Zevon tune.\n\t\t\tTowards the end of the evening Joe tells me that he wants to play the Perfect Disaster's B-52! It crosses my\n\t\t\tmind that Jonny used to play B-52 with the Perfect Disaster. Bloody hell, you might say.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDisconcerted, enraged with a vital surge of pure rock fury, but without any time to go on a programming\n\t\t\tspree, I decide that my approach to my set should be of the old school. I style it \"sit down mental\". No amp,\n\t\t\tno fancy playing or singing, just heads-down, wig-out acoustic idiot music...and if anybody doesn't like it,\n\t\t\tthey can meet my piggie Sam. My only intention is to keep the guitar in tune. After that, it's all up for\n\t\t\tgrabs.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo this is what I play:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tQuality People - The Ugliest Song In The World - Big Jake (by Curtis) - Ghosts - Hysteria - Sister Death.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFor the last song I am joined by Joe, who burns vital gases out of the atmosphere with his electric guitar.\n\t\t\tIt's about 9:45 and the Labour Club is wringing with hideous scrabbling guitar noise. Yes. Welcome to\n\t\t\tacoustic night.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJoe takes the stage and plays a few numbers on his own. Then Jon Mattock joins him for a few tunes. The small\n\t\t\tcrowd is growing larger and rowdier. Joe is giving his all. Jonny is watching him like a hawk and drumming\n\t\t\tlike a medium. Then they call me back up and I have to strap on the big bass. We play:\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCarmelita (by Warren Zevon) - B52 (by the Perfect Disaster) - Magic Bus (by The Who)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDuring B52 I look up and see Kevin Haskins walking into the Labour Club. He's over in town for the weekend\n\t\t\tand apparently someone has told him that I was playing an acoustic set. Well, them's the breaks. Acoustic\n\t\t\tnight just turned into mental, churning acid rock frenzy night.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAn encore was attempted but Joe had seized the bass and I couldn't get any noise out of the guitar (I expect\n\t\t\the broke it), so I fled the stage, leaving Joe and Jon to pass a contented ten minutes or so re-inventing\n\t\t\tprogressive rock somewhere along the Can/Pink Floyd axis of evil.

An uneventful journey takes us to a small, orange basement beneath the very\n\t\t\theart of Oxford. The Cellar used to be part of the wine cellars pof the Oxford Union\n\t\t\tSociety (ooh), on whose lawns Russ, Anita and I later smoke a sneaky spliff. Now it\n\t\t\tis a groovy wee catacomb with a helpful soundman called Robin. We set up and\n\t\t\tsoundcheck with ruthless efficiency then head off to the house of Matt Sewell,\n\t\t\tsinger of The New Moon, where we are to be fed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter an interesting van/underground-parking-lot interface we relax in style as Matt\n\t\t\tand Chrissie regale us with phenomenal quantities of delicious chilli and beer in\n\t\t\ttheir calm and lovely flat. Well, as calm as anything with Terry Walpole in it can\n\t\t\tbe...\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tOn the way back to the venue I try to send the entire band the wrong way up St.\n\t\t\tGiles Street. \"It's probably changed a bit since you were here,\" says Pete.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe New Moon open the show at the faintly ridiculous hour of 8:30. There is already\n\t\t\ta small crowd, though, which swells throughout their set. Shades of Robin Hitchcock\n\t\t\tand Jeff Buckley hover around the surprisingly tough sounds that Matt and bassist\n\t\t\tIan conjur. The double bass really does give the songs body and drive and Matt is in\n\t\t\tfine voice. Later they are joined by a man playing a flute. He's very good, but I\n\t\t\twouldn't have said they really needed him.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA good crowd has gathered by the time that The Race begin their set. We don't know\n\t\t\tmuch about them beyond the fact that they come from Reading, but we do know that\n\t\t\tthey are on a bit of a tour, and we rather suspect that perhaps most of the punters\n\t\t\ttonight will really be here to see them, not us. (This actually turns out not to be\n\t\t\ttrue - I should point out that a lot of them are probably there more for the\n\t\t\tpound-a-pint deal than for any particular one of the groups.)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Race start strongly; in tune, powerful, passionate. It's The Big Music. During\n\t\t\ttheir first number, which starts off epic and then, rather bravely, just gets bigger\n\t\t\tand bigger, Russ and I both suddenly realise that they remind us of U2. It's a kind\n\t\t\tof music that I don't usually like, but they do it with charm and verve, and in a\n\t\t\tsmall cellar on a cold night it is very agreeable.The diminiutive frontman, who has\n\t\t\ta lovely voice, is whacking the shit out himself with his tambourine. I would be\n\t\t\tsurprised if he sits down for a week. Two or three more epics into their set and\n\t\t\tTerry Walpole is on the dance floor, whirling like a dervish and frightening the\n\t\t\tnatives. Meanwhile MC Bot is in something called The Goat With Three Heads. Russ and\n\t\t\tAnita and I attempt to go and find this goat, but get no further than the\n\t\t\taforementioned lawns of academe.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSoon enough we are on the little stage: the sound is crisp, the house full, the\n\t\t\theadcase down the front. We play the same set we have played since Steve Bez joined\n\t\t\tus, and once again it is improved. It really feels good, with Steve Bez and Russ\n\t\t\tlocked into a groove and Kathy good and loud, courtesy of The Race's marvellous bass\n\t\t\ttractor. Good response from the audience too. They didn't lose interest after The\n\t\t\tRace after all. Native observers later tell us that for Oxford they were positively\n\t\t\tanimated.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA drink or two and a brief chat with Richard from Gappy Tooth Promotions (he sounded\n\t\t\tlike my kind of guy) and we're stuffing ourselves back into the van, all paid up and\n\t\t\tpacked away. On the trip home we hear somebody on national BBC Radio use the phrase\n\t\t\t\"celebrating Auschwitz\". Well done, everybody out there in Hollyoaks World. I was\n\t\t\twondering how long it would take.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSincere thanks, though, are due to Matt and Chrissie for their extreme hospitality;\n\t\t\tto Jimmy Evil for booking us; to The Race for being so easy to work with and for\n\t\t\tthat lovely bass thing; and to Terry Walpole, for it is true that without him the\n\t\t\tevening would never actually have happened.\n\t\t\t<p>"},{"gigtext_id":544,"datetime":"2005-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"People of Earth-\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe first Masters of Budvar night of the new year falls this Friday 7th January 2005 at our regular\n\t\t\tvenue, the Labour Club, Charles Street, Northampton NN1.

I had anticipated something of a\n\t\t\tpost-festive slowdown, but instead the place was absolutely packed.Perhaps they had all heard Big\n\t\t\tTim's new recording on the BBC Weekender. We listened to it huddled together in Big Tim's car\n\t\t\toutside the club, and it came across truly magnificent. Mark Refoy's production magic clearly in\n\t\t\tevidence on the brilliant new waxing \"A Prayer For Thee\" - God, it sounds like Roy Orbison!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs usual, Big Tim had to be restrained with steel hawsers before taking the stage before everyone\n\t\t\twas in the house. Eventually we let him go up there. As the dulcet tones of \"I'm Batman\" by The\n\t\t\tMarble Tea gently faded out, Big Tim picked up the chords, strummed along and piled straight into\n\t\t\tthe intro to one of his own tunes, an inspired beginning. Standing four-square in front of the\n\t\t\tswelling crowd, Tim was on fire, barely stopping for breath between one hit and another. A great\n\t\t\tset.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMinimal fuss as Mrs. Pilgrimm installed herself onstage and tore off into her set. Once again,\n\t\t\tabsolutely inspired. It's not easy to write about Mrs. P's music, because it is so unique.

Wa-hey!"},{"gigtext_id":547,"datetime":"2005-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Some far-out and provocative shit on offer at Friday's latest in the Masters of Budvar What's On Next Challenge\n\t\t\tSeries.\n\t\t\tOn the stereo we played New Order, Can, Anthony and the Johnsons, Rolo McGinty's Bad Apples CD and more besides, but\n\t\t\tthat's not really what I meant. After a month or two away, the funny coloured lights made a welcome return to action,\n\t\t\tand we had that black stuff hanging up all over the walls and the windows, with big old electric fans blowing every\n\t\t\twhichway. That's not it either, though.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt about 9:15 three young men take to the corner of the room which, with an arch and knowing wink, we call \"the\n\t\t\tstage\". These men, for a whom a small and painfully hip crowd has gathered, are none other than Elk Force. Now, I\n\t\t\tbelieve that in my advertising spiel I might possibly have caused some inadvertent distress to Elk Force's hip-hop\n\t\t\tkingpin Scott by implying that The Force might in some way prove difficult or...I think the word was \"harrowing\". As\n\t\t\the himself put it:\n\t\t\t<p class=\"annotation\">\n\t\t\t\" We honestly didn't know we were traumatic, terrifying and troublesome. We always thought we were more of a mildly\n\t\t\tleft wing pop outfit for the mtv generation. (that was the idea anyway). Just for the record, we in no way support\n\t\t\tchairman mao - He was a very bad man whose presence still seems to loom large and overshadow China - It's time China\n\t\t\tfaced up to this and moved on.\"\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\tBut of course.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTo be fair, the Hinterhoff label's latest hopefuls had, since recording their inital manifesto, focussed their -\n\t\t\tshall we say? - sonic maelstrom with the clever addition of drummer Ben Jackson, last seen round these parts with\n\t\t\tSaab 77. With Ben driving things along with force and precision, it was easier to follow the intricate and\n\t\t\tever-so-slightly mental patterns that Scott and Richard weave with their guitars. Great lyrics well delivered. It's a\n\t\t\tshame that tune about the Jesus Centre doesn't go on a bit longer. Remix, anybody?\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis was the first appearance of Elk Force and they played really well. By the end of the night it was hard to find a\n\t\t\tpunter not proudly sporting their Elk Force button badge. I have no idea as to whether these people are going to do\n\t\t\tmore of this, and I've no idea how to describe what they do. I still think they're mental, but I can see how they\n\t\t\tmight not appear that way to people who listen to modern post-rock type stuff. Somewhere to the left of Pavement,\n\t\t\tperhaps. (I know nothing about that kind of music. Shows, doesn't it?)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSwiftly following The Force came Rosie Wilby accompanied by Kontra Band's Al Tate on bass and Paul de Gallier on\n\t\t\tpercussion. A much more melodic proposition, the trio made the most of the club sound system with a warm, deep sound\n\t\t\tthat made a perfect setting for Rosie's singing. Still reeling from Glastonbury, Rosie even took on the swelling\n\t\t\tcrowd of hepsters on her own, singing the most delicate ballad imaginable. There is an awful lot of songwriting savvy\n\t\t\tat work here, choruses that just fall right out at you, like that one on You Amaze Me, which gets stuck in my damn\n\t\t\thead all the time. And check out Guitar Rosie - she knows all the chords. A warm, assured showing; just the thing for\n\t\t\tjust that moment, really.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhen the Telescopes arrived for a soundcheck I was surprised to see that they showed no interest in any of the\n\t\t\tmicrophones set up around the stage and that they didn't really seem to have anything that they wanted to plug into\n\t\t\tthe PA. All these charming types from Burton On Trent really seemed to want was tables. As many tables as you've got,\n\t\t\treally, thanks. Brilliant. On these tables Steven and Lorin set up guitars and various devices which they employ to\n\t\t\tcoax sounds from these guitars. They effectively operate on the instruments, like surgeons. Instead of scalpels they\n\t\t\temploy ball-bearings, violin bows, portable electric fans, crocodile clips and a seven inch tall metal robot. All of\n\t\t\twhich goes off into a bewildering array of outboard hardware for treatment before barreling on out the amplifiers at\n\t\t\tyou, the punter. Jo, meanwhile, sits on her amp, big old 335 in her lap, rapt in concentration.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy the time the Telescopes were taking to the stage it had crossed my mid that I might as well try to use the three\n\t\t\tmicrophones to some effect, so in a homage to the Telescopes' erstwhile producer Rich Formby, I pottered around \"sort\n\t\t\tof\" setting up the mics to pick up amps and ambience and broadcast same through the PA. To be honest, I wish I'd done\n\t\t\tit all a bit louder.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Telescopes start their set with a lush drone, centred around the soporific beat of a needle spinning on an empty\n\t\t\trecord deck. The drone builds, changes texture, swells, recedes. The surgeons are hard at work on their instruments,\n\t\t\theads down. Jo's head is down too. When once she glances up into the crowd it is with a look of icy determination\n\t\t\tthat could stop a speeding truck. People are staring open-mouthed. No beat comes crashing in, no vocal emerges; only\n\t\t\tthe most abstract wisps of melody, conjured from the very effect of the different constituent elements of the drone\n\t\t\tmoving cyclically/seismically together and apart. Some people, it has to be said, are becoming impatient. Most are\n\t\t\tvery quiet. I'm bloody riveted, me.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAfter who-knows-how-long the initial drone starts to fade and an electronic ghost of a beat begins to pulse beneath\n\t\t\tthe soundscapes. They're into Phase Two of their set and things are getting a touch polarised. There are people\n\t\t\tactually leaving. Well, it's Friday night and maybe this isn't what they'd bargained for and that's fair enough.\n\t\t\tMeanwhile back on Planet X, the Telescopes continue to sculpt and shape their noise to great effect. When finally,\n\t\t\tafter about 45 minutes of utterly beautiful music, they achieve a graceful landing, those who have taken the ride\n\t\t\talong with them give genuinely warm and appreciative applause. With good reason. This is not the sort of thing that\n\t\t\tyou see every day. In fact, the last time I can recall being at a gig like this was the Spacemen's evening of\n\t\t\tcontemporary sitar music at the Watermans Art Centre in Brentford. Frankly and fortunately, the atmosphere tonight\n\t\t\tdoesn't come close to the chilly miasma of misunderstanding, suspicion and thinly-veiled hostility that characterised\n\t\t\tthe event that launched the Dreamweapon. No, China has moved on, so instead it's trebles all round and back to\n\t\t\tMasters of Budvar Secret Headquarters for afters. Thanks to the Labour Club, Andy, all the musicians and everybody\n\t\t\twho came out."},{"gigtext_id":548,"datetime":"2005-06-26T22:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Free admission.

Fishy blames Big Tim Sansom (a spurious excuse, if ever there were one) and careers off into a karaoke\n\t\t\tset, crashing into the wall about twenty minutes later with a rendition of De La Soul's \"Tread Water\".\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis is Peter Crouch's first ever solo show, so he has sent for moral support and recruited the aforementioned Eider\n\t\t\tto play his lovely old Gretsch while a seated Crouchy sings and plays acoustic rhythm. Max starts a little quiet,\n\t\t\tbut, once he hits the right level, he provides a beautiful lush accompaniment to Crouchy's acid-tongued chronicles of\n\t\t\tintercontinental anguish and despair. It's fun to hear him playing Crouchy's own lead lines from the recordings too.\n\t\t\tAltogether it's an inspired pairing: elegant,\n\t\t\tworld-weary, darkly tuneful and quite mesmerising. We want this back again.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWearing a baseball cap and a fat old semi-acoustic that could almost give Max's Gretsch a run for its money,\n\t\t\taccompanied by assorted odd little bits of machinery and the dapper German jazz bassist Rainer, Wolfgang Tschegg\n\t\t\treturns to Northampton Town. He opens up with one of my favourite tunes, \"Helicopter\", then makes brief introductions\n\t\t\tbefore setting up the mutated bossanova beat for \"Mann aus den Bergen\", one of the loveliest tunes on his new album.\n\t\t\tNext comes a choppy little number called Mustang: \"And if you ask yourself do I mean the car or the horse...it\n\t\t\tdoesn't matter. Both are cool.\" By this stage of the game Wolfgang and Rainer are really grooving, and although their\n\t\t\tsinging in German makes them a touch impenetrable, the audience are starting to get it too. Me, I'm sitting right in\n\t\t\tfront of the stage, so happy I could...well, never mind what I could do. Wolfgang is giving that guitar a good going\n\t\t\tover. \"Yeah, yeah - all right!\" Then into the cool ballad \"Das Haus\" and \"Dunkel\" (\"It's a little bit dark, but not\n\t\t\tvery dark\") complete with harmonica solo before the recorder apocalypse that heralds the new single \"Tarzan Sagt\"\n\t\t\t(Yes, \"Tarzan Says\", that's right...) There is a touching version of \"Winter Kompakt\" before Rainer takes gamely to\n\t\t\tthe electric piano for \"Superhimmel\". There is a supremely far-out droney thing called \"Das Schiff\" (\"It's a space\n\t\t\tship\") with some outrageous bendy bass playing, all of which has people cheering like fools and baying for more, so\n\t\t\twe are graced with a kicking, souped-up \"Sonnenmaedchen\" to conclude.

It's so much more than just mood music. Soft and emotionally fragile might not be your\n\t\t\tthing. But you have to stand back and admit the guy can write and perform a song that tells a delicate story. You'd burst\n\t\t\tyourself with joy if you could sing such a song to your loved one. There are some distant FX guitar touches and the\n\t\t\tlightest of electronic suggestions. It fades deliciously away, leaving a nostalgic and lonesome feeling as piano notes\n\t\t\tfall like gentle touches of silk. It is beautiful.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt isn't rock and roll, but it could save your love life.\n\t\t\tFour and a half stars\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\tPraise for Ramon's new album, Foot of Film:\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tFoot of Film does not clamour for attention; instead, it draws you in almost imperceptibly with its diet of delicate\n\t\t\tstrummery, patches of melancholy and whimsy and De Juan's pure, beseeching tones.\n\t\t\tFiona Shepherd - The Scotsman'\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.ramondejuan.com\" target=\"new\">www.ramondejuan.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t</blockquote>"},{"gigtext_id":557,"datetime":"2005-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Ramon de Juan made a triumphant return to Masters of Budvar last Friday, silencing the rather garrulous\n\t\t\tcrowd with the simple power of a good tune properly sung.

He is also the kind of songwriter who can play his songs all on his own with just an acoustic guitar and\n\t\t\this unearthly voice and hold you spellbound, no less rock and roll than if he were fronting a full-on electric band with a ten-piece horn section. The boy just\n\t\t\tcan't help it.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDave Kusworth has been playing professionally since 1977, and at the turn of the eighties he founded The Hawks with the great Micky Greaney and a teenaged Steven\n\t\t\tDuffy (last sighted writing the songs on Robbie Williams' new album, for goodness' sake!) He toured and recorded with UK rock legends the Dogs D'Amour before\n\t\t\thooking up with the Swell Maps' Nikki Sudden to record several albums for Glass Records, Creation Records and Glitterhouse Records under the name of The\n\t\t\tJacobites. He has toured all over the world and his wild, cracked, heartbreaking songs have been covered by The Lemonheads and Mercury Rev.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs I write this, Dave has just returned from touring Germany with his band (where he was joined onstage in Berlin by Sudden) and he has just completed his\n\t\t\tumpteenth album, the particularly magnificent \"Silver Blades\". He will be appearing solo and acoustic at Masters of Budvar, offering a rare and unmissable insight\n\t\t\tinto his astonishing knack for writing simple but devastatingly effective rock and roll songs. As a writer and as a frontline rock and roll road warrior, Dave\n\t\t\treally is in the same league as Peter Perrett or Keith Richards. We are honoured to host him and we hope that, come closing time, you will love him, yea, even as\n\t\t\twe love him.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.davekusworth.com\" target=\"new\">www.davekusworth.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPAUL COX & JOE WOOLLEY\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMasters of Budvar regulars will be familiar with the elegant balladeering style of Northampton artist Paul Cox.

After releasing a couple of albums on their own independent Oporto Records in 2002/3, they were snapped up by tuition (home of Go-Betweens and Kevin Ayers) in 2005.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's impossible to draw comparisons, so no one does!\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHowever, their influences range from the melodic pop of The Go Betweens, through to Nick Drake, Love, Fairport Convention, The Velvet Underground right through to Erik Satie and Laurie Anderson, but this provides but a fraction of a guide to their unique musical appeal.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSpencer's unique musical talent creates sounds and landscapes which act as a cinematic canvas to singer-songwriter and former Blue Aeroplanes guitarist Caroline Trettine. Caroline, a former protegee of Billy Bragg, adds an extra dimension to The Winnebago Orchestra with her sensual and folk orientated vocal style.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe new Winnebago Orchestra album 'Born in the Sun' will be released in the UK, November 2007; Germany 25th January 2008; the USA and the rest of Europe January 2008 too.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thewinnebagoorchestra\" target=\"new\">www.myspace.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTHE HAVENOTS\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWell-loved local artist Liam Dullaghan and Sophia Marshall made two very well received albums as The Havenots.

NEVER SAY GOODNIGHT is the splendid second after 2003's BAD PENNIES, and the two song-writing youngsters (Liam Dullaghan and Sophia Marshall) already sound like old pros. Here they have an album solid with good songs, blends of gorgeous pop and unbridled folk-tinged melancholy.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t>From the rocky, Garbage-lite Sweetest Feeling to the fragile Ryan Adamsy Ghost to the ethereal Byrds influenced Lets Just Start Again, this bundle of tracks will no doubt to be a hit with both the alternative country in-crowd and Radio 2's more mainstream listeners. Sophia sings like a fallen angel while Liam tempers his smoky tones into a calm summer breeze. And Chicago songwriter Chris Mills guests on mandolin and synths as well as helping out with production.

A year ago Ray gave one of the most memorable shows that Masters of Budvar have hosted in four years. With a new album ready for release, they are unmissable.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tNew RAY single Great Strange Dream out now. This new single follows the release of their last two albums - Daylight in the Darkroom (Aug 2006) and Deep Blue Happy (Nov 2005). It was produced by regular band cohort John Rivers, - whose credits include The Specials (Ghost Town), Felt & Ocean Colour Scene. John was also at the production helm for their previous LPs.\n\t\t\tThese LPs (along with their 2001 Rough Trade debut First Light) have seen the London-based band reinforce their reputation for epic, emotive British guitar pop - having been hailed in some quarters as the missing link between House of Love, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Chameleons and Tindersticks\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe line up of songwriting brothers Nev and Mark Bradford (vocals and guitar respectively) and drummer Chris Lowe, have now been joined by Martin Tisdall on bass after the departure of Jenni Tarma to LA\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYoung Masters\n\t\t\tMojo\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAlmost flawless - Ray's touch is breathtaking\n\t\t\tQ\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGuitar notes hang in the air.

This time around, I brought a decent camera, my Canon G9, and was able to capture some photos and video, now on YouTube. It was an all-acoustic gig --just Pat, his guitar and a couple of effects pedals. Still, you got to see a glimpse of the man's range as a musician and songwriter, moving gracefully from humor to heartbreak and back again. As good as this gig was, it left me wanting for more. But for now, I'll just have to make due with some of the Jazz Butcher CD's from Amazon.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tOne nice change since the last gig in April is that London's bars and restaurants now have a smoking ban in effect.

By April Peter, with his teenage brother Jamie on Guitar (both sons of the ex Only Ones singer Peter Perrett) were invited to a recording session in Bethnal Green where they began work on the original recording of the Killamangiro single, which also included Seb Roachford (Acoustic Ladyland, Polar Bear) on drums. <br>\n\t\t\tWithin a week Doherty had moved into the Perrett household and they started touring around the country as Babyshambles. By June, Doherty had ended up in Thailand via The Priory and they saw less of him in person and more of him in headlines. For their 1st experience as professional musicians they were left some what disillusioned. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tAt the beginning of 2005 with a renewed thirst for playing music again, Peter and Jamie began looking for musicians to form a band. Recruiting their friend Eliot Vernon whom they met the previous year on a sound engineering D.S.S course, they played gigs like the Barfly, ULU, Rhythm Factory & Nambucca, ranging from a 4-6 piece under the working name The Cuts. Their then drummer James Kirkbright eventually had to leave due to medical reasons and the strains of commuting between Leeds and London. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tWhilst discussing the need for a replacement in their local hostelry in Kensington they were overheard by an eccentric Polish drummer, who introduced himself as their future! After an impromptu audition of table tapping and beer bottle bashing they were left convinced that the line-up was complete as the eventual 4 piece. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tWith Oskar Starski now in place and only in the band for a week, they were asked to appear at the Glastonbury Festival 2005 (in the medical tent!) where they were rewarded with free passes for the festival. At this time they did their 1st home recordings which included Psychobaby, Watery Eyes and Ten Watt Town. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tThey continued playing gigs along the way supporting Babyshambles, The Paddingtons, Cazals, The Maccabees, Selfish Cunt ... <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tNever satisfied with their band name, in January 2006 Jamie was inspired to come up with the name Love Minus Zero, not as a homage to Bob Dylan but more of a statement of intent. They set up a Myspace site and continued to gig under the new nom de guerre. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tSpring saw a flurry of gigs and a growing fan base, with a gig in Glastonbury in May being described by Jamie as \"The best reaction I've ever witnessed at a gig, even when I was in Babyshambles. An amazing show!\" <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tTheir 1st home recorded single \"Psychobaby\" was released last September on their own label and distributed through Cadiz/Pinnacle. <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\tReviews of Love Minus Zero:<br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\"A caustic riff-laden psychedelic maelstrom, the three track 'Psychobaby' single is the calling card of intent of Love Minus Zero. Immediate yet timeless, Love Minus Zero overthrow outmoded rock cliches with a gratifying urgency, splicing punk malice, psychedelic ska and searing guitars, as the 'Psychobaby' single attests.\" - Nina Antonia (Author and Music Journalist for Uncut and Mojo) <br>\n\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\"I was seriously impressed by this group, so much so that I went to see them again the following night when they played my local!

Decades later, after several chance meetings in the UK,\n\t\t\tBarbeau approached each of them separately. \"The idea of the band really\n\t\t\ttook shape in Berlin in May 2010 when Morris and I met to record, \" says\n\t\t\tBarbeau, \"but I'd asked them each at different times, and both seemed\n\t\t\tkeen.\"\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBarbeau began writing songs specifically for TMT in June 2010, soon after\n\t\t\tthe group's debut gig at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford. The final product, \n\t\t\tmuch of it recorded at Kimberley Rew's Remote Farm studio in\n\t\t\tCambridgeshire, sounds slightly more pared down compared to Barbeau's\n\t\t\trecent work, partly due to Metcalfe's influence as co-producer.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\"I've had many bands, but this the most a part of something I've ever\n\t\t\tfelt,\" says Barbeau. \"The fact that it's with Andy and Morris is amazing\n\t\t\tfor me. I'm proud of how the album reflects the intense effort and\n\t\t\tenthusiasm we all shared from the start, shaping the unique sound you hear\n\t\t\tnow.\" \n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.threeminutetease.com\" target=\"new\">www.threeminutetease.com</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPS - Keep an eye on the Youtube channel.

The road that started at the Black Lion on St Giles Street, NN1 some thirty-odd years ago, the road that led some dozen times around the globe, ends here; perhaps only forty miles from where it began. I stand on the corner of a little dogleg street just off Leicester’s Humberstone Road, smoking my hashish in the fog and the drizzle as the law demands. A solitary car comes sailing through the mist. Perhaps it is headed for the club where I’m playing? There is, after all, nothing else down here except for an empty municipal car park and me. As it reaches the corner, the car slows. I wonder if perhaps it is the chap who e-mailed me to say that he hoped to sneak out of his works knees-up in time to catch my set. It is not. The car is full of young Asian lads. They are laughing as they take the corner and speed away into the dirty night.\n\t<p>\n\tIt’s almost Christmas. In function rooms across the nation bosses are leering at their employees’ wives. Identikit shopping centres across the land are open late to squeeze the last few drops of disposable from the desperate. This Christmas it’s gonna be different. This Christmas it’s gonna be OK. Oh, Frankie, Frankie.\n\t<p>\n\tI have flu; proper chest-full-of- immovable-green-filth flu. I have had flu for the past three gigs and I have it now. For my dinner tonight I have enjoyed a bag of Mini-Cheddars and some Guinness flavoured potato crisps. I have a pint of Amstel, the remains of my spliff, three cigarettes and one pound seventy pence in change. Inside the club Kevin Hewick, barefoot and resplendent in his immaculate Nehru suit, is delivering a series of songs of astonishing intensity to an audience of about ten people.\n\t<i>\n\t<p>\n\tTime’s running out. The money’s running out.\n\t<br/>\n\tYou had a good time, now the money’s running out.\n\t</i>\n\t<p>\n\tThis is where it has all been leading. Let’s hit it.\n\t</i>\n\t<p>\n\tThe Musician in Leicester is a lovely venue. A proper, open-every-night live music venue that hosts acts from the West Coast of America as easily as it hosts local talent. Managed by the charming Chris with the indomitable Malcolm at the controls, it is clean, professional and altogether lovely. Chairs and tables, complete with candles. Excellent, professional PA system. Nice dressing room. Soap in the bathrooms. It’s a class joint. \n\t<p>\n\tTo be honest, the only reason they are entertaining me and my pals the Venus Fly Trap is because Leicester legend Kevin Hewick has asked them to, but such is the pleasant vibe about the place that this is clearly good enough for Malcolm and everybody else and they treat us very kindly indeed. Malcolm later tells me that, back in his Leicester days, Liam Dullaghan of “New Barcelona” fame was a regular, yea even unto the point of spending the occasional night sleeping on the stage.\n\t<p>\n\tBeautiful, purpose-built music club though it be, nobody could mistake the Musician for a place that benefits from a bustling central location. As Alex from the Fly Trap put it, it’s a “destination venue”. You’re not getting any casual walk-up here. This particular Thursday, two grim weeks before Christmas, people have not chosen to make the Musician their destination.\n\t<p>\n\tNone of this bothers Kevin. Airily pointing out to the few brave listeners that “I haven’t been here for...oooooh...two or three days”, he sets off into an astonishing set of tunes. At one point, as this huge, imposing presence intones a dark and rumbling “Yeeeeeeeeah!” a phrase forms spontaneous and uninvited in my mind: “Folk Clubs of the Cretaceous.” It does not feel like taking the piss. In fact, it feels entirely correct and slightly awesome.\n\t<p>\n\tHe might be on home turf. He might be going on first on a slow Thursday night in his local hang-out. It doesn’t matter. Kevin gives it everything, burns like Alan Vega and ends up, a fifty-something man with an acoustic guitar, sounding a lot like Nirvana at the top of their game. Follow that!\n\t<p>\n\tTonight I have come with my electric Gretsch and my home-cooked beats. After witnessing Micky Greaney’s astonishing solo acoustic performance on Friday night in Birmingham, I cannot bring myself even to attempt anything in the singer-songwriter line tonight. It’s all been done, better than I could have ever imagined. You should try to hear Micky’s new song “Playlist”, you really should. \n\t<p>\n\tThere was a moment back at the Oxford gig where, at the bilious conclusion of “Shirley Maclaine”, the poor, overloaded speakers started to vibrate in a rhythm quite different to that which I was generating with my right hand. It sounded like some absurd “acoustic” version of Suicide. Tonight I have a version of their song “Che” on my set list. I have the use of Andy Denton’s Marshall combo and (thanks to the generosity of Tim Harries) a bunch of analogue pedals that go one, two, three louder. Tonight I want to give it some; go down in flames and shit. Yeah.\n\t<p>\n\tIt doesn’t really happen that way. With some mumbled remarks about the Heat Death of the Universe, I set the little MP3 player off and we’re into a fairly competent but hardly inspiring “Shame About You”.  The perverse disco beat of “Che” starts up and I get to mess with the Bigsby a little bit but, with the best will in the world, it all comes out a bit Dave Gilmour down the pub of a Sunday lunchtime. \n\t<p>\n\tIt’s dark up here. I can’t see the audience. For reasons which seem opaque even at only a few days’ distance I choose to continue with “Wildlife”, a six minute, three chord dirge about dead people. Conceived in the aftermath of seeing John Cale perform “Paris 1919” with an orchestra, it aspires to a certain detatched stateliness; though, to be fair, it would also be possible to see it as a giant waste of everybody’s time. It goes all right, though and now I’m firing up for the Turkish remix of Buffalo Sniper. This gives me the opportunity to explore how Andy’s Marshall  responds to demands for feedback and I am delighted to discover that it responds very nicely indeed. Well, I say “nicely”...\n\t<p>\n\tAs the feedback dies away, the familiar, shuffling beat of “Shakey” starts to run and I manage a half-decent version of that particular six minute, three chord dirge as well. Next, I’m expecting the intro to Southern Mark Smith (complete with sampled Max Eider). Instead I listen, appalled, as the sound of a wheezing Casio issues from the PA. It is the sound of Mister Blagdon!\n\t<p>\n\tMister Blagdon, so local legend has it, was murdered and “walled-up” about a hundred and fifty years ago in the house where I used to live. One day in the nineteen-nineties he manifested via the medium of the Casio keyboard in my living room and committed to tape four small and diseased musical offerings, one of which, his...uh...<i>personal take on</i> Beethoven’s “death march” , is currently dripping like sonic mucus from the PA system. I turn to the MP3 player to discover that I have somehow programmed this into my set list. I have, in fact, somehow confused it with a ten second silence.\n\t<p>\n\tMister Blagdon duly evicted, I perform a fairly undistinguished version of “Southern Mark Smith”. And there it is. We are on the very precipice: just one more song to go. It is, as The King liked to say, now or never. The voice of William Burroughs croaks ominously over a fat, syrupy synthesiser pad, the Indian wedding tabla loops fall into place and here we go into “Solar Core”. If I have anything left to offer, here comes my last chance. It goes all right, as it happens, sparky and vicious, with plenty of that there feedback. For the first time I actually start to make the kind of noise I had been wanting to make all night. Let’s face it, I should really have started here. \n\t<p>\n\tI’ve not gone down in flames but I’ve not disgraced myself either. As I’m packing away my kit, Malcolm the sound man tells me that I have “some good material”.\n\t<p>\n\tIn due course the Fly Trap take to the stage. I don’t think I’ve ever seen them quite this good before. Very tough, very crunchy; and I can’t help but notice that Andy has eagerly taken up the Feedback Challenge. \n\t<p>\n\tThe evening winds down very pleasantly. A kind man buys me a pint. We make an uneventful journey back to NN1, where I am deposited upon my doorstep.\n\t<p>\n\tMy engagement book is completely empty. So is my bank account. I’m 55 years old and I have no more idea of what my immediate future might hold than a teenager who’s just walked out of school for the last time. Where, oh where, do we go from here?"},{"gigtext_id":721,"datetime":"2013-02-14T20:30:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"I will be one of four artists collaborating on an evening called \"Small Beast\".

Dazed from the explosion, his eyes smarting in the early dawn light he stumbled into a narrow sidestreet.\n\t\t\tPausing\n\t\t\tfor a moment, back up against a wall, ever conscious of being recognised he put on his dark glasses and fumbled for a cigarette. Lighting it, he gazed up for a\n\t\t\tmoment at the stars dimly gleaming in the narrow shard of sky cut from between… the silhouetted buildings. It hadn’t always been like this, this name, this\n\t\t\tlife,\n\t\t\talways having to be running from he knew not what. He straightened, and headed off into the twisting maze of city streets. The fire and noise in his head made\n\t\t\tfinding his way difficult, and for a while he wandered unsteadily through the city, eerily deserted at that early hour. ‘You’d better get going’ a voice\n\t\t\tsuddenly\n\t\t\twhispered softly behind his left ear. Georges stiffened, and, whirling round, saw nothing but the steam gently rising from a street vent. He set off at a\n\t\t\tsprint,\n\t\t\tmaking his way to the river winding its sinuous route through the city’s heart. This time he had guessed right, the tide was still out and, clambering down the\n\t\t\tsteps to the bank he found his car still parked where he had left it. Igniting, tyres screeched as the old Ford spluttered into motion. Georges was soon at the\n\t\t\tcity\n\t\t\tlimits, the car careered out onto the main road out of town and he headed east into the slowly rising sun. Later, driving fast out on the freeway, the wind\n\t\t\twhistling on the shield, he took the rise and, looking down over the vast expanse now spread before him he remembered the song that had stayed with him\n\t\t\tthrough everything else. The music remained, a piano and saxophone was all he needed. The haze had now lifted, he now knew what he had to do…\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.georgeskaplanpresents.com\" target=\"new\">Georges Kaplan Presents</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tplus……\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tJB NEWMAN & THE BLACK LETTER BAND JB Newman & The Black Letter Band bring you a shot of single malt rock ‘n roll with a shade of Noir style and a\n\t\t\tpoetic twist.\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jbnewmanmusic\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t+ Pat Fish ( The Jazz Butcher )\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"artist_website\">\n\t<b>Artist Website</b>:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/6182296219\" target=\"new\">Facebook</a>\n\t</span><!-- artist_website -->"},{"gigtext_id":730,"datetime":"2014-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Pat Fish solo and acoustic opening for the Lords of Thyme<br/>\n\t\t\tSpecial guest DJs and lights"},{"gigtext_id":731,"datetime":"2014-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Pat Fish solo acoustic, opening for The Lords of Thyme<br/>\n\t\t\tAlso on the bill: Son of Kirk."},{"gigtext_id":732,"datetime":"2014-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy (Featuring Max Eider on the Electric Guitar)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe are hoping to have vinyl copies of \"Last of the Gentleman Adventurers\" on sale at the Windmill.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe also plan to add at least one more show to the August dates with Max.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<b>After this gig, <!-- BEG:expanded_from:[person:Max Eider] -->\n\t<span class=\"person\">\n\t<a href=\"/people/max_eider.html\">Max Eider</a>\n\t</span>\n\t<!-- expanded_from:[person:Max Eider]:END --> announced his intention to no longer play live.</b>"},{"gigtext_id":733,"datetime":"2014-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The Jazz Butcher and his Gentleman Adventurers"},{"gigtext_id":734,"datetime":"2014-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"The Jazz Butcher Quartet"},{"gigtext_id":735,"datetime":"2014-06-27T20:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"In the Upstairs Bar\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tTHE JAZZ BUTCHER LOUNGE QUARTET"},{"gigtext_id":736,"datetime":"2014-06-27T20:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"This new rhythm section that I accidentally acquired earlier in the year is really starting to click.

We all know that missed some songs that were emblematic of those \"other 80's\", but is not noticed at all, since the chosen compositions drove us along the paths that he had prepared and constataban the brightness in the composition of a character charmingly fucking British pop, with many nuances loureedianos.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe next day, to mark the day discs specialty stores worldwide, Pat took his guitar and his beloved trumpet player and a mini concert discs marked in Amsterdam, with some other unexpected adaptation, like \"Take The Skinheads Bowling\" Camper Van Beethoven.\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tA Pat Fish must love him so his music has meaning, the freedom not to give in to fads or conditions, wasted talent whenever contact with the strings of a guitar or even when he sighs.

Disappointment was an inevitability.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFish failed to “get” the glam rock thing (probably too much of an excitable wee football fan) and found that the seventies drove him down some fairly obscure musical paths before punk rock came along to save the day. By then, however, all those mad little songs by Eno, Syd Barrett, Kevin Ayers, Daevid Allen, John Cale, Peter Blegvad and Tony Moore were already locked up in his head.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFish started making records under the name of the Jazz Butcher in 1983 and nobody has quite succeeded in putting a stop to this yet. He has recorded for Glass Records, Creation Records, ROIR of New York and Vinyl Japan of Tokyo. Overall he has written and released fifteen albums of original music, three live albums and innumerable singles and compilations.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 2016 Fire Records issued the album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers, originally released as a fan-funded project in 2012. In 2017 Fire will be undertaking a major re-issue programme, making several Jazz Butcher albums available once again on vinyl, CD and digital formats.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWith the Jazz Butcher, Fish has toured worldwide. As a solo artist, recent shows include Hamburg, Dortmund, New York City, Tokyo, Brussels and London, as well as his adopted home town of Northampton where he still regularly turns out with his acoustic guitar to support visiting artists.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHe likes collaborations, too. Apart from his lengthy association with Northampton-based digital hooligans Wilson over the years 2001-2009, Fish has recorded and appeared on stage with David J, Spacemen 3, Bristol’s The Blue Aeroplanes, German band M Walking On The Water, French indie art rock band Chelsea Paris and acclaimed Los Angeles shoegazers, The Black Watch.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe thing about Pat Fish is that he is not tribal about music. Some people know him from his friendship with Spacemen 3, others for his fondness for Nikki Sudden and Dave Kusworth; some know him because he has worked with members of Bauhaus, others regard him as a “classic” independent songwriter in the vein of Pete Astor or Dan Treacy. Fishy just fetches his acoustic guitar and his notebook and heads for the railway station.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHis current inspirations: as always, the Velvet Underground, Alex Chilton, Peter Laughner, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Kevin Ayers, John Martyn, Davy Graham and many, many more.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tDo you like your melodies sweet and your humour as black as pitch? Would you take a chance on something simple, intimate and direct from an artist who is on record as saying “What I do is not entertainment” but who regularly induces little bursts of outraged laughter from the audience? Do you want to see the real thing? You should maybe go and see Pat Fish.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<b>Plus</b>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSHORT STORIES: Formed in 2007 in Bristol, England by Tim Rippington and Stephen Miles. Tim and Stephen were at school together, a year apart but sharing the same musical values that made them firm friends. After school, the two went their separate ways – Tim spent the next twenty years playing in various indie bands such as the Flatmates, the Five Year Plan and later the Beatnik Filmstars. He also ran his own recording studio for five years, and produced records for, amongst others, the now legendary indie label Sarah Records. In 2003 Tim formed a new band Forest Giants, who made four great LPs before folding in 2007. In the meantime, Steve became a school teacher, dabbling only briefly in music with a spell as drummer for Bristol indie band Modesty Blaise.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 2007 the two met for the first time in 20 years, and discovered that they still had much in common and The Short Stories were born. Since then several albums and singles have been released which can be heard here, \n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"new\">https://theshortstories.bandcamp.com/</a>"},{"gigtext_id":757,"datetime":"2017-04-27T19:30:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"A very pleasant evening, much enhanced by Chef Watson and his most excellent rice, peas and plantain."},{"gigtext_id":758,"datetime":"2017-04-08T20:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Last Day Deaf is more than proud to announce that is Media Partner for the 8th April double bill (The Jasmine Minks, The Jazz Butcher Quartet) that will take place at The Continental, South Meadow Lane.Preston, UK.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe event is co-organised by  Tuff Life Boogie & They Eat Culture.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPress release\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jasmine Minks\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFormed in Aberdeen in 1983 before quickly re-locating to London, The Jasmine Minks were initially a quartet of Jim Shepherd (guitar/vocals), Adam Sanderson (vocals/guitar), Martin Keenan (bass guitar), and Tom Reid (drums/vocals). Alan McGee picked up on the band early on, and their first single, “Think!” (CRE 004) was in the second batch of releases on McGee’s fledgling Creation label in 1984. An amazing blast of fresh air and optimism, it was recorded for the princely sum of £50 at Alaska Studios, Waterloo. Another superb single, ‘Where The Traffic Goes’, and 18 minute mini-LP ‘One Two Three Four Five Six Seven, All Good Preachers Go To Heaven’ followed in quick succession before the end of 1984. All these records had a fetching, moddish art-pop slant and received outstanding reviews, with the Minks being nominated by NME as one of the best new acts in Britain.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFollowing a European tour, supported by McGee’s new protoges The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Jasmine Minks put out a punkier, Buzzcocks inspired, single, ‘What’s Happening’ in 1985 before embarking on recording their debut full length album, set to be named ‘Everybody’s Got to Grow Up Sometime’. This eventually emerged 18 months later, self-titled and patched together from a variety of different sessions after the original tapes were abandoned.\n\t\t\tIn-between times in 1986, the band released ‘Cold Heart’, a song that McGee had originally cut from ‘Preachers’ but which turned out to be their biggest selling single, single of the week in NME, and it also secured them a John Peel session. At this point Sanderson left the band and it took some time for Shepherd to take up the reins and carve out a new future for the Minks.\n\t\t\tJasmine Minks returned in 1988 with a new line-up, helmed by Shepherd (now on lead vocals and also sole songwriter) and their best album ‘Another Age’. This was an altogether more accomplished effort with a reflective mood, including the stand-out track ‘Cut Me Deep’, which also featured on Creation’s ‘Doing It For The Kids’ compilation the following year. Sadly, The Minks new crafted and considered approach was out of touch with the baggy loved-up zeitgeist and they managed just one more album , 1989’s ‘Scratch The Surface’ before they drifted apart in the early 90s.\n\t\t\tHowever, Jim Shepherd’s restless muse has led him to reconvene the Jasmine Minks several times since then, and McGee also never forgot his “amazing, unknown gem of a band” either, funding another album ‘Popartglory’ in 2001 on Poptones, the label he started after Creation’s demise. One of the tracks on that record, ‘Daddy Dog’, attracted an unprecedented period of notoriety for the band in Scotland, helped by featuring firebrand socialist politician Tommy Sheridan.\n\t\t\tIt is now 5 years since their last shows, and Jasmine Minks will be returning in 2017 playing their classic album ‘Another Age’ in full at their comeback show at The Continental.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher Quartet\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t“The Jazz Butcher is one of the most brilliant incisive pop writers that Britain has produced since the glory days of Ray Davies and Pete Townsend. Criminally overlooked by a media obsessed with the next big thing instead of what is actually good. A truly great songwriter” Alan McGee, president , Creation Records\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe Jazz Butcher is the nom de guerre of Northampton’s Pat Fish, who over the years has masterminded various Groups, Conspiracies, Sikkorskis from Hell and, latterly, a Quartet.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tA cult figure right from the start, The Jazz Butcher developed a not altogether serious sozzled Brit pop aristocrat persona, a million years before Brit Pop, with musical nods to Jonathan Richman (‘Roadrunner’ was memorably covered by the Butcher early on), Robyn Hitchcock and Lou Reed.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tPat formed the band in Oxford in 1982 (after he had previously been a member of Wow Federation while at university in the city) with Max Eider, who proved to be the Butcher’s most loyal co-conspirator. Max has now retired, but features on most of The Butcher’s 15 or so albums released since then, beginning in 1983 with ‘Bath of Bacon’, on Glass Records, alongside fantastic debut single ‘Southern Mark Smith’, regarded by absolutely everyone who’s heard it as one of the best songs of the eighties. Further albums on Glass, ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ and ‘Sex and Travel’ featured guest appearances from David J and Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn 1988 The Jazz Butcher instigated a transfer to Creation Records, where he became one of the label’s best loved acts, releasing seven albums for the label starting with ‘Fishcotheque’ in 1988 and ending with ‘Illuminate’ in 1995, with loads of drunken touring in-between, establishing enclaves of Butcher fanatics all over Europe and the States.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThereafter, Butchery continued, but very much underground, with only occasional peeks over the parapet such as the ‘Glorious and Idiotic’ album on Roir in 2000, until the Butcher’s legion of followers worldwide crowd-funded the ‘Last of the Gentleman Adventurers’ album in 2012.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRenowned archive trawlers Fire Records, have recently started up a Jazz Butcher reissue campaign, beginning in Feb 2016 with the long sold out ‘Adventurers’ album, and Pat is also back with a new band, the Jazz Butcher Quartet. Whilst Pat is often out and about solo in Northampton and the South, full Quartet shows are pretty rare, and he’s also not played in the North for a long time, so don’t miss this opportunity to see the legendary Jazz Butcher and his band at The Continental."},{"gigtext_id":759,"datetime":"2017-04-08T20:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"Preston went really well, with a really warm, responsive audience and a very kind host in Rico la\n\t\t\tRocca, who put the show on.

From the release of the band’s first album Bath of Bacon on Glass Records in 1983 up to their crowd-funded and self-released most recent album Last of the Gentleman Adventurers from 2012 (reissued by Fire Records in 2016), frontman Pat Fish (the Jazz Butcher himself) has led various incarnations of the group through a consistent (if somewhat sporadic in recent times) catalog of music to rival that any band out there. But much of the band’s music has been out of print for years, the victim of labels going out of business or being bought up, and of general bad luck. Fire Records has undertaken a project to right these wrongs, releasing a series of box sets collecting the band’s work. The first of these, The Wasted Years, came out last fall and collects the band’s four Glass Records-era albums. The second, The Violent Years, came out on Friday and collects the band’s first four albums (out of six total) for Creation Records. In honor of these releases, the current line-up held a performance last week at the storied 100 Club in the heart of London.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWhat might have been somewhat surprising, for a show meant to celebrate the reissue of such a storied back catalog, was how much of the night (a full half of the set) concentrated on the latest album, Last of the Gentleman Adventurers. After an introductory variant on the “Jazz Butcher Theme” from In Bath of Bacon, Fish and his band went directly to four songs from that record, “Animals,” “Tombé dans les pommes,” the title track, and “Black Raoul.” The record appeared two more times later in the set, with “Shakey” and “Solar Core.” Possibly an indication that Fish is more interested in the present than in dwelling too much in the past, but the songs are still very much classic Jazz Butcher material. Certainly no one in the audience seemed to mind.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tBut Fish and his current band (which has not yet appeared on any recordings) did make several nods back to the “classic” Butcher, with “Living In a Village” from 1988’s Fishcotheque, “Mr. Odd” from 1990’s Cult of the Basement, and “Shirley Maclaine” from 1991’s Condition Blue representing The Violent Years set, and “Party Time” from In Bath of Bacon. The arrangements of the songs were updated to fit with the latest line-up (particularly the impressive trumpet and flugelhorn playing of Simon Taylor, which added a unique tone to the music) but were still instantly recognizable.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe biggest surprise of the night for many was the inclusion of a new song, “Melanie Hargreaves’ Father’s Jaguar.” The band has been performing the track the track for a couple of years now, but it has yet to appear in recorded form. “You can’t buy this one anywhere. I guess that means it’s time for a new album,” teased Fish, to a roar of approval from the audience. Hopefully with the renewed interest that the box sets are generating, it won’t be too long until that becomes a reality.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe band closed out the evening with an encore of “Southern Mark Smith” from 1984’s A scandal in Bohemia. The enthusiasm of the audience even seemed to take Fish and the band by surprise, so they added one more song that wasn’t on the setlist, a cover of The Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner” (which the Jazz Butcher released as a single in 1984). “That’s all the songs we know!” Fish said, promising that the band would be back soon. True to his word, another set at the 100 Club, opening for The Bevis Frond, has already been announced for the end of May.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tSinger-songwriter Tim Keegan opened the show, performing songs from his most recent album The Long Game, self-released in 2015. A long-time cohort of performers including Robyn Hitchcock and The Blue Aeroplanes, Keegan had made a mark in the early-to-mid 2000s with his band Departure Lounge, but disappeared from the scene for several years. He says that he’s ready to stage a return, with a “proper” release of The Long Game followed by new material coming soon.\n\t\t</p>"},{"gigtext_id":770,"datetime":"2018-05-24T20:00:00.000Z","type":"notes","credit":"pat","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"CND 60th Anniversary celebration.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tShould be a good night.

It is likely my most prized\n\t\tpossession and it cost me nothing. They say meeting your idols can be dangerous as they may not live up to your idea of\n\t\tthem. More on that later...and sorry (not sorry) for the long post.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tThe Jazz Butcher has been the soundtrack of my life, from 1986 to present. Just like Thomas Peterson, Bloody Nonsense was\n\t\tmy first album, though the Canadian version differed a bit from the U.S. I never stopped listening to Pat. I loved and\n\t\tlove his music dearly. Like many of you have said, it got me through good times and bad and - I cry as I write this - I\n\t\towe him a lot.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tI'm glad I got to convey my gratitude to him over the years (many have used the word fandom in their posts) - Facebook\n\t\tMessenger is great that way for being able to reach out to people, even people you don't really know. And, as my wife\n\t\tKathleen and I planned a UK trip for April 2019 (remember travel?), I reached out to Pat and said we'd be coming up to\n\t\tNorthampton and I'd love to buy him a beer or five to show my appreciation for how much his music has meant to me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tMuch to my elation, Pat was game. We arrived in Northampton - couldn't get there any quicker, really, as we landed in\n\t\tLondon and pretty much took a train there immediately. And, after an initial scare where I didn't quite have his right\n\t\tphone number, Pat and I connected on Messenger again and agreed to meet at The Lamplighter for 7 pm. As our cab\n\t\tapproached, I saw this tall, harrowing figure walking into the pub and I knew it was him. This was happening - so many\n\t\tfeelings were swirling about inside me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWe introduced ourselves, grabbed pints and sat. And then - acutely starstruck - I pretty much forgot how to speak for\n\t\tabout 45 minutes. Luckily this rarely happens to my wife, so she held the fort during that time. I eventually came out of\n\t\tmy shell and...it was just wonderful. \n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t(BTW friends had asked me, before our trip, \"what will you ask him?\", and I purposely had no questions prepared. I didn't\n\t\twant this to be an interview and I didn't want it to be all about me. I just wanted to hang out with Pat and get to know\n\t\thim a little bit.)\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tHe was so gracious and generous. Beer and conversation flowed freely. He was kind and interested in us. We were then\n\t\tjoined by his good friend Rachel McGrath, who got me to express my fandom by asking me, at some point, what my top 5 JBC\n\t\tsongs were. I rhymed them off easily, with the top one being, since forever, Big Saturday (as I'm crying again).\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tImagine how over the moon I was when Pat invited us back to Fishy Mansions for a nightcap. How I held my cool, I've no\n\t\tidea - maybe the drink, or maybe by that time it was clear how genuine Pat was. And, around 1 am, Pat grabbed a guitar,\n\t\tand then my wife - I will forever be indebted to her - asked Pat to \"play Jean's favourite song, Big Saturday\". He\n\t\tobliged, and as I sob now, that's also me sobbing in the video at the beginning. I just lost it. I literally pinched\n\t\tmyself, couldn't believe this was actually happening.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tWhat a perfect evening getting to know a lovely human being, if only a bit. Meeting my idol exceeded my expectations and\n\t\tby far.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tIt is also incredible to have read your posts and know that this kind of interaction with Pat was commonplace. He made so\n\t\tmany people so happy by being so generous.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tFinally, as all of you, I am heartbroken today. My heart goes out especially to those who knew him much more so than I\n\t\tdid, his friends and loved ones. I am so sorry for your loss. It seems Pat was every bit as good to his loved ones that\n\t\the was to simple fans like me.\n\t\t</p><p>\n\t\tI treasure the memory of having met Pat and am so grateful to him, and for the fact that we still have his music.

He had been over once before to play in the bars, and \n\t\t\twas now negotiating some further dates with our friends there, The Purelove.\n\t\t\t<p />Once Max and I got wind of the plan, we thought that if we came \n\t\t\talong too, it might scare up a slightly larger audience for the Bald One to play \n\t\t\tto.\n\t\t\t<p />Besides, that way we would be able to get in on the free \n\t\t\tbeer.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Through the magic of e-mail we colluded with The Purelove boys \n\t\t\tto make it happen. Meanwhile Owen Jones, old school JBC drummer and Hamburg \n\t\t\tresident, returned from his trip to the Himalayas, and Max's \n\t\t\tharmonica-toting pal Pat Byrne joined up for the trip as well.

They did better than \n\t\t\tmany of the professionals, getting our picture in all the papers. But what a \n\t\t\tpicture! Particularly unkind to your ageing and toothless correspondent, \n\t\t\tyou'll be delighted to learn. We feared for our wages when we saw it!\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Still, it didn't deter 250 or so brave souls who came out \n\t\t\ton a wet Friday night to see the show. A couple came from England, some from \n\t\t\tBerlin, and one heroic couple from Olympia, Washington, USA. We tried to buy \n\t\t\tthem a beer, but the barman wouldn't let us pay. Back in the dressing room \n\t\t\tthis proved to be the case in many respects. A large posse of our Hamburger \n\t\t\tfriends were there, edging around the Great Clemens Kinder, who had set up a \n\t\t\tfull-on mobile studio in there in between the sandwiches and the beer.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />After the room filled up I was forced by the Hamburg Police to \n\t\t\tintroduce our one-man <I>Vorgruppe</I>, Curtis E. Johnson. I did my best to be \n\t\t\tencouraging and friendly, but I guess it all went a bit Robbie Williams. As I \n\t\t\tstepped back into the dressing room, leaving Curt to his fate, Max appeared and \n\t\t\tdeclared in warm, congratulatory tones,\n\t\t\t<p />\"That was truly ... nauseating.\"\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Shortly afterwards Nikki took me aside, urgently pleading:\n\t\t\t<p />\"When I come on to do my tune ... <I>please</I> \n\t\t\tdon't introduce me!\"\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Curtis went straight at the crowd, and although he later \n\t\t\tconfessed to feeling nervous, he won them over with the first two or three \n\t\t\tsongs. As he began to play Dougie MacClean's \"Caledonia\", Max, \n\t\t\tOwen and I found ourselves alone in the dressing room. Each of us sat in a \n\t\t\tchair, listening intently to this incredible tune. As we sat there, filling up, \n\t\t\tthe door opened and a friend of a friend stood there. He came in, looked around, \n\t\t\thung up his coat, then left. Nobody said a word the whole time. I caught up with \n\t\t\thim later and said \"You must think we're very strange people.\" \n\t\t\tBut it was the tune. When you hear Curtis sing it, you'll want to stop for \n\t\t\ta second too. It's a travelling song, but it's about memories and \n\t\t\thome and love, too. He couldn't have played a sweeter version for three \n\t\t\told boys with a history, sitting in the place that they all associate with all \n\t\t\tthat magic stuff possibly more than any other. The moment would have made the \n\t\t\twhole trip worthwhile for me if it had all stopped there.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />But <I>did </I>it all stop there, Churchill?\n\t\t\t<p />\"Oh NO.\"\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />For his last tune Curtis was going to do \"Hoochie Coochie \n\t\t\tMan\", and he had invited Pat to play harp with him on that tune. Pat spent \n\t\t\tmost of the tune standing on stage looking for the appropriate harp before \n\t\t\trealising that he simply didn't have that one on board and leaving again. \n\t\t\tCurt collapsed laughing and promptly buggered the connection on his guitar. He \n\t\t\tmade a graceful exit, sliding down those last four bluesy chords acoustic and \n\t\t\tleaving the stage to great applause.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />After a few minutes of mindless fun with the stage curtains, Max \n\t\t\tand I found ourselves on stage. For the first part of our set we were alone on \n\t\t\tthe stage, playing as a duo. One by one our pals would come out and join us to \n\t\t\thelp out on a particular tune. We had done the usual sort of shit with candles, \n\t\t\tbut we had also brought with us our secret weapon:\n\t\t\t<p />The Executaire.\n\t\t\t<p />As each musician joined us on stage we would greet him and pour \n\t\t\thim a glass of his favourite spirit from The Executaire, a 1950s style travel \n\t\t\tbar which was kindly donated to the cause by Bigrig Industries of San Francisco \n\t\t\tin 1997, and which we had filled for a stupidly low price with German Brandy, \n\t\t\tRussian Vodka and Mexican Tequila.\n\t\t\t<p />Apparently, a lot of the audience thought at first that we \n\t\t\tcalled Pat \"The Executaire\" (and it is only fair to point out that he \n\t\t\tis a bit of a natty dresser), but as more and more folks came on and had a drink \n\t\t\tthey began to see what was going on.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Here is the set that we played.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Partytime\n\t\t\t<br/>Whaddya?\n\t\t\t<br/>What's the Matter, Boy?\n\t\t\t<br/>Raking Up Leaves (Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Soul Happy Hour (Owen on triangle and vocals)\n\t\t\t<br/>It has to be You (Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Just Like Betty Page\n\t\t\t<br/>Angels\n\t\t\t<br/>Girls Who Keep Goldfish (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Nikki \n\t\t\tand Max on electric guitars, me on acoustic guitar)\n\t\t\t<br/>DRINK (Owen on drums vocals and kazoo, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Baby, It's You (Owen on accordion, Pat on harp, Curtis on \n\t\t\tbongos)\n\t\t\t<br/>The New World (Owen on snare drum, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Old Snakey (Owen on snare, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>The Human Jungle (Owen on bongos and vocals, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Who Loves You Now? (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on harp, me on \n\t\t\tbass)\n\t\t\t<br/>Girlfriend (Owen on snare and vocals)\n\t\t\t<br/>Rain (Owen on snare and vocals)\n\t\t\t<br/>Go-Go Gorilla/Caroline Wheeler (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on \n\t\t\tharp and tequila)\n\t\t\t<br/>Bigfoot Motel (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>The Long Night Starts (Owen on Nepalese drum, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>Zombie Love (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<br/>Water\n\t\t\t<br/>Take the Skinheads Bowling (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on \n\t\t\tharp, Curtis rapping)\n\t\t\t<br/>Roadrunner (Owen on snare and vocals, Pat on harp)\n\t\t\t<br/>My Desert (Owen on accordion and vocals)\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />And then it was time to party.\n\t\t\t<p />I managed to spend a few minutes thinking I'd lost my \n\t\t\twallet (I had - in Owen's kitchen!), then we split to Markstube for \n\t\t\tsenseless drinking. We'd had a great time and made ourselves a little \n\t\t\tmoney. The show had a really warm vibe. At times it felt like we were getting \n\t\t\taway with murder, but at the same time we sort of knew that what we were doing \n\t\t\twas all right. My favourite moment came in \"Goldfish\" where it turned \n\t\t\tout that Max and Nikki had a plan : they both played the guitar solo \n\t\t\tsimultaneously! I sat there strumming on my acoustic laughing my head off. To \n\t\t\tthink that some unlucky bastards can't even find one good guitarist. Some \n\t\t\tguys have all the luck. In Hamburg anyway.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />We spent the subsequent weekend having all kinds of twisted fun. \n\t\t\tCurtis gatecrashed a blues night in a pub, met (and got autographed by) \n\t\t\tHamburg's most celebrated hooker, ran away from a predatory circus owner, \n\t\t\tlost his crabs in the fish market at dawn and never went to bed ever. The rest \n\t\t\tof us prowled from The Onion to the Bar Zentrale, stopping in at a bar that \n\t\t\tsomebody had named after Max where we played table football and drank nameless \n\t\t\tshorts of various colours. As Max said, even in Hamburg terms we had an extreme \n\t\t\ttime.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />By Monday night we were all back home, older if not wiser, and \n\t\t\tlooking forward to the showdown with Martin Stephenson at the Racehorse in \n\t\t\tNorthampton on Friday.\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />Viva La Executaire!\n\t\t\t<p />\n\t\t\t<p />&copy; Pat Fish 1999"},{"gigtext_id":1130,"datetime":"1999-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":"selfreview","credit":"","credit_url":"","credit_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","body":"I'm in recovery.\n\t\t<p />\n\t\tThe Brothers were in town last night, playing a show.
